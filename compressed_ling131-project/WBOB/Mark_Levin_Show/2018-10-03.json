because you put it in a five hundred degree of it and you just absolutely new thing you cook it for three hours\nAnd the skin becomes so correctly they it's a delicacy and I was talking to various it's Stuart what's yours and I was expecting something completely\nDifferent fish and chips I Would think a very recently\nI was expecting something British uh but he said exactly the same thing and apparently it's a it's a an English thing it's popular in Australia and so that's one of the recipes in the in the cookbook if in fact it's on the back cover the darn thing\nBeautiful and you've got a lot of very cool recipes in here that ... by you and your wife too which is a which is really something worth looking and let me ask you a question here is\nNew York times comes up with this long article and I now read most of it really trashing the president trashing his father trash can making these these these brought statements about how they're essentially tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years\nAnd um\nAnd they and they basically lost the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for\nNow the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right and this is a huge uh you know family business it's a privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff so I don't know if it was in the\nIn the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump as he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up isn't it for the Democrats will keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of hand in glove working with each other here in the political way\nBut that's their playbook that's all they've got I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy\nAnd why did they lose because he cheated and he didn't just cheat at you know colluding with the Russians he cheated his entire business career and his family cheated his dad cheated they screw people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and ... you know the allegation is you know\nHe had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars but you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read\nFor a hundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he was in a self made guy he was a bold into his father who was a cheater as well\nCrazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now it's just one of these allegations that it's been linked to a major\n... isn't it isn't it isn't just a problem a huge article yes one allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though\nI don't ever remember anything like this and the Kennedy family or had LBJ became a multimillionaire just a poor man they got elected to the Senate he dies a multi multi millionaire I mean so much and and Trump makes all this money before even enters the presidency\nAnd they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective that are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or\nHave worked with politician he would you want to talk about a collusion look at the link between the press and some a\nLiberal Democrats for instance I I was watching the special report program on Fox News and a a young correspondent who used to live at my house or Peter do see that who you were talking about a minute ago you know he's out in Montana and he was covering the story about uh the reelection campaign of John tester\nAnd Jon Tester's got a problem right now because\nA lot of Montanans are veterans and they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who is the president's picked to run the VA\nBecause if you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing\nHe had these pages of stuff about how Ronny Jackson was drunk and\nHe crashed the car some place and he did these inappropriate things and he was given people bills and all that stuff\nYou know what then it got into the bloodstream of the media and everybody was talking about it in the White House came out like within a day and said look we've done a a an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or these other allegations\nBut the damage was done and he was dead it was a kill shots and it all started with unfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today\nHow many

three different answers as to when the assault happened\nMid eighties early eighties and all of a sudden actually was the summer in Nineteen eighty two after she lawyers up\nYou have to believe that she waited waited\nReally until now to reveal that the individual who assaulted her was in fact judge Kavanaugh never said anything\nAnybody else although her husband now has circled back and said oh I remember her telling me doing marriage therapy okay we'd like to see the notes they won't return or they won't release enough so that does not believable\n\nShe can't remember a key details about the night who invited her to the party how she heard about the party how she got to the party how she left the party where the houses exactly with any specificity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she\nTraveled back home when she got back on\n\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by a single person including none of the people she's named including as well her lifelong girlfriend\nLeland Kaiser that apparently is not change based on reports today she hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions ever therapists notes to the report and others in July the\nWhole copy of the therapists notes or read from the therapists no she doesn't remember she can't remember if she had an actual copy the therapist knows when she called the Washington Post or she had gone to her therapist's office and read the notes can't remember any of that she won't provide the notes to the committee\n\nShe won't provided to the committee she can't remember the day that she had the polygraph to this is very reason just what a month six weeks eight weeks ago whether it was on the day her grandmother passed away or not she can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\nIf in fact she was traumatized during the course of the [noise] excuse me lie detector tests did she claims\n\nShe talks about the psychological

flown west coast east coast east coast the west coast she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica all over the world\nBut when she was asked to show up for a hearing she couldn't fly\n\nAlthough it is said that she was already on the east coast [noise] she didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California to interview her in any form\n[noise] and uh\nWhy didn't you know people say her lawyers must have withheld that information maybe the large didn't withhold the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright answer\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and then a few years before that that the day that we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment there was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kevin O's named to her boyfriend her live in boyfriend of six years so you have to\nBelieve the unbelievable\nTo believe her testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must spend your reasoning and now that I've gone all through that she's not the bubble lady\nShe came forward she said it was a civic duty she's presented herself to the American people and we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor have to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that and we're not doing that\nNow what a cabinet and say that was so unbelievable or contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\n\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nBut you see the FBI didn't interview him or Ford now according to forge lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are on in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play what see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles where the Democrats say enough already and missed her flight and ms Collins of ms Murkowski viewing is wrong with the Democrats go ahead we're having a vote this is over\nWe're not going to participate in any further sham we're not going to participate now and the trashing the FBI I'm not talking about

and PBS news\nIn the poll eighty two percent of Democrats in eighty percent of Republicans say the upcoming elections are very important\nThat negligible to point difference and voter enthusiasm is down from eight ten point edge Democrats held when marriage pose that question in July and much lower than other polling ... earlier this fall\nThe Democrats lead on the generic congressional ballot also ... points in September to six points now slightly below what they'll need to feel confident and winning the house this fall\nThe poll does find that a solid plurality of voters believe Dr

another poll out there that says that when you tell the same responded that there's not a single witness ... operation or any evidence\nThen the support moves to Kavanaugh you see\n\nThis is just one
