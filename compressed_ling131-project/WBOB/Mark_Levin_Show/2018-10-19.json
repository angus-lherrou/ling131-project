I I think Republicans are going to hold I feel like they are a whole the majority in the house and they're going to\nGain seats in the Senate and that would absolutely be a huge red wave because by all historic precedent\nAnd based on the media coverage right now Democrats should win the ... if they don't win the majority that has a huge story that that would be that would be a a a dog by a man bites dog kind of story it's unpleasant but then uh this past weekend I spend time with my brother from Michigan who lives in Michigan and he said oh there's something going on out there\nThat really is I'm worried I'm looking at some of these races in suburban Michigan something that should be Republican seats and the women are angry women are really angry and at the the Kavanaugh things not playing the same I is it\nAre you hearing that lady's ... I Want to hear from you are used on saying not as well or your friends telling you that or is it quite the opposite of what I think that I'm seeing right now that women especially women and Republican

weapon it was five and I I cannot believe that there are people out there that fell for it you know ...\nThank you ... you made a great point and coming from your perspective as a feminist from or or you know growing up in the feminist movement as a baby boomer of this whole thing is the opposite of empowering women it's painting all women as victims Larry O'Connor the market within show now\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one that just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nIs significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why men to share is so\nWhere all you and you and your mates all you know you you do you all take your separate cars and you follow each other down the expressway to get to the campsite all\nCome back we're going to Canada and at the beach but it's all ... up to the mountains will go fishing it's going to be a care that it's terrific\nHave you seen these pictures have you seen the video of the they all have by the way everyone in this uh this migration this this is the invasion this reprehensible international crisis that make no mistake is\nSimple international crisis ... make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happened it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorites search engine and type in Honduran caravan organizers they'll give you the list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back down to earth\nBut there's still people organizing this of course it would be a notice that that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird isn't that odd\nThe brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation our Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop us [noise]\nAnd if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we going to do you know the\nDemocrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill\nDon't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international list for being all about open borders for being compassionate\nUh you know what's compassionate\nCompassionate does not enabling people to continue\nTo follow the same broken destructive patterns that they have a year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change\nThe Honduran government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras I'd get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nBut that will remember when we all love the Arab Spring were we had people rise up against their governments\nAcross the middle east because they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central Americans spring why as the default obligation for America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries come when we got your back\nWhy is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American ... if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values are you kidding me since when\nAnd how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in do you think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't\nThey keep coming why because we let that men\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat\nSenator Ben carton or he is a senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led lesson 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\n[noise] when one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan Democrats or Republicans it's rooted in President Trump's budget we want to improve the living conditions are those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHere and he goes on on this and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the the highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and\nThink about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n\n... we're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there\nTo get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter hunger and that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country and they're\nAngry at us for saying no they can't come in but think about that for a minute you're an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who are elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere and your responses not gene maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your responses how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my an apt to corrupt government to come into your country\n... these countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing their own and then you've got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables at who enables at by throwing more money at it\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today\nAnd if you want you can get the whole interview over at my radio station to be a male dot com but I I came back around and said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\nBut I don't know if I'll agree with you on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI out of Central America\nThe statement I I've been in bed with the FBI down a Central America I Know how dangerous the\nBirds are by the way I grew up as let me just to be these ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with them we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nI find you did you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I understand the danger factor as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up in our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America and some cases the habit loop that fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nIf they have a legitimate claim for a song that should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper\nOkay hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nThat a great deal I don't disagree with you one\nAnd then I'm going to positive for a minute 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate and we need to follow international protocols for asylum seeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum\nBut living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago would be claiming asylum in Toronto right now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "19"}
