trying to turn the story and the Trump um that's perfectly fine things say whatever they want about Trump it's just a an easy just just far away\nBut if you bring up the fact that Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these ah these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said whether it was ... center

[noise]\nThis is going to be a one party town and will be like Chicago or Baltimore where you don't have different voices you know speaking up and and working\nFor our local region and so I think it's really important that we have a voice that it's going to be able to work with the administration for priorities for the northern Virginia\nNow here's here's your opponent West is not just a Democrat and I will be fine she's a radical she will join the radicals in the house of representatives I mean the hard core radicals reopen border radicals the mass\nOf government radicals and so forth and so on and I'm Nancy\nPelosi is put in over a million dollars in the race and now Bloomberg's coming in and doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which is the racist tied very close\nAnd they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you we're we're in here we're fighting because if we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans celebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help\nAnd the press doesn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about results there about resistance I'm about you know getting things\nThat improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed by and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups of back your opponent\n[noise] um well the uh the the metro union group that as a running an attack\nOut I keep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah and violate the law\nAnd they're attacking me for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this ... this is a union that was so you know that's functional that the Obama administration support it suited\nAnd that to supporting her and and other union groups but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put\nHer own staffing to fake parties city costumes for police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety on let me\nLet me ask you this before we run out of time roads big deal in northern Virginia [noise] on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is she\nWas she was ... that there is forty six dollar told that you see when you're ... you're going to Washington she was for them before she was against them and you know she was on the committee that you know that they put through that but more importantly is she saying she was against them\nYet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place how she was ineffective in persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know at the FBI or the CIA all this you know that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting vis a character that they are not today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything I'm In and get rid of those forty six dollar toes and so we need someone who's affected\nWho can work with you know a Republican administration or Democrats I've demonstrated that and and I've always been someone advocating lower taxes Terry and public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI Do uh you are in a tough district to marginal districts\nIn what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others\nAnd the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out to what they've done and the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to all of a nights out there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as
