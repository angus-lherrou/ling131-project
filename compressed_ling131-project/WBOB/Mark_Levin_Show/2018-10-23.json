by name\nNobody can seriously conclude that Don Lemon there's any kind of journalist or reporter he's a buffoon nobody can seriously argue that Brian stopped there is any kind of reporter or journalist he's a buffoon and you go right down the list\n\nRight down the list nine things you need to know about illegal immigration and crime this is two years ago the daily wire Byron band blur number one federal state local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime out of the public purview\nFox News reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement ice and I love ice\nI've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrants crime are not available from the federal government that suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local governments so in other words\nIt's the official position of the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics\nNot to track it they track everything except that\nNumber two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population Fox News sorted through married local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder\nThe ticks and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their three point five percent share of the U.S population would suggest now why isn't this information reported today\n\nOn good morning America on the today show\nBy ... by Wolf Blitzer why not\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox Thirteen point six percent of those sentence for all committed crimes of the country ... percent of murders sentences sixty percent of trafficking sentences\nNumber three this is a daily wire almost fifty percent of federal crimes were committed near the Mexico border\nA report from the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives these specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences and twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventy percent of drug trafficking sensors and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nAren't how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics\nI thought big government leftist watch the testing\nNumber five a disproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter personnel in remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer\nReview statistics from the government Accountability Office and the research center and compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven\nAre illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and legal non citizens and it goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are\nPersonal knowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates isn't a perfect measurement ... difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding that legal residence at least when it comes to major crimes\nBut the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison just for homicide related offenses in California alone\n\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and aren't large in the country\nIn twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that involved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and sixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or manslaughter convictions\nAnd this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not\nOver convicted\nIncarcerated and then fried illegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to you understand that Florida you understand what I'm Talking about [noise] you've got a radical cook\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I return\n\nAnd not to mention the shedding I went back in the car at three times a week Freda with scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the day keeping me awake whole entire night from all the scratching and chewing it kinda makes you never\nDoes your dog each scratch speakership like crazy\nTown and they found that for all over the place come to a dynamite for help\nAnd I don't know if he wants to talk now you got to see the country how China is Tricia pie at three fatty I think\nOur vitamins and ends and replace the nutrients cooked out most commercial dark boots\nTake all of it I came up all night scratching his shutting minimal and it is such a pleasure Mike ... non shedding I'll be back and I have to think I Know for that\nSanctuary cities have hampered law enforcement of cracking down on gangs the great Heather Mac Donald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers\nAll the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status has illegals\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law\nFor exercise I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\nThe\nIssue is that these gang members\nTended to sneak back into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes of police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a crime\nNumber nine\nClimate is also increased among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David front of the Atlantic\nNo hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a cook but anyway I wrote in twenty Fifteen that as a twenty alive and there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants\nServing murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hubs including Houston\nMalarkey Phoenix San Diego you got that\nGloria border you idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states have California Texas Arizona\nFlorida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of the total population in those states\nNow there's no denying the fact is\n\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida but doesn't that problem with this\n\nWas a criminal illegal alien his release from prison rather than having a did painter do hold them for the feds to deport them Gillum says abolish ice and no we're not gonna work to get a dead painter now think about that Florida\n\n[noise] think about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of the United states the Democratic party or the Democrat Party it's the official position to abolish ice it's the official position that localities in states local and state law enforcement should not work with ice\n\nThey've smeared ice\n\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects\nThe interior of the United states\nFrom illegal and criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV this the news parts of cable TV so called\nYou didn't hear any of this instead all you heard all day today and yesterday was trashing Trump\nThat's what you've heard you've heard\nReporters yell at the ... do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that\nMy response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are terrorists the whole point is there a legal allies are not going through the vetting process while the president said they're criminals among them the terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're all\n\nCriminals know what they're doing parents know what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something\n\nBut that's not even the point they're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\n\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law they don't have that same passion for American citizens who may get their taxes wrong or maybe violate Obamacare and so forth and so on\n\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democratic party in the media have romanticized illegal immigration that romanticized illegal aliens\nThat's the propaganda that's going on in this country that the illegal immigrant is noble or better more hard working then the American citizen and\nThese fools and the Democratic party and
