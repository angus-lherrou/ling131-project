taking a call from a pollster either who's on the other end of that line\nYou don't have time you're busy you have a job that's where the polls were so wrong almost every time that's why they've been

policies that Walker and the Republicans of Madison to put forth I sure hope he wins is a good man\nI promise you another article to show you how the resistance in it's insidious way is a is is stopping and impeding the regular functions of our government and this one in real clear investigations this article which also share on my Twitter Larry O'Connor [noise]\nUh this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg\nIs behind it all the headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state governments it's by Jeff patch it real clear investigations to very well researched investigation is a long article give you the synopsis of it though and New York University School of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg\nWho by the way he wants to be president he's officially he will be running for the Democrats are going to be like twenty twenty five nominees running for the Democrats their first debate\nIs like in six months it's going to be in spring of twenty Nineteen I Can't wait it's going to be phenomenal to see them all you eat each other alive and tried to be a ... as socialist as possible to win the nomination it's going to be a complete disaster for them and I can't wait I'm popping the popcorn now\nMichael Bloomberg is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute\nEnergy companies and challenge Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment you understand what that opening something said\nThis is the program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg and they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd and their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\nTo sue the Trump Administration and energy companies nine\nStates continuing down the article nine states and Washington DC including New York Illinois in Pennsylvania are participating in a multi million dollar program funded by the media magnate an ex New York city mayor\nWho re registered as a Democrat this week amid expectations of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteen current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general but they are paid\nBy NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names the state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG offices hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as special assistant attorney general D.C Howard city assistance\nThey're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeting government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nSays outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center\nWarner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the age you offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner set\nThey but hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we\nGot it we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBlumberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program NYU than hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThey answer to the attorney general but you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of view the voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically then sous Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why what whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PTA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking or oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos\nAnd this is going on in your state\nAnd it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA that President Trump is in charge of\nAnd why because they can't win at the ballot box they can't win in the elections and so they just throw a bunch of money at lawyers and they tried to sue everybody to try to get their way and try to push their agenda\n\nI'm Larry O'Connor that this is the market within a month", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville",
