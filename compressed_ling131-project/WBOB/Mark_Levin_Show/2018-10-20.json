saying\nWell first of all our believe in a comprehensive immigration solution stopped them mid sentence if you get the opportunity I watch the comprehensive\nImmigration means we're gonna throw all of this garbage into one giant bill that everyone has to vote on\nAnd it'll include border protection and it'll include asylum and it'll clue to amnesty into clued path to citizenship and no clue you know the ... visas to bring in some a computer nerd from India and all of these things and you stop and say well why\nWhy why why does all of that other stuff\nWhy does that need to be part of this solution this is a very cut and dry standalone problem there are people from another country\nWho are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution for these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all these other things that you want voted on an approved then it means your part of the problem you're using this to get other things that you want\nI Am so against the idea of comprehensive anything reform in Congress I think every individual items should be voted on standalone do you want to wall or not well okay well go ahead and fund the wall but only if you get an amnesty for people in the country already\nWhat's one got to do with the other\nTell you what let's have a vote on the wall and then we can have your vote on amnesty step up this is not about compromising this is not about trading horses this is not about making a deal\nEither you're for protecting our border or you're not

know often sits in this chair as well and I've known down since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the doors and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nAh I recently this we got to interview Carter Page not Carter Page is a central figure\nOf the uh Spygate scandal right ah and and the the he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the Democratic National Committee and against a Perkins ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party ... and especially I\nImplore you read Donald Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happened her experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess was completely mess and she she tells a lot of troops in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in and they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know sly and Carter Page or that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nThey call the shots so not Carter Page this week fired adept filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... not well why do they go after those it will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly [laughter] that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities that wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a a five to warrant\nThe petition for and approved or to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through the fights accords for them to survey on him\nTo look into every little or if his of his electronic footprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it is real Pfizer Warren and\nThey're supposed to be a very high bar to get a five to warrant\nAnd to get this fights weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the ... weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there and black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty six date on\nBehalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\nSo Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week suing the DNC and Perkins covered this law firm for defamation and I think about this from it\nCarter Page is either an agent of the Russian government and basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been signed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other right\n... there's no in between here there's no if and or certainly no but I mean if there was a button here it would be a car Daschle and proportions\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a stew age of the prudent Kremlin\nOr he is completely innocent\nAnd you know I don't know if you know a lot about Carter pays like I say it hasn't been a lot of a media [noise] he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise] he was in intelligence in the navy\nAnd an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise] um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his an academy education\nHe then went into private business and did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about the ever noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he did\nHe's a doctor he got his doctorate and he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his feelings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had to reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a rock Obama was promising his counterpart there but he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy in won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says that's what that's not a legal\nHe he can do that in fact that it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nYou know sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has a right to do that that doesn't make him a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here\nCarter Page could very well be\nAn agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that has presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and bled um are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not\nBeen charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin pollutants Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that\nWere true why would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect affect the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court and well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense all well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are an agent\nOf the Russian government why would you do that would you do that and I again I I he couldn't be\nAn agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck in Andrew McCabe in ... Lynch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then oh so much of it got leaked to the press shocking how much of it got linked to the press they could all be true\nAm six hundred double you'll be you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them W.\nTwos ...

helping the folks out in the panhandle um how is it out today it's terrible I mean while hits terrible well it's a much more destructive storm over a much wider pass\nA for a much longer period of time you know we see hurricanes come on shore like Florence did enough orange was destructive to it came on stroller and then\nPretty much die down to a big rain event but the reign of it lasted for days and days and days and days those are the situation where a storm came on shore in a very highly populated area a very big tourist areas right out a lot of tourists related Venus along the beach\nOr over a wide path about forty miles wide and then moved on shore as one\nMile an hour short of a category five storm\nAnd moved on reasonably slow and then by the time it got to the Florida Georgia border it was still a cat three still a category three storm there was not much ... wants to slow it down continued on up into the main part of Georgia and then back into South Carolina North Carolina again and became another rain event which is not what those folks need it\nBut if you'd never traveled out to the panhandle area\nA big portion of the economic influence out there is tourism\nPrisons and lumber\nAnd the prisons systems obviously the prison cells the jail houses the buildings\nAre built really really strong so they're okay but the trees around them the electricity leading to them the\nRoads leading to this facility is covered with trees the railroads covered with trees that were blown down from the right of ways transmission lines trunk lines lateral lines

devil I mean a Gillum is promising to people I Want to say this to everybody out there I Love everybody black white green\nBut when I make the statement I Want everybody to check me out fact check and do to\nPick a Cuba around Nineteen fifty eight fifty nine before Fidel Castro got in and he was invited and he didn't he wasn't the Occupy an occupying army it didn't take over he was a popular figure I Want you to go to a\nA Venezuela I watch it also go to to uh Zimbabwe which was formally Rhodesia went in Smith declared the independence of Nineteen eighty one it was the bread basket they chose the breadbasket of Africa very prosperous country\nOr black people in other people who are listening and all the Gillum what he's going to do just remember that if you look at Cuba now what you want to go live in Cuba\nVenezuela or Zimbabwe\nAnd kill them is promising the same thing\nAnd I hope that people here are not stupid enough I mean you go on a computer is the major say I know Marty makes sense but I Want to double check it would just go on on uh just type in Cuba pre Castro where they had the the the gambling and everything it was very prosperous prosperous place\nAnd then then look at it and listen to what's going to say the devil the devil speaks Atari a vet is very pleasant to your air\nBut is not really good what he does to people and that's on that thing and I also wanted to mention though I envy you for being able to help the Americans and the hurricane area I don't want to mention that last year\nWhen we had Hurricane Irma when we were out electric for about\nA I think it was a little bit close to a day they rose at that time the linemen and the power companies and you know even though somebody said they're getting paid\nI wouldn't want to be working with electric lines because there are some accidents or whatever so in cases like that all of those utility people\n... the tree people and everybody who's helping to give us back the quality of life that we have I Want to thank everybody and I want to thank you bill and you're an asset near a gym for a community and thanks for being there\nThanks Marty I I Know very well and you are listening\nMarty Marty Marty is less than my show since ... years ago when I was on on Saturday morning purchased an hour like at nine o'clock in the morning when nobody was awake and if they were awake they sure as heck didn't want to listen to some guy spout about politics but Marty and\nMarty you you need to do a favor for Mardi since you are near you need to do a special show for him and just send it to 'em when you're not on hair\n\nRecorded tape era mark let me tell you what not for me on this trip he's on this beautiful treaties with his wife\nEasy in a fjord in Norway and this is an honest beautiful boat all these vistas around imagine being in a fjord ... services and the snow capped mountains and the trees and he tells his wife excuse me hunting are going to run downstairs 'cause it's eight to nine o'clock in America and I've got a call bill hey on his\nTalk show and sure enough goofball cause me as as smarty I'm calling from up your way and I'm like this has gotta be at thirty dollar a minute phone was more than that\nHome Depot yeah or it can be shaved and used in laminated plywood like the half inch CTX most of it's a so badly nodded because it's time that it has to be used a in a CTX or the BBC great plywood that's filled\nThe this story the bad story is and I did not know this but there is such a thing as timber industry insurance\nYou can buy insurance based on the value of timber and the premiums for that insurance goes up based on the number of years that field has been planted\nBut there was a gentleman who had a grove of pine trees some acreage uh-huh and the value was about six million dollars\nWow that's but he had no timber insurance on all his temper was destroyed a new value of it now is less than ten thousand dollars\nJust OK due to a corollary to that that back forty years ago the government encouraged a lot of these people that have acreage to plant trees\nAround here so many people planting trees that they're not coming to harvest Twenty years later and they what they are anticipating being annuity when they retire became into an absolute disaster ... there is\nThis is good news bad news may be so many trees have been destroyed with\nThis most recent a hurricane that those that were left might actually benefit but up until this current hurricane the actual planning that every but the government and courage than they are obviously not always right\nThey encouraged all these we have too many acreage under a tree farming rented it really yes and the value of the lumber and pines has been devastating over the last twenty uh literally three or four years\nSo here's a here's an interesting Yeh is an add on to that I was talking to someone who is in the tree industry he was on board the aircraft telling me about the amount of devastation the panhandle as sustained and he said in the coming months you see the price\nOf oh asked me and ... began oriented strand board okay you will see the price of O. S. B.\nPlummet plum really\nYes because the market will be flooded with all of these trees that will be turned into sb ... that might but the price of structural lumber like a two by four to buy six to buy tend to by twelve huh will go through the roof because there will be very little harvesting of non hurricane affected structural\nSo this would be the thing so yes if you looked at the dynamics the price of that is gone down so how much you will go bounce back up because of what I just said because up until a couple of\nThis past year all that price so much it was coming on board that you've eliminated and now they might actually bounce up to where they weren't maybe two years ago versus what they were six months ago to\nPray and here's a sidebar that we haven't talked about yet another side where it was not a bar to the heart is not a bar bar and you know you don't want to hear a story about the bar bar because all of the adult entertainment facilities that were around\nTen dull and Eglin uh-huh were destroyed all of them they're they're already doing they're gone there and they don't want us there in Atlanta New Orleans Pensacola somewhere else they're gone\nBiloxi I don't know maybe I don't I don't know I don't know if you're a professional out I'm a professional bachelor um that's why I'm asking [laughter] last time I show again [laughter] she's only last night show half [laughter] um [laughter]\nThe the structural lumber industry is is curtailed but the new industry in the panhandle that's only come on board in the last year or so and I was able to fly over some of these grow houses\nThe marijuana industry is thriving in the area of Quincy and I'm just south of Marianna in that area around this needs area and the greens borough area these guys are putting in these huge and here's another thing I didn't want to comment about running on marijuana\nAs part of the state marijuana you know ... marijuana thing right you have to grow it indoors\nMan it has to be grown indoors because they're sort of charity\nYeah when you go to I have\nBeen here and can you not imagine half a guy that's out you know the lid trying to climb over a ten foot Bob Barr fantastic\nYou know ... ... but\nFirst of all the nurseries that are doing this they have ... a razor wire on the top ... everywhere and I've been to one but but what is interesting on all these people that want marijuana you know what the downside is they use ... ... ... ... near mount of water\nAnd they also use it extraordinary amount of electricity to grow so you know when all these people\nAre saying that they produce an extraordinary\nProduct I don't know that but I\nIs that in Colorado When they were doing recreation and you could do to plants you could always tell people these this is what I was told you can always tell people that were doing multiple many more trees than that because there are electricity would go\nAnd I was told you can always tell people that were doing multiple many more trees than that because there are electricity would go up in order to go up and all these environmentalist that want to say cut back on water do this go do that there are on the opposite [laughter] and they want that marijuana which actually conflicts with what their position is on the environmental issue and that was my point\nYou know at at it is to add to that before we get back to Paul and derby on the phone I'm I I I won't say which sheriff's department but I used to have the privilege of flying in the sheriff's department helicopter or a county somewhere down in the south central part of the state they had a flirt unit obviously for finding bad guys when they were running\nBut that floor you know it was also that's forward looking infrared thank you I'm Sorry with you and the well\nAnd I got him I Know and it was I was ready to say what is that accurate means because you're just talking to people that don't\nKnow I Know him has been on me all week there's a truck called a pocket he doesn't believe that there's an acronym for a ... he's calling it something else in al empty and and Tim and I go back and forth on ... that the entire flight anywhere sometimes Tim and I'm fighting over an acronym ...\nIt was supposed to start keeping you up at night oh it was when I hear\nThey're not because some of the girls were calling Loretta low low and I said yeah they're calling her low low and he got into an argument with me over whether or not the young ladies\nPet's name was low low I have to sometimes leave the room just because we argue over acronyms anyway\n[laughter] I'm I'm ... I had an opportunity to fly with the sheriff Brian and what's really interesting is at night some of the officers when the department has money to send officers up at night you can actually fly over\nOver people's three bedroom two bath homes yeah and you know most of them are calm cool because they're running their air condition and everything's great and then all of a sudden you fly over a guy that's got a garage but he's cars parked in the driveway\nAnd his garage is glowing like a camp fire in the alert unit and they the officer just makes a noted that address ... because\nThat generally indicates that they've got a grow house it that way she's going on in Iran been could have been tomatoes ...\nNo that's okay but anyway it it it's easier to find what it is it's a question if they're actually enforcing the rural and you read it again and you ... ... is a cash business so yeah so whenever you're paying your belt is all cash thing if you\nIf you find marijuana plants growing outside right above us got a couple of five gallon pickle buckets out behind the bar yeah if you're flying over\nIt's the most amazing thing because marijuana plants are green unlike any other

than the FBI is certainly not going to tell the media until their investigation is complete and then at the completion of their investigation they will decide whether or not\nTo release that yes he helped us or no he was the subject\nTo release that yes he helped us or no he was the\nSubject of the investigation I Can't as a journalist just pick up the phone and go hello FBI I'd like to know what you're investigating they would then send one of their officers by here with a shiny their cost to tell me exactly how much information they were not going to give me\nTwo things he first of all your your life you're you're ... you're innocent until proven guilty you also are judged by the company you keep and finally I'll say this about go he\nIs running on a public safety record in Tallahassee and his chief of staff\nIs running for mayor to replace him as mayor and he's running a public safety has gone up eighty nine percent in the last four years\nSo if I were to saint this I'd be running both those ads simultaneously to say Gillum says this thing and the truth is what is chief of staff says about safety but well\nThen by the way people don't care if he said being investigated the world is it's about how pretty is and how how good he sounds that's the image that we now have going forward as elected officials\nAnd and then the substance that he is following in the same tracks that President Obama that he's a great orator he tells everyone exactly what they want to hear but not necessarily what's good for them and and when I met\nYesterday Chris King on the

they down here uh you know helping out\nTheir own citizens and what they don't realize is that there were Republicans scattered all over the state helping citizens and they were doing it more than just for a photo op\nThey were actually collecting food water in their own community and send it that way by the way most politicians like this they're interfering what the actual process right\nNow I

little tiny ... plane that they had both for him to get into and I looked at him and I realized no\nNo disrespect but I realized how much I had watched that man age\nFrom Nineteen eighty one to the president went from a vibrant young forward thinking man it wasn't just a straight Democrat boat was a man who thought about both sides of the aisle to a man who is now an elderly man just barely able to get into the plane\nAnd and I thought to myself\nWe ate with kittens can't go on\nThere is no forward thinking left in this man no he's become a part of his best days are behind him and now he's just listening to what other people tell him and there's no guarantee that what those folks are telling him is the right stuff\nPretty much guarantee that it's not well yeah in the ... not time to pass the baton yeah what\nWe were in power it's very hard to really push it and you know no it's not it's not the same man why do you limit it well I think it's a good idea but my point is we can be
