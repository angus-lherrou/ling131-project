I Wish I Wish I I was a nerd and I saw right apple you know I was I really watch as in band isn't science was in the physics\nClub you know what kind of killing a lot yeah but but you know honestly\nWhen when I was in\nHigh school you know it was like I was like Schroeder\nYou know for peanuts okay if I didn't stink and I'd have a dust cloud running around me but like lateral that girls didn't notice me\nAt all I don't see a ring now no no no I'm the happiest divorce man on the face of the year ... on the page I signed it so fast and I kept them and it's in my safe at all no rights to learn from this um but you know I have no no issues with uh with my actually my marriage lasted six\nUm but you know I have no no issues with uh with my ex wife my marriage lasted six months so I've got\nYou got to give it a chance right\nGod you know when I came home to buy a house at all or I was in my house for two and a half hours for I realized all her stuff was gone so you know that's\nThat's just the way it is but I Wish you the best cheese on husband number five now I was a number three much she likes getting married at the staying married she has a problem um anyway\nWe we started on a hundred different roads and Kerry was on here and she's she wrote back and it's obviously it's a it's a young lady and she said there shouldn't be any sexual limitations are there shouldn't be any statute of limitations on sexual assault\nBut there should be ramifications for the woman\nFor not bringing it up in a timely manner so you can't I'm Sorry carry but you can't have your cake and eat it too you either bring it up and actually or you let it go\nNow any woman that says that she didn't go to a high school party and maybe Carol Carol's gonna I Know Carroll's going to chew my behind for what I'm about to say but I don't\nThink there are very many high school aged girls that maybe how to boys boyfriend in high school senior or maybe they were juniors and they were dating the senior on the football team whatever that went to a party where there was drinking going on that things didn't get a little\nOut of hand and things may have gotten a little in hand you know we do use a different phrase ... but you can't take that that happened\nIn in my case Nineteen Seventy eight or Nineteen Seventy nine and then fast forward for almost forty years later and cost a man his family and his seat\nOn the highest court in the land first of all what he did drinking at a party maybe he got a little Frisbee with a young lady who was at the party to but that doesn't mean that he continued to do that kind of stupid immature act\nFor the rest of those thirty five years and develop a great law career and became a great judge and is now on the you know now they're looking at whether or not he can continue to seat sit on the Supreme Court in the state or he currently reside\nAnd you saw that ridiculous thing about the basketball court right St you shouldn't be on the same court with these girls how ridiculous and I truly founded amazing at how they were trying to deal with this alcohol and make it sound like he has some big alcohol problem I'm Sorry that this man had an alcohol problem\nI think in all actuality even though he has said that he\nThought there was precedence for Robie wait I think a big portion of this is because there are a lot of people scared that he's going to overturn abortion in this country of course\nWell let me just say that as a professional in the securities financial business\nIf I make new some stupid on my part I Can't go sue you because I have knowledge if I make a bad investment is just on me because I have a knowledge layer that the normal guy doesn't have and as a clinical psychologist I'd say the same thing she has no standing\nTo come in there and give me all this bunk and I went for an end crime and all this stuff in\nA heavy breathing and a barely talking in squeaking and all this stuff it just seems like it was studied a study thing\nI have no ... at it from my standpoint I have no standing if I tried to sue you because I made a bad investment\nI'm a knowledgeable investor according to the law so I have no standing to go in there and try to get my money back from you to see and I I think people need to understand we're dealing with this is not and they acted presented her as some housewife\nThat never has been out in the world or anything else I mean it was it was just totally ridiculous I mean it may I I got sick to my stomach watching it because it was just horrible stuff well\nJay thank you for your call tonight I appreciate it and uh I look forward to to to interacting with you here on on on this particular subject what it what do you think about what Jay says I\nThink that you need to realize that the senators are different than the lemon\nThose senators are so ... than I think they will do anything in their power to stop a trumpet plenty from getting on that court however\nThis one and she may be a Democrat all these things may be true about her but she does happen records from two thousand and twelve where she was ten kids about that I think that she was assaulted I just don't think he ... he ...\nI Believe and I think she spoke credibly in many ways there was one time she had a lot of knowledge that she should have had as a PHD in psychology but there was one question they\nAsked her that she should have known that that she wants to know where I Wish I could we call it off the top of my head and I thought if she has done enough research to know the ... she should have known the answer to that question also and she didn't but she has a legitimate protest or a woman\nShe had a trend terrifically traumatic experience but not much capital\nThe traumatic experience but not much capital\nIs it is it just the difference between men and women that make up the reason why we have traumatic things that happen to us when we're kids\nLawyers are soldiers come back and they have had some terrible trauma I just want to give a shout out there's a new coffee shop on main street social conscious and it was one of our soldiers who came back\nHis trauma from dean in Iraq was so awful that he ended up homeless\nBut he was able to pull himself back together and has now started a chain of coffee stores are ones that to become a chain so get out and support him if you can he's just at that new area that they're starting to develop on on main street\nBut this is a strong man and as I spoke with him I could see that it had to be so devastating\nFor him to have been in a position where his brain betrayed him like that\nYeah I I'm not a supporter of pie TST when just not that I'm there are a lot of things that happen to people and if you have a a significant level of testosterone you should be able to most of your way through it in other words just put on your big boy pants and and keep moving forward um we have think\nYou've had any ... underneath you have you\nAre no around me you might not under name underneath me though the age it I understand it it's easy for a woman to what we need to do is we as a nation we need to stop coddling people which rarely do we need to stop coddling\nPeople need to pull their weight right one of the problems we have in Jacksonville is we have part of our city that not only doesn't pull it's economically it doesn't contribute anything to the rest of the economic weight of the city and that's what ... is trying to do we\nWant the origin of that or the Jacksonville Jaguars I'm I'm not going there but you know I'm right I'm there we\nWe seat fifty thousand people are most in the stadium in a community a big community here that over a million people\nAnd if you include the listening area and the participation area of our of of you know the the St Augustine area and the Nassau County area and the lake city area\nWhere we get a much much bigger area of people that are affected by the jaguars but only forty to fifty thousand people get to take advantage of it 'cause the ticket prices are so high\nAnd so they can't go so we have forty to fifty thousand people that the rest of us are carrying on our backs with our taxes\nWith the money that the city council spans fourteen but can't even have the decency to win more than one season remembers all ... up about the number of wins they've got trust me I think they're still going to be below five hundred this year we haven't really anybody\nThough when we beat the patriots I thought oh this is our turnaround we are really going to do it this year man had an interesting thing he said he said today's the day the jaguars learned how to win\nAnd I thought that was true because then the second half as you saw we found down a little bit but we came back and we win that game however last week and went to that came in it is just the same team\nRight right but you know they are it's it's what you said again yes it's a game paying your electric bill is not a game paying your water bill buying tax for your car paying for insurance is not a game\nBut if we can get shot con to start to see that the way to really honored his players\nAnd honor his position he's in charge of followed this social justice stuff\nFor the NFL if we can get him to see that the way to truly do that well is to show that Jacksonville is the first city that has had\nA comprehensive coordinated operationally detailed strategically designed plan to change the near to the the inner city and it worked because everybody started pulling in the same direction we stopped\nHaving duplication of services when we don't need them we started getting services where we do need them we started supporting certain things that are important our new superintendent she needs our help big support we need for her Joe peppers over ... hope lines we need to get the money into the hands well\nLet me ask you this the New Year's new we have the Veterans Memorial arena yes which is sitting idle more days out of the year now than it did before we had the APA theater yes we spent in Ninety million dollars of which the city pony up forty five million\nThe city pony up forty five million at a vote of the city council as endorsed by the mayor and the mayor's administration because he wanted to make good ... Khan what would that forty five million dollars have done for your project\nNow they'll you know that's a very well with that forty five million dollars done for your project it\nWould make it so that I could take a neighborhood in Jacksonville and I could show that what we saw happen in Orlando with tangible little park could happen here and and interested we just had spent less money generally you know here's the reason he spent far less than forty five million for his neighbor\nAnd instead what we did is we spent money so that the elite of our community that can afford to pay anywhere from a hundred and twenty five dollars to almost eight hundred dollars a seat\nOr Ninety thousand dollars a season for a sky box can go and sit in the theater and listen to a country western band it could have been just as easily hurt and the Veterans Memorial coliseum let's go to the phones real quick\nAnd bring up Tammy on line to Tammy good evening or walking to the show Laurie you're on deck\nHi Tammy Hi Tammy Hi I just wanted to point out that there are in our history had their relationships between men and women than better\nWhen it's been under Judeo Christian principles and traditions and issue with that the doctor and judge\nKavanaugh things need to be a way to undermine exactly\nWhat he says for the fall asleep and I will say since I Love the politician and I'm not letting the organization is\nIs it really matters to redirect plan today and and all kinds of things that I'm really goes to what you're talking about bad side and organizations and by the end of how we interact with people with taxpayer dollars and\nJamie thank you for your call tonight I appreciate it more you're on deck will get too soon as we get back but like I said just keep that in mind when you started talking about things think about these large TVs which were the biggest\nTown for thirty one days until they bought bigger ones for the Daytona international speedway so did we really need those TVs or not you're listening and I was speaking funding will be\nRight you know she's already out there already falling asleep at at at at the state of the union address nobody thought to give this woman some coffee or maybe some uppers or something before she walked into the\nTo the Senate chambers that night anyway a little embarrassing and is is terribly embarrassing right she should have resigned it's like like Dan Marino should've resigned as quarterback three seasons before he finally quit Ginsburg needed to like\nGo off and write a memoir somewhere you know Twenty years ago but it may not\nTwenty but well I mean she is certainly overstayed hurt useful life part\nSo what I'm saying is\nYou watch mark my words I'm a stay at night that the next person that he puts up for the Supreme Court will be a woman probably Barrett or another woman that makes it through the vetting process\nI'd be willing to bet that because of social pressure not big causal qualification that woman might be African American the first African\nAmerican and he just awesome if they could find an African American woman who had that kind of experience and they aren't on that Supreme\nDead why won't care there won't be about she belongs there it'll be a bit about that will appease the most people see right now Brett Kavanaugh\nThe problem with him is not that he's Brett Kavanaugh it's not that he didn't make it white male that band that Trump hold on a chance to appoint before the midterm election\nWait a second it's more than that though it goes back to ideology you can be African American if you are conservative African American that is just considered a cardinal sin by a significant part of the liberal population and they will as we saw with the Kanye West you\nKnow they will go after their own because they will sit there and say how can you be how or why are you doing that they don't understand that it's possible to be African American and really understand that the conservative principles are best for all of us were all happy ...\nPrincipals don't give out the handouts that these people are used to getting that's why I keep coming back to this idea and I ...

to continue the conversation just because the doors are locked and you can't get out so\nThis book that you wrote it's effectively a commentary like when somebody says I don't know reading the Bible

did you get the idea\nTo start doing this for all of the New Testament because I just love it\nIt is so presumptuous when you think about it that I that I decided to do that that is so daunting and I don't mean that facetiously I mean who am I to be doing this uh\nYou know those people who know you are thinking exactly the same [laughter] thinking you know what I Know David and it just doesn't

just tell people to do stuff and they say oh I Can't do it in the end of the fact of the matter is if God has called you to do something you do it in obedience and you trust him with the results in the fact of the matter is that you\nHave a gift of communication I find interesting your your brother is it rust red ... rash also as a gift of communication and when you have a gift of communication which I I Am by God's Grace also have you want to use it to help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject\nUse it to help people and sometimes you can write a book on a on a subject people write books on subjects just like this book and it doesn't sing it doesn't speak it it's sort of the kind of thing that it's a it's an effort to get through it\nAnd uh your books and not that way and and I really am glad that you've taken the time to write them because we all need someone to hold her hand to walk us through the scriptures that is what this is\nYou know thank you and you know when I was in this position maybe I should this for I don't think I did but um\nI I feel like I'm I Wish I had someone when I was first hungry and learning I Wish there was a short cut I Want to consume I Want to inhale the Bible in the theological knowledge\nAnd and I don't know how to do it I I just grow up around and I kept finding I kind of did it the hard way get steady and things and I think I have I Do think I have a gift to discern where I can kinda tell what's out there and what's mainstream what's reliable side I think I've been blessed with that\nMuch access show I'm sitting here with David Limbaugh\nWho continues to write these marvelous books the new one is Jesus is ribs and Paul in the early church\nAnd and David my first question in the segment is what do you need to do this show for your friends with Sean Hannity he had you on the show and the book goes to number one so what what do you why you're wasting your time you should just be writing another book back home I mean do you live a ... journal Missouri You live in Missouri still I Love it here in Missouri man\nYes Sean's awesome great friend rush helps me mark well then they all helped me a and I've been blessed you have a unique perspective a unique styled interview and your cerebral you bring up things that nobody else that I don't know is this a pay that\nYeah that was just going to say I I'm I'm listening this is pretty good I better shut up\nBut I told I told Lauren that that's not my daughter Lauren with regular I told you that before this interview or a\nMale you know speaking of ... is the publisher of your book reading or he's also the publisher of my book\nIt's called Donald drain the swamp and I'll tell you something I spent months\nThinking about writing that book and I spent an afternoon writing that book and it is a fable and I think John is going to have me on his program to talk about that you'll see when you read it because it's actually a\nIt is so shallow that anybody can understand that but it's really stupid and it's really fun but ... is the publisher so we share a publisher we share a faith yeah uh we were both uh kids in Missouri actually that's not true I was in ... but we're both kids\nAnd here we are in the same room with what are the odds of this it's unbelievable in our early on his own credible okay so your book you were just going on to say that but the the figure in this book because it talks about paw Saint Paul in the early church\nThis takes us really from the gospels into act right yes so suddenly Jesus is crucified he is\nA resurrected from the dead forty days later he a sense to heaven and then everybody standing around thinking okay now what do we do like a he's gone he's resented into having we know we rose from the dead we many of us saw him we talked to him but\n... then we enter what's called the early church and that's what your book talks about is like weird did what happened in those years I'm forty BC fifty bc as Paul and Peter and the other apostles kind of fan out through the early world I'm a ... of that day um\nAnd we're at the point where you said Paul this incredible prosecutor Christians is on a horse on his way to Damascus he's causing a lot of trouble people are scared to death of this guy yeah [noise]\nAnd he's blinded by the light knocked off of his horse and basically has the ultimate conversion experience\nYes by the way you said forty BC did you\nMean eighty we've got to make sure the readers don't never correct me and my radio show yeah sorry uh somebody that I'm Sorry forty eight the ladies and gentlemen and no dummy there you know you're the lord okay and so yeah\nYeah so So Paul ... is one of the greatest apologetic moments or evidence is that Paul who is this a persecuted ardent believer of art in this waiver Christianity becomes the greatest convert and Christ commission seemed to be the apostle to the gym tiles\nAnd the Gen tells me be non Jews and non Jews and yeah it is are they call them in the Bible Greeks can you relate to that you know isn't that interesting it is they they like gravel limit Greeks he's thing and and it says but no it says in Christ there's neither Jew ... nor Greek gifts but only lithuanians [laughter] and\nThat's a lotta manuscripts who look into it and that but isn't that interesting that that\nPaul was appointed specifically\nTo speak to those outside of of the Jewish community now daddy doesn't mean that he didn't speak to people in the Jewish community to convince them that Jesus as much time but he was specially commission to go to those who were not part of the Jewish community who did not go to synagogue and they say to them oh by the way\nThe God that we Jews have worshiped is now available to you through Jesus and God chose the Jewish people to bring a faith in him to the whole world and now the time has come that everybody\nBeyond the world of of\nWell world and now the time has come that everybody beyond the world of of the Jews Kimball leaving the God of the Jews through Jesus he's the bridge and the time is now I mean it's it's pretty amazing\nPretty amazing and and also amazing as told in this book which is about the Bible\nThat Paul always retained his heart for the Jews for his people and he tries tries to convince them of the authenticity of this message in of Jesus Christ that he is really the messiah and in fact the book of Romans\nIn part as a lament he's suffering so much agony over the idea that he can't convince so many of his Jewish brothers that Christ is the ...\nAnd and he talks about ultimately Jews coming around by the way I don't want to offend any do I believe that\nWe believe that Christ is the fulfillment of the Old Testament and not the abolition of it or not the evolution of the old cabinet but the fulfillment of it and it the New Testament of a continuation of the Old Testament completes the picture\nBut I think that Christians authentic Christians have a heart for Jews and we don't we everybody at the same under Christ and you just said there's no great there's no ... ... everybody is offered this gift of salvation [noise] uh and\nPaul is you see the agony as he writes\nOr to the early churches who we're deviating from the message\nAnd you see what a raw human being he is\nAnd he and he was writing just like it's today because of human beings and human nature hasn't changed in two thousand years\nWe're falling people made in God's image which is another paradox and yet fall\nAnd Paul rights and pleased with these churches that he found that he feels like there but he gave birth to them in a literal sense and that his kids are going off the path and he wants to bring 'em back\nIn a disciplinary sense to the true word of God not for his benefit but for their ... and they also will become ambassadors to other Christians and and producers and multiples in that sense throughout the Roman empire and throughout the world in history and so this is a story these officials\nPause writing these people like the same problems we've ... experience today\nThey're they're they've got falls teachers coming in their ... puffed up on their own false stories trying to build their own ego or maybe maybe demonic Lee inspired to get people off the gospel\nBut and they're ... they're in disarming in their churches there\nThey're making a mockery of the lord supper and fighting and east tell given a practical advice practical mundane advice to how they get back\nTo the spiritual practices and then he's also in getting very lofty as to Christian doctrine and he this is preserved these weren't scripture when he wrote them and they were but nobody knew it in their ... their letters to individual churches are individuals\nAnd now they are preserved by God's Providence to become letters for all Christians so that we can be added\nIsn't is amazing I mean I I always want safe because I Know there's somebody out there listening who doesn't know when Christians talk about the book of Romans ... whatever what do we mean by that what we mean is that this man Paul\nUh is traveling around the ancient world\nCreating churches creating Jesus a bull believer groups here and here and hearing here but then he keeps traveling and the only way you can communicate with them is to write these letters so he hears things from them they write letters to him\nAnd the letters that he wrote to them we can just imagine what's going through his mind he is not just like oh let me just down a few notes he's thinking this is this may be the only thing I get to say to this group of people so he takes tremendous pains\nTo school them in doctrine what's right what's wrong so there's all kinds of the logical stuff in there and then as you said there's practical stuff 'cause he hears about arguments about communion or this or that\nAnd he puts it all down not knowing that this would become a part of the Bible it's a it's kind of an amazing\nThing it's an amazing thing in another parallel thing it's grounded in actual history just like the entirety of Christianity is grounded in the history of Jesus as bodily resurrection\nHere's Paul not writing some abstract theological doctrine\nThat's untethered to real historical events he's living this experience and under the Holy Spirit empowerment he's writing these letters to the church that are that are steeped in practical advice in doctrine not knowing that they're only going to be available to us pray in a transcendent way\nHow cool is that I was going to really that's what's so cool is that when you say in a transcendent away when he was writing them as you're saying he didn't understand that they would become scripture for everybody that I'm just writing to the specific group of people either in Rome or in a colossus or in a ... show or one of these places he's writing to them\nBut the way he wrote God used it\nTo reach Christians for ever and ever and ever it becomes the word of God\nAnd uh I I Do think that that's such a beautiful thing because\nIt transcends time I mean it exist in time as a piece of history and yet it transcends time because guess what it is the word of God before we go to the break I Want to remind you folks this week only we have a two for one sale going on if you give\nTo alliance

hair to ... so I feel like I really really went in it and it was almost a rite of passage for me to watch people go through this but everyone's experience was completely different that something that was really interesting to scare actors basically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read\nTo see if they're going to be more afraid you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag and put over her head she was rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then that guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience is different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times one recently the event concluded with him stripped of his boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw and simulated body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was at and you know it was interesting because this took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they weren't blindfolded they were led to this dusty\nRV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress base here and they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting blood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this fits in body voice that was super creepy that was walking him through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere as they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog and this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and start rationing them around and rich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear\nAnd is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest and yeah so the majority of these protests against it ended up in the fetal position in their underwear and\nWhat was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking wow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules that these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people on and the guys were kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred them\nBut you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like universal studios times and you know they pop out and I think are a lot of them having no touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck but\nThey're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward they're all about it\nThis weekend's Jim ... with New York times

create special times with friends and families you said maybe a sporting event or are going to the theater dinner out with friends but in some circles I could see where that would be considered frivolous spending money you should put in your pocket\nYeah there are all kinds of spending that that other people think it's for less than I think it was a while but it's really goes back to the previous point about experience it you know the research tells us that\nExperiences deliver more happiness than possessions and one of the reasons that experiences to live a more happiness is because
