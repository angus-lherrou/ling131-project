the front in red white and blue and one's sleeve was a red and white stripes the flag the other sleep was the blue and the stars of the flag\nOn the back it had his name like a Jersey what habit says Trump forty five was the number for him being a forty fifth president\nNow the reason why he was wearing the shirt to the football game in high school football game is because he was participating in the usa America night\n\nOr the principal solve the back of his shirt and kicked him out because the shirt quote offended someone\nYeah but definitely not a mob mentality\nYou got to high school kid where's this shirt that says Trump forty five on the back\nLooks like a Jersey where the usa on the front and the and the torch being held\nOf the statue of liberty and the principal kick them out of the game he understands comes and find them in the stands because someone who was offended and you don't want me to believe that there's a mob mentality against conservatives by the left in this country come on\n\nThis is what they do to silence high school kids\n\nYou know kind of a west today said in the oval office illegal guns or not or the problem\n... ... illegal guns are the problem not legal guns we have the right to bear arms and was the last say they say the president is taking advantage of a black man a token black man\n\nWho clearly has mental health issues\nShaming Kanye

would think actually a meeting between the president Kanye West your browser by the way it was said or blacks really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry is comment

a lot of that sentiment has what gave him the balls to go for it and make so much money do they need us I'm just stunned across the board you\nKnow we're going to have a good I thought they were to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in part on criminal justice reform sentencing and prisons which is by the way a bipartisan really important idea of there was that was mostly nonsense\nThat was mostly nonsense 'cause that man a black man was conservative\n\nThat was an assault on our White House\nImmediately after ... anyway us and the ...

and I think that we're winning we're actually winning that's why the left is going ... that's why the\nThe mainstream media is going bonkers as they called him because they know that if we get just a few percentage points more\nOf the black vote it's over for him it doesn't matter ... they can say whatever they want to say they can keep pushing that that racist talking point that the Republicans are racist people like myself are waking up and I'll tell you something bad I'm thirty three years old I was born and raised a lifelong Democrat\nI was a liberal I was an idiot okay I ate up all of that crap\nThat they fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get ahead that I Would never be treated equally I never felt more ... than when I went to south haven Mississippi and I went to a Trump rally and I wore that make America great again hat and I totally\nYour own home now you need to go to a mental hospital you need to go to a mental hospital run away\nRight well I'll tell you what you know what a mental hospital is better than the Democrat plantation and you know what they look how quickly they turn on you when you don't agree with what they say and the sad thing about it is is that ... ... settlers what's really sad is he's ...\nHe's the person that they put up there to lie to all of us are there but oh\nOh I Know I I think I think he's a leader in the Democratic party because he's able to marginalize into black people that they can't you can't disagree with the Democratic party or you are going to be an Uncle Tom and you're not going to be accepted in your communities you're not going to be accepted in your church are not going to accept your neighborhoods\nBut Ben I'm Talking to more and more black people and getting\nOut there and I'm saying

marvel at it in that you know are are telling the truth but for the most part\nYou know they're they're bought and paid and they're on their their brainwashing people twenty four hours a day and in

Democrat city black people have got to wake up they don't wake up and say well if there isn't for us to continue to vote for one party and makes no sense on planet earth when that party has done nothing for your school system is done nothing for the prison system it's done nothing for father's\nThe lack of fathers and the home the welfare state and\nAnd people are that eventually wake up and

about\nThis for a moment George Bush doesn't like black people if we take a look at prosperity and the unemployment rate rock above a hated black people that go to Donald Trump Donald Trump loves black people\nI mean human county there man\nHe loves them and you know who else Donald Trump loves Donald Trump gloves women you know George Bush I liked woman we take all get unemployment rate that go to the economy I think he likes women's\nBracket bomber well sure I I I think I I don't think brought to bomb a like to women\nBut Donald Trump Donald Trump gloves women\nI'm Still talking about the economy and unemployment rates have spry mud in for Marco then but something about the things real quick or this is kind of important in the context of these conversations while the media wants to make it all about how much\nThe profanity of Kanye West what is costing you pointed out\nAt least pointed out\nThat uh hey you know from an economic standpoint what's most important it's important that people are lifted up that they have opportunity oh okay so where have we had the most opportunity for black adults will shoot that's Donald Trump\nHere or all of the demographics\nThat are experiencing record low unemployment rates this year\nYes black adults women Hispanics\nBorn adults and even Native Americans and in fact if we weren't going to find a girl\nThat Donald Trump doesn't like the Donald Trump doesn't love apparently Donald Trump doesn't like why people\nGeorge Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people think about the only place well a record low I Want to blame the rates right now huh how that happened now\nBeing that you are probably more ... than the average person out there you know how the game has always been played\nDemocrat politics are what their identity politics they're meant to divide their mental cause friction division their men also importantly to do what keep people down\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their minds remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people door open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nFor open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults both for Democrats now\nWhen it with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is it\nThat for decades how we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus of time for a Democrat no open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics\nBut nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poorest neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that\nIs where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity and the one thing if we take a look at George W. Bush administration\nAt the politics of usually as usual at that time we didn't see the inner cities being lifted up what Donald Trump brought us what any campaign on the inner cities weren't going to let them up\nMinority unemployment rate it's real it's happening George Bush might not have like five people but Donald Trump\nFly people telling us settled drop by mud ever the gray one mark a little bit\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it mean to to lead for\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is ...\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is force Hillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep all my government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nBut what do you say\nYou see somebody like cotton yang who obviously is not an ideologue got here was not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man\nHe did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adults is in double digits all the sudden\nThat could be enough that could be enough\nLet's go to Nancy in Indiana Nancy

require down the street that we're going to pull you over I recorded that it's still a caption or you can hear them call me you're not allowed to bring those tapes down with a quick track\nAnd you have to call me or you've been with South Carolina to New Jersey\nAnd when the court said a cargo backdrop for Brazil order if I could Sam and we're in the county six months I'm like I said I'm sitting here it's like\nI Want to Chicago I Would you want us to hospital will give you a little contract guy trying to ... pounds and pushing come into my brain that's a contract\nTo settle this is an interesting they you know it's kind of like a ... if the euro west of the Rockies\nDial a but I I Will and will take a look done uh and and I\nDo wish you well under the sun is Gil morality I I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we're talking about the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around a a three and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey uh you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality throw it away if you missed it at the onto the show it's kind of my theme that I'm tiny things into today\nI like to say there are two sides to stories one side effects and you had the premise of the premise of anything is faulty built upon it will fail to but they're also was a sliding scale of morality in similar on it\nWe exist and where we're at our best maybe we're good people when we're at our worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well and\nA lot of that happen through misinformation\nSo let's talk about\nThe employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack unemployment rate at all time lapse\nAnd somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and\nSomething constructive came out of it now you have gone yeah west who goes into the oval office and something constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture or minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds\nEqual better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and to people that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believed her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you had people that started out in that sliding scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken whole minority communities including black adults women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before bats that shade and change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man but and the grand scheme of sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years than Batman that always told me that the there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says something you can pretty much take it to the bank I'm

president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we noted takeaway benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer health care system better than aids all private employer based health care plans it would cost an astonishing thirty two point six trillion during its first ten years\nOh by the way as a candidate\nI promised that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new healthcare insurance option that will lower premiums I've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down I've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare\nThat's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of vista right Medicare\nDemocrats have already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare what their plan government takeover of American healthcare ended the extra there for the president let me\nPut something in very clear terms\nThe president could not be more right\nThe omission and the media on this one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible\nBut what the president is doing here\nIs an education that you can even get in school right now it's so important the greatest fraud the greatest fraud that has ever been perpetuated and accepted as the legitimate concept by millions of Americans as Medicare for all\nIs significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are

entertaining and has a ... we'll see where that story ends\nNow\nA a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one bad has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about but the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increased to Fifteen dollars per hour which ended up itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the puck proceeded to talk about the ... the on the left or knows no bounds remember a once upon a time\nWal Mart was the greatest the pool and the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were putting a bunch of people on minimum wage right plus at Walmart\nThere from uh from Republican place aren't they had their those people so I mean for all those reasons I mean Wal Mart was just a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got to Amazon dot com they happen to be brighter than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent the size and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left\nBut again you know I I began begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress where Amazon goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the the post go\nEverybody should take Amazon's model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people to understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business there were getting crushed by Amazon ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\nA ... they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually checked my research on this and ironically enough the last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the Occupy\nCrowd and the twenty fourteen mid term elections happened to be about four years ago that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what a lot of folks in the country had a point because they did kind of thought you know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay but\nEven then what percentage of people earned\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even ... bombers the God I mean it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a half but it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was them and we've got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage you're reading according to the bureau of Labor Statistics\nPoint six percent\nPoint six percent that zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage conversation\nCome up again ah one of the great frauds perpetuated that's out there are still living wage it's funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com profits prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little\nBe able to increase wages just like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's banking not only are we finally\nJust about three percent charged a wage growth but to me out and bought it just goes over that by the time you add in your tax cuts churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay now up six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good [noise] so [noise] living wage\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy wage and the minimum wage it's just a bunch of BS killing Medicare for all suicides histories one side of the facts will continue to do a lot more\nThe factual stuff right here I Am Brian ... and for the great one Marshall them\n\nEvery time you go

creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nEmploy but [noise] you know\nI I guess conveniently bad bet message has just been missed you know I I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC when one of their news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nAh one of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nOr are we doing all good [laughter] well\nI see it as kind of a two part problem really I mean you get a single payer health care system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospital in business for smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it all because they can't cut the cost\nThat the government wants to cut them down to you for a lot of this stuff\nThat the first part I see\nThe second part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospitals you know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand feet of sea bag of fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the members right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital\nAnd a lot more than ... hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the ... you have a and a good point but I ... a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about\nInsurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability in health care is health insurance\nProblem is we had been raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance is was according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the all an average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off if you had eighty five hundred dollars that you could use on health care or would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars\nOn health care or would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars with for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit a deductible which often happens to be a high deductible\nPlan which state and you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care that's all part of the financial fraud so the number one way\nTo get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most back crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says in so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nOnce you have no clue generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which Spain generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for once they also can't tell you you'll pay for\nHow crazy is that you won't Magid walking into a store build a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing a piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this\nIs back crap crazy\nBut that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use insurance for everything else in our life how was that well what we do if we have no mechanical problem with our car well we we do pay inhabits asked\nIf we get in a big time accident we found this year and clay or already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying it's the worst thing that's essentially what they are catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer\nWe\nConsumers when we have an opportunity to shop oh we got on the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at best\nDeal boom done but with health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it on the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look anytime we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars come to the point there\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper those as something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans will continue the conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one
