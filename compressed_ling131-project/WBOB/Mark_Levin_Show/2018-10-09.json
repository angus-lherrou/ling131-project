you my experience of why this is so dangerous when I was a federal agent why this matters so much when when I was running a fraud cases in the New York office or in the Melville office in New York when I was with the secret service\nIf it was a small ... case remember treasury checked most but a lot of people still get 'em your tax refund you'll get a treasury check recalled teach at cases what would happen a lot with these ... they were really boring cases it'd be candid with you\nBut these ... cases would be say you were getting a tax refund and you know it's made and you're not you know get your check and they would call and the IRS would say well we mail that three weeks ago well what do you think happened folks they got stolen that they did the check got stolen someone signed didn't stole it that simple as that ... we hated those cases why do I tell you any of it\nBecause once in awhile if the case wasn't worked at a quick enough speed\nIt constituent would call the

equally I'm not here to lie to you know I'm here to give you the truth\nThose cases would get a handle by the book because they you know was a congressman goal and they add a big care of it but they would always be by the numbers what's so deeply\nDisturbing about Spygate case if the guy was running for president United States Donald Trump president of the United states and instead of handling it\nBy the book hey we're going to look at this information where it came from\nWe're going to run down all of these leads\nWe're going to make sure these leads are legitimate this dot CA before we do

cannot be civil war the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for says Hillary in a tweet that to me means it's time to declare civil on civil war with the Democrats which is what the Trump or did it did so well and let's put some of this in context\nAbout two or three days ago Republican Sen Cory Gardner of Colorado on Sunday a couple of days ago said his wife received his wife received a graphic text message with a video depicting up at ... at the gardener voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh's record on Saturday thousands of demonstrators bought and paid for\nBy George Soros

theft or personal information all kinds of crimes felonies when\nHe a one on line and released private information about three senators sitting on the Judiciary Committee that being Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIncluding home addresses or their personal cell phone numbers and of course Jackson Costco was a show called an unpaid intern working for

Democrats look extreme and vicious second the whole Kevin I'll Fight United Republicans more than ever before was even some skeptics appreciating his strong defense of a good man and outstanding judge\nThird the Democrats implacable an irrational hysteria towards Kevin ... shows that Trump's not the only one to blame for our president polarization the president may be rude and crude\nBut even

reporting on the wall Street Journal this was\nFrom August of this year for the wall Street Journal the daily diary of the American dream\nIs to Portland, Oregon a mob surround an ice officers in southwest Portland June nineteenth they barricaded the exits blocked the driveway they saying quote guards unquote to patrol the doors working for antifa trapping federal workers inside\nAt night they laid on the street to prostate stopping traffic at a critical junction near a hospital\nPolice stayed away under the orders of the idiotic mayor Ted Wheeler\nBut this time I'm denying your requests for additional resources so the mayor the Portland police bureau is deputy chief Robert de wrote to federal officials under direction of the mayor Ted Winkler dumped sorry Ted Wheeler who's a real clown\nAnd so the federal workers were locked inside the federal building goes in ... for a few hundred protesters would not permit ice or other federal agencies to operate inside a federal building\nHours later the remaining ice workers were finally evacuated by a small federal police team the facilities shut down for more than a week they couldn't function\nComplete rampant mob violence in Portland, Oregon which is similar to what's happening in San Francisco and other cities but now the protesters in Portland Ore back on the streets blocking traffic have you seen the video several dozen\nOr in a particularly disturbing video protesters takeover intersections stopped traffic braiding harass older white men in cars who refused to obey their traffic directions Portland police under the idiotic leadership of mayor Ted Wheeler do nothing\nThey yell at these older white men you're a little white supremacist go back to the south know KKK here et cetera\nIn one video protesters smashed an older white man Sudan with baseball bats after he makes a turn against their wishes they've taken over the streets shouting who streets our streets\nAfter the drivers zipped down the street to get away from them they chased after and for some reason he stopped it out of his car to inspect the damage in his car with guns can administer more damage he got back in his car quickly ahead of the mob and left\nThis emerging brand of called St anarchy has lost money asking Portland married Ted Wheeler to regain control of the city which he refuses\nTo do much flipped a script what if some city maybe in the south a whole bunch of white supremacist were pulling black people out of their cars and beating the hell out of them are damaging their property taken over the streets yelling who's straight to our streets what the hell would happen\nAll hell breaks loose what had happened in Charlottesville which was a terrible deed committed upon that woman who was killed the person responsible was subjected to federal hate crime legislation a ... I'm Sorry indictment plus arrest and he should have been killed somebody\nAnd that was roundly condemned this violence is going to lead the shootings oh wait a minute I forgot\nSteve's college don't Louisiana was shot and almost killed by a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to kill Republican congressman chased out of restaurants in the elevators on streets in in airports the left as mobs they've been ... and all their supporters are doing exactly what Hillary Clinton\nAnd what the Democratic Party wants done are they over playing their hands\nFor weeks from today from tonight for

through that noise we work with you to really understand your needs and the dress those needs with the right solution no more\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story of Christian afford improve that she was either ... or a liar or boats\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nAnd so when this has happened is that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating allies against Brett Kavanaugh of the answer is not just know the answers hell no they're going to continue\nA tactical along though what they do that and that's the part that is absolutely mind boggling [noise] you know it's like\nIt it just doesn't seem like there's any ethics left any non where where in the cage at what point do you stand up with some kind of ethical value go this is wrong cordless by\nThe way you know what's going on here is that it's a constant fight it kind of began with pork\nAnd then it continue to Clarence Thomas a little bit of Alito his wife cried had to leave the room with Alito Democrats students that Republicans but even Elena Kagan made several misstatements nobody talked about perjury nobody talks about impeachment Lindsey Graham voted for Sotomayor he voted for Reagan\nDemocrats due to the Republicans but Republicans have too much character to do it to the Democrats when there was an odd the writers' strike at Charlottesville that does something wrong\nAnd those clouds those fools if you're a white guy marching around a southern city with tiki torches yelling about Jews then you're a clown in Europe full we can't have that in this country and it happens on occasion\nBut the constant drumbeat from the left whether it's Portland or San Francisco or antifa or whether it's the Democrats in Congress or whether it's those in restaurants in elevators the chase down the Republicans it's happening ten times more often with Democrats than what the Republicans but\nI guarantee a John the media will not cover it that way the media coverage Charlottesville and they should have coverage Charlottesville why take covering one in ... is doing in Portland, Oregon that's what I Want one of the cover that\nBecause it doesn't but\nHow 'bout Siemens ... gone down how about a democratic hunting and gunning down a Republican warning that killed dozens and it was one day story and they stopped the Stevens Kelly's story after one day if a a someone wearing a mega had\nHad done that to a Democrat they would have followed that Democrats for months to talk about the daily struggles that Democrats had the violence committed by Republican but when Steven segal Eastwood shot down like a dog\nAt a baseball practice was one or two days story because it didn't fit the narrative the media dropped it like a hot potato\n\nI held on my bicycle a journalism major got roast is the biggest thing pushed out everybody at a ... on the high school is a Thirty Years' was out to be\nUnbiased I just thought that sticks in my life like the\nConcept and and most journalistic circles

Kaiser what's their girlfriend or Christina Ford\nWho gave a sworn statement that I don't recall the event Christina never talked about it in high school we've been friends for like thirty seven thirty seven years she's never mentioned it to me labeling Kaiser was the name given to the authorities by Cristina forward is somebody who would confirmed what happened on that day\nA former FBI agent\nContacted Leland Kaiser girlfriend or Christina forward and try to get her to flip and to refute and to repudiate her sworn statement that so far I guarantee you this John if Leyland Kaiser the female friend Christina Ford had not given a quick affidavit that said\nThat didn't happen and if that FBI agent had slipped labeling Kaiser and Leland Kaiser it said well Christina forward told me on that day what had happened and that bedroom with a mark judge Brett Kavanaugh if that had happened\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh would not be in the U.S Supreme Court because Susan Collins hunger hat\nOn the fact that the witnesses provided by the so called victim to knock him from what she said and they tried every way possible to find dirt on Brett Kavanaugh any such a boy scout they couldn't find anything and at the end of day they collapsed\nAnd I think the president last night your president your commander in chief and my president did a fabulous job telling the country exactly how he felt
