eyes yeah him anyway during the program off your mouth out of a cabinet when you least expect it\nNow [noise] and I are always very much actually\nPay their so today is uh uh I think It's Wednesday October third and you know what that means don't you yes it means that tomorrow\nThursday October for are you tracking a tomorrow is very important day and to discuss tomorrow I have my friend Jim daily president of focus on the family on the line Jim daily walk on the program Derek it's great to be with you has the big apple the big apple a\nTerrific uh it's where I live on the great place to visit even though there is not unusual in this place who you know I I actually love living here in all seriousness people I think visit New York get a very false view of New York because he can do tours de things and you go to where it's crowded\nIf you live here you don't do that but anyway uh I I Want to ask you about to Mars Mars a big day and I and we only have a few minutes but I'm excited to to tell the world about this I'll let you do it\nYeah bring your Bible to school or something we started the four years ago this is the fifth year and we started the first year eight thousand students participated\nLast year over five hundred thousand students participate in this year we hope seven hundred and fifty thousand will participate and it's real simple concept it allows and encourages\nA elementary school junior high and high school leaving college kids to bring their Bible to school and to share it with their friends at free time anytime other than class time\nIt's completely legal for kids to talk about the Bible bringing the Bible read the book of John at lunch all those things will be happening tomorrow or in the tens if not hundreds of thousands well\nI Love this idea this is exactly the kind of thing that I think we need to be doing more\nThe idea this is exactly the kind of thing that I think we need to be doing more of so and I congratulate you Jim\nOn this we need to understand that first of all uh the ability to do this is legal guaranteed by the constitution\nAnd the idea that people have a very false idea of the separation of church and state they they kind of think that means I Can't live my faith out in the public sphere that is absolutely not true and I suspect it's one of the reasons behind this idea of bringing your Bible to school tomorrow\nWell it is and if you think about it one of the problems we have and are free country is that we don't exercise these muscles one is religious expression and when we don't exercise that freedom it fees\nAnd I think that's one of the great things about this is encouraging kids who are Christians\nTo go to school and bring their Bible and what happens ultimately Eric is that school administrators are teachers will come to that\nThirteen fourteen year old little girl or a boy and say wait a minute you have that on your desk it's illegal and they'll pull out of one sheet that's been prepared for us by alliance defending freedom ATF illegal group\nAnd it's a one sheet that that says no students absolutely have this constitutional rights in typically that school administrators that teacher will read that and the students can download it at the website or bring your Bible dot org\nAnd they'll read that and say oh okay it looks like you're trying to do that but the fact that our at our school administrators and teachers don't even understand these rights as a little breathtaking they well\nUh it's breathtaking in its disturbing and only if we do\nThis tomorrow or are we helping them understand it and I think you know it's very tempting\nUh when somebody comes everyone says you can't hold that you can't have that Bible here in class to beat them about the head with the with the book itself and that is not what God calls us to do when joint to love our enemies to pray for enemies not to beat them about the head but if you're tempted to do that\nYou're only human I have to say it's very tempting because when when people do stuff like that you want to swat them about the head with a book and you wind\nUp getting sick book like the mind but I Want I Want to say don't do that I'm an ... don't do that or if you do it and make sure you repent and apologized but um [noise] it is important that we educate a\nOf the Clinton investigation and he's on the line right now judge Ken Starr welcome back\nThat area so good to be back with you thank you\nWell I I really think it's a monumental thing that you've written this book and it rises to the level of history because you were there\nAre only you can tell the story the way you tell it or in this book it's like Churchill writing about World War two you were a a very central figure\nA central figure as you can be without being Bill Clinton uh and and you really um [noise] I mean I think you voted to history or to put down your version of events I'm so glad you found the time to do this what in here will we read a that we might find surprising\n[noise] one of the most surprising things is to people who do all my work you came closest seeking died with Hillary Clinton\nCooper stunned by that because the popular narrative corrosive culture is a many supporters to this day is this was just about a bill and bill at Arkansas nobody got hurt at cetera as there was nothing gear and this after\nTrying to find something there where there was nothing bigger than ... built into this private militia up so that's the that's the meta narrative\nCompletely wrong and knowingly false fourteen criminal convictions that are in the fall I Hope that I Would be out there are six months I didn't want the job that doesn't apply for the job but\nI was asked by the three judge court to do the shop but in the fullness of time during the Lewinsky phase of the investigation\nThe Nineteen Ninety eight before the grand jury's life expired in Little Rock\nWe sat around the table in Washington DC and we carefully reviewed a draft indictment very thoroughly thriller\nOf Rodham Clinton which was supported by very detailed elaborate prosecution memorandum we call it a ... and then we had a thorough discussion and what we concluded was why we believe she had committed crimes in the Little Rock face of the investigation\nThat we simply did not have admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nThat she had committed those federal crops yeah that's a great protection for we the people prosecutors should not bring indictments unless they can clue what it is a luxury and so\nThe book will count some very interesting episodes including the destruction of documents that Madison guarantee savings and loan which in fact some court the Clintons financially and the whitewater adjustment which was ill fated it did in fact lose money\nTo the American taxpayer was that the financing of whitewater\nJames and Susan McDougal names in the past and bill and Hillary Clinton were the four partners whether federal crimes in connection with that long we believe that there was we simply could not find the documentation to prove the Clintons knowledge of it we had I Witness testimony\nBut does that sound familiar to the cabin always the I ... this testimony was not supportive\nRight by other evidence documentary or otherwise\nWell I guess this kind of um underscores my feeling about the ... ... they were so used to power and that they were corrupted by it in other words if you're very very smart or in a place like Arkansas you can get away with stuff\nAnd it seems that they did ended it began a pattern um which I think made them cynical toward um the populace that that when you treat people that way when you think of them as\nThey maybe they're there for you you're not there for them um it's it's it's a very unhealthy weight to start public life and it did become a pattern\nKid and one of the things that I think helps unraveled the mystery of what makes Hillary checked a\nComeback to bill but\nShe was very influence on was standing her having grown up and I conservative a traditional Midwestern household she goes off to college there's less of this or you send your sons or daughters to Baylor [laughter] she goes off to Wellesley obviously if\nWe're now the academic institution but there she comes under the intellectual ... people I tell the story\nRules for radicals and she did her senior honor's thesis on solids gain rules for radicals in the water the rules radicals who said that\nI wouldn't want to particularly to focus on a book I won't need to be aware of it right to be inform but to junior senior thesis on it you know not to take it apart and solving skills as your job and she decided I chose the steroid\nI better not work for this radical guy but one of his first rules is essentially destroy the other side not plus for\nCompassionate Christian it'll it'll let let's work collaboratively together come LBJ used to say quoting from the ... come\nLet us reason together no it's destroy all the other side and and she was quite vicious uh and as I say in the book but I've been criticized for this but uh that's that's my view I think she systematically enabled what Bill Clinton did\nIncluding just listen to the testimony as we talked about yesterday of Juanita Broderick at her interactions with Hillary we think Hillary knew what Bill Clinton had done\nTo a ... a Juanita Broderick as she says I was forcibly rate now I just I kept can barely get my mind around that the person that at a personal moral level as a Christian we also and fall short of God but this is a little bit much\nRules for radicals you get power you've got to find and get on the road to power and then you do whatever's necessary to maintain power once you have it\nWell if you think about it it makes perfect sense if you don't have a biblical view the universe if you don't believe in right and wrong you don't believe that you're answering to a higher power then life is what you make of it and if you can amass power for your ends who wouldn't do it right and these are people who are eminently capable of doing that now\nHe needs to be said you know you said that a\nHillary Clinton as a young woman\nAt Wellesley she wrote her senior thesis on song ... rules for radicals and it needs to be said that a roofer radicals this is not a joke for my audience I'm not making this up to ... his\nRules for radicals dedicated he is dedicated to\n... for that is the most chilling thing I think I have ever read on a book page when I read the dedication of rules for radicals and it's\nA it's a fundamental idea of the universe that says rebellion winning these are the things that matter the transcendent love of God and the love of truth and those things by definition go out the window so in a funny way it makes Machiavelli a you know look almost folksy\n[noise] there were clearly demonic forces or at or you know we're joined by scripture to fully for very appearance of evil and here's an evil and why he did it in a book a that is dedicated to the dark powers\nAre and why would one wants to do anything other than just be aware of it so you can carry on\nA carry on a carry on a intelligent conversation to give a reason for the hope that it is with us but why would you put your thesis on those and this set out to achieve power and ... they were very successful\nAt achieving power including by demonizing vilified\nBy other enemies I mean there's a certain amount of that in politics that I understand that turning the other cheek and according to the surround them out there is a little hard in politics but it has been done [laughter]\nIt can be done and and I think they should have done better Hillary would have done better in terms of our moral and that's much will develop much if she is the daughter of the land of Lincoln that focus on the Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural rather than the by both dedicated to uh to lose it for\nSo then you really do think it it did former going forward this was not just a an incidental moment a in her early life but then it somehow did shape per going forward as an activist\n[noise] I I was very though judge Judy and judge but the evidence certainly points overwhelmingly in that direction and one of the things that I described never upper estimate the opposition variety that he was\nSo everybody's talked at the end in school or in the army is and so forth you're not a underestimate the other side when you go into a debate you better be prepared et cetera et cetera [noise] so um\n[noise] I think what we may have done the American people made it does\nIs fail to do their homework to look at inside this person as best they can given the objective evidence and then why would a major party the party of Jefferson Jackson of FDR why would that party have\n\n...

investigation just have to ask you\nA when recently or in the election um uh between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump we we found out that uh she had done you know many a\nSeemingly illegal things as secretary of state they did it did he grieve you that she continued this this pattern I mean when you hear\nA you know talk of of smashing blackberries with cameras and things do you think\nThis is a bad movie and yet this seems to be what happened how can how I guess how can it be that somebody this smart as Hillary Clinton we continue this pattern of this kind of thing I I just wonder what how do you think that happened\nAt one level it is baffling because ... percent are rational person thinks hey you know I did something that will lead to a steak let's leave legality aside you know I'm gonna try to do better I'm going to try not to make that kind of mistake again but\nHere we see this pattern while I'm above the law the regulations don't apply and one of the house to pause and ...\nRegulations don't apply and one of the house to pause and say\nWait the person is a ... year [laughter] that applies to every one of us who you know we have to stop at stop signs or you know you get a ticket or so is it about this mentality that says well I can continue\nTo do the way I Want to do it in my ... so that who knows what the specific motivation was pleasant foundation kinds of issues with here once again there\nAre checks and balances is one of the messages in the book and I hope it's a message of hope for the American people we're seeing still unfold\nWay of example the inspector general Custer Portland taking a closer look at some of the things that have happened Ciruli condemning um Andrew McCabe who is no longer fired from the beyond the matter in ...\nTurned over to the criminal division of the Justice Department for possible uh investigation and so I think when all is said and done through the next inspector general report in terms of the Clinton Foundation investigation and so forth I think we're going to know a lot going on\nI'm impatient [laughter] we want to know now we wish the intelligence committees would get their work done and get the documents that they need to report to the American people but\nI just say take a deep breath don't assume the worst I think that the truth will come out\nWell I guess the question is and I'm not up on this ... is um what looks like malfeasance on the part of the Clintons and the and the Clinton Foundation is that in fact being investigated as we speak\n[noise] that is my understanding but I'm an outsider behind the bill of goods but there have been color will claims with respect to the handling all the Clinton uh the investigation and I think that there is back from what I understand but these republic reports nothing on the inside there is a second careful look\nBeing a being taken especially because we've seen some of the irregularities of the way for example\nA Hillary Clinton's interview was conducted right a very odd way and and and the grant of immunity and so forth so there's some\nQuestionable judgment doesn't mean that there were there there were crimes and so forth so not set of jumped in inclusions by our long ago\nGather the facts and assess the facts but there's science seems to be much that needs to be very careful exam and see whether there was in fact a a wrongdoing and I like to me it just cries out for close examination and I have great respect\nFor both so there's a set of that house intelligence committee's by\nBelieving the oversight functional talk a lot about that but I also have great belief in Italy internal checks and balances and the Justice Department and the FBI they both the other prevention responsibility that's the and the inspector general of the court of justice or repeal watchdogs\nWell that's encouraging and I think we need encouragement because I think many people believe that the Clintons always got to pass I think\nUm to some extent because a lot of people feared them uh I I think that when you're working for people who can be vindictive as they seem to have been a\n... it's frightening and people think I don't want trouble or even to the top levels I mean the fact that they gave her immunity or so and so what she seemed to be treated with kid gloves because people had a sense that this is going to be the next president and I better watch myself that that to me is very troubling\nWell by the way I think this is one of the reasons I don't tell you about this book but it's ... out of the principles that I Do I did assign a book why Hillary did not get the nomination two thousand they because a lot of people who knew the to the ... or the Democratic side of the aisle\nRushed to support someone else now why did she get Saddam and his ... years later\nLeave that to his story is to say but obviously the candidate who was\nHey I'm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one at one point one of

right before the election\nOr you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and or I Know in ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together or not McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that is when they blew the phones out of the cat on Capitol Hill you remember that one I read that was on a specific topic yeah I ... the\nSame thing ... bright that's powered are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because\nIt is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal\nOr interesting that they write this the same day that you know do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAnd and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet isn't part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he's separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd and supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter]\nThe one the one old out except for except for Bill Christ and I haven't seen anything from George\nAnd it's like ... yeah exactly so you know they're not part of the ... he he's not some of the right and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent and\nThe judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope of what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from ... I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah\nAnd don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nThe it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture war because it's a war on it it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe we were never tremors we've criticized Trump what we were you know we were never on that never never got about ... ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that what do we know a man he finally got outside I think I Would only vote for air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well ah you know I guess she wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on\nMany of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really do this is what you really we it wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm\nIt's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump ... looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was it a try to think of the the the the person oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump they'd rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nAh I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that\nI saw it on social media and a lot of people furious ... excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and uh that uh Jonathon as a ... there at a ... on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when it came out with the\nI'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the\nThe house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn ...\nA Pew report the eight hundred page report on Benghazi\nYes so I I think that's you know what's happening so again uh you look at that and you say wow liver looks at for Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner\nA which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending sue nominee\nFive weeks before the critical midterm elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of wells tourist democratic groups dedicated to winning the majority overwhelmed GOP defenses\nFrom financially flush superPACs flooding the zone with advertising the grassroots organizations directing money and volunteers to targeted areas around a dozen political groups\nAre feeling the Democratic party to flip twenty three seats and capture the house on November sex\nIn a toxic environment driven by discontent with President Donald Trump\nThe barrage has become too much to handle for the two groups manning the barricades for House Republicans the national Republican congressional committee their official campaign arm and congressional leadership fund their designated superPACs are guys are taking a beating ... Republican consultant\nAnd former and are cc executive director said Tuesday in an interview with the Washington or an egg examiner\nOr and so I mean just your you go through this whole article ... they they go through it specifically you know the money that's being spent by the Democrats and the vulnerabilities we're there to the point and these are the people the money people behind it saying\nWe're going to be swept by the Democrats yeah so which one is true well ... and and there's what yeah that's why you have the election right exact election day and and remember I'm a Casio Cortez her opponent spent ah think it was somewhere around three million\nAnd she spent right merge early enough again money doesn't always when you you know it it is the message is also the motivating factors that we've talked about and clearly Kavanaugh one way or the other I mean it in and I I Would agree with the peace to a certain extent\nA written in in a ... at our CPA and I'll get the author here in in in a minute a they deserve the credit but the idea that you know it's theoretically it could benefit either side\nYou know to a certain extent again but typically what do you see historically\nA there's been a a the younger demos\nTurned out for the primaries this year they don't always turn out\nNecessarily in November for a for a mid term so we'll see if that actually changes this year because again what could motivate them and a number of things could happen\nBetween let's just say I Kevin ... confirmed on a Saturday or Sunday and he's on the bench on Monday everything's going to change and there will be something else for people to talk about best Trump about or whatever it is and that's the difference so we'll see what happens eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and they're recording the radio [noise]\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "04"}
