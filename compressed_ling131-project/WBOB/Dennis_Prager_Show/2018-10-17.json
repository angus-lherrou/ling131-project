when I last year had you on this program ah you told me about your\nYour experience at a becoming a Christian it's kind of freaky funny story you you realize it's a funny story no similar going well funny people if people listen to part one would you do hear that because we're not going to rehash nonsense yeah All right I've had enough of that\nBut I'm the only the so you went to ... when you first went to air Bernard's church you versus the first time you saw\nKind of normal people in a church environment you had grown up with a lot of screaming unattractive ...\nScreaming and yelling and jumping like I was seven years old and a church last like six hours on number one time I was in church and there was a dead body in the front\nRight and nobody explained to me is the funeral was not church I'm thinking how to do church like\nThis is normal in a ... or ... what happened to them in in boxing her whole explanation was well he's in a better place and I'm thinking what kind of box even before life like there was no explanation for what you just made no sense and nobody was teaching and nobody was explaining underway to understood is so I'll just stay away from\nInto the story from the show as you should watch will do what kind of a box of skiing before it's funny because you don't know it's funny you just going to know to your reaction you know as you laugh\nAnd I don't laugh which is going to last time life is too short and go to Stuart ... times guys or buses laughter is just a waste ...\nYou're just yellow the horn you do that to you don't even\nKnow ha ha ha first grade and it's on there and just say the age because what what why do you why do you need to save the whole word you know what I'm saying like short here and and now look so you're now you're a professional comedian you've been a fresh in your whole adult life here and what a lot of people don't know his comedy is hard\nTo it's not it's not just like you'd have to invest some jokes like you really think about you got to write all the jokes and you got to memorize them and then you get a goal in front of people and the funniest material\nAnd make sure that actually works because if it doesn't then you'll know it pretty quick because ... county is the only craft that the audience can lie to you about\nMaybe what if you're going to sing you have no way of telling for sure if they loved it in afterwards with her I said to you was gray you're also maybe it could have been miserable because they don't want the acrimony there yeah but in comedy you're on stage\nHe's been joke doesn't work writers no way for the audience to collectively say hey everybody let's make them feel better right by the level of his job together ready go\nCan do I had the the the uh the only time it\nThat is do together ready to go you can\nDo I had the the the uh the only time anything like that has happened to me is uh Larry David who of course created Seinfeld\nWith uh what's his name Seinfeld uh Jerry Lewis and and they ... anyway Larry David did something on Broadway with cold like a fish in the dark or something like that rang\nAnd I knew Larry way back when before he was famous right or right before Seinfeld and like that and and he liked my humor and so we became friends he demeaning the friars club hanging out with her and then we kinda lost touch and\nAnd I um but but you know when he did this thing on Broadway a couple of years of that kind of thought you know I can go backstage and and say hello and I know who to like really freak him out because he knows I'm a Christian and that that you know that freaks certain people out and asked me if I hear\n\nPeople actually yeah and so we I I thought okay middle backstage and I watched the the play which puts a comedy and I hated it so much I could not go backstage\nWow and I know he doesn't listen to this program so free I could tell you that story but I did a show right with ... with a ... George Carlin you know what they what yeah which Carlin George Carlin ... you know before he died afterwards would have been oh yeah so do the show George Carlin and he did\nHe did one Fifteen minutes on why you shouldn't say God Bless like Fifteen minutes just on a subject and I went on after him and I said lady wild George Carlin and God Bless him was hanging out of the biggest laugh to have your editors cry laugh which are\nPutting 'cause that's such a lame joke but they still laugh at you and I think that the real thing Boyd so uh but you're you're right look I mean because I Do a lot of speaking what you just said well when I'm uh sometimes I Will preach sometimes I Will speak but always do funny stuff you have to and that's the only way\nI can know if they're tracking with me up so that has happened at times when I'm Talking\nLike pretty serious ... and I'm not getting anything back like I don't know what's going on and you feel like ... because I'm not getting the laughs\nI feel like the audience is now with meat laughter is the only way you can guarantee you're into that they're tracking absolutely the end or are there but but you're absolutely right if anything else you really have no way of knowing I mean you can't really in play and if it's not a comedy you like did they love it did they hate it I don't know\nYou don't know and then you just got some critics are going to write some bought it like the people that's where I like comedy so much you know media Italy and you'll know immediately if you should probably get another job so I get some uh comedians were asked me questions especially new Comey's they'll say stuff like how can I really make it in comedy and this is my wife\nI said this yesterday on a radio show that was way more fun than this one yeah I'm a ... uh\nI said there's no such thing as a pure stand up comedian there just isn't I mean there's some really really really funny guys with their but only to say to yourself I'm going to be a standup comedian only is actually a ticket to misery\nWhat I mean by that is is comedy is a vehicle it's not a destination\nBut now you know why is that because I'm thinking of people who did comedy ... you know and that was their only thing so what do you mean by that vehicle to what\nWill a vehicle to something greater than just making people laugh because if you think about some of the great some of the great thing comedy think about being in like what it it looked like at\nThe end I don't know about that or did they certainly tried to attach themselves to something bigger by one of the water like a ... of one of the great to know people don't like been sick all in one of the greats anymore was Bill Cosby\nThere is no doubt in the world of comedy you one of the greats right one of the greats go towards the end of his career before all that other stuff jumped off he actually started going through communities are mainly black communities and talking to people about how important it is to make sure you're doing the right things Seventy something years old he has a point where you realize\nLike what did I Do I just made it most people laugh\nLike like people at at a certain point you started to say wait what even greater would actors you say you're so what what are what am I what I really do I'm sure bankers are by all sort of like what did I Do because they have all of this set up and they haven't deliver a real plus my\nFear I I like this idea now I've got to ask you do you uh\nWho who are your influence is growing up when you were a kid you not that much younger than me so when you were a kid I Would have people that you said I Want to do that I find that that that guy's funny or did you did you know as a kid you want to be a comedian what were you thinking as a\nKid when I was three years so uh I used to watch you are listening to you on that just in general yeah that's very funny than to that area and um no my role but it was hard to try to achieve so I thank God I'm younger now ... says ... is that your Walker Britain\nLook now wait a second quarter were practically the same age\nAs you shave your hair off\nNobody can tell if it's gray yeah yeah that's an ... Indian trick and I'm not going for it and here's your come on your influence is growing up poor they let me just finish this little comment was in fact you know because you just put your hair on your way to fix I Know I'm very open with my audience\nThis is a this is a a a wealth fitted horse hair wig had commissioned from a weak master I said\nI said money's no object I don't want the finest wig money can buy and he said well that's going to be horse here because of course here hold that value is from turkey derby too and I got to meet the ... and it was a very intelligent horse and I said\nI Want that on my head so they kill the horse and a lot of behind it but they said that uh Eric they said this is going to it's expensive but it's going to hold its value if you want to resell that wing someday gravity get\nMost of the money that you pay for it so that's what you're looking at right now we're\nProbably nine seconds press the joke was or ... you should have jumped in and say hey let's start in ...\nSo what do you what do you know about jokes and this was going to try to ask you who were your influences\nSo here's what gets really weird about this question in and among go ahead and answer so is this is this is where people don't understand so when I first started to accommodate it was the strangest thing I'm doing comedy and I completely lost my taste for watching comedy like it's a no is so we're\nLike I Would be on TV trying to watch for I Would be um\nWhen you first started doing comedy when I started doing comedy or I'll be at the club\nAnd you know and the New York if you're at a club you're only doing may be at the most ten minutes right in the whole show is two and a half hours long I so I wouldn't watch any of that to me is before me and I wouldn't watch any comedians after me and there were some great comedians on stage and I figured out why and I'll tell you why\nOn the other side of the break while you're the master of this art form we'll be right back folks in the air attacks is shows stick around\nKelvin I Want to tell you about real effect or yeah yeah I take it all the time I Know a lot of people take it half the the the media are talking about it but on this program instead of me talking about it how about if we can get somebody else to talk about it somebody for example named ...\nOh over the years that I got older I notice painting my hip

a diesel it was a crank and they had a wood burning TV but they you know they got to listen to the radio it was basically your age I don't know what you're saying\nBut they basically I Would watch those things in the in ... to me the funniest guys\nRace I don't know what you're saying for Bayh basically our watch those things in the in ... to me the funniest guys that were ritual it'll Mm I had him on this program also but I mean his his impressions are just amazing goal maize and right and uh\nAnd of course Don Rickles foster books and Charlie callous are you familiar with foster Brooks and Charlie callous no where is that true that is true I actually think that foster books and Charlie callous or to the funniest human beings ever in the history of comedy and the only place I encountered that they will be on the Tonight Show with is that rarely but foster books\nAnd jelly cows on the on the on the dean Martin roast it Charlie callous trying now I mean those are the only two comedians I can think of that you cannot\nNot laugh like there's no way you are not going to laugh is or where did you bring Camille ... ... talk about for every ... ... yeah to go very ... very weird\n'cause you're white voters you bring up ex girlfriends ... it was amazing no for an order them and also\nYou know he was he in all seriousness though you but I mean I just wanted to ask me that a comedian that you don't say like when I was growing up there was this one now as a cause I those you know there's a handful of people that I just think they're that to me the gold standard I always think of them\nYou know a business in for me even in school like I wasn't a funny guy in school\nWhen I was in the class clown or grow up in a household where you have to wear were grown folks are talking you just listen to 'em if you ever see me at a party yeah first of all is not me if somebody looked like me who I don't like Ross people but if it is me I'm In the corner very quiet now say anything just looking there may be taking notes\nBecause of my comedy comedy actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... up another quiz is really bad start to look at words differently like I'm Talking about even in middle school\nHave I'd have to look at the ... and the color to position you what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what the where it was no joke ... got really good at it to the point in high school people didn't know I wasn't really reading I was just working out really really fast now as an adult I read just fine\nBut I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company you\nKnow where you are right here genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see if I remember when I heard you do comedy at one point you went into this in depth and he told a story and I realized that that's just a freaky gift like what\nIt is because it could be a curse but it's a gift in your case using it for me right like sometimes people they don't have to see things the way they see them or as the kind of a gift\nBut you're able to turn it into ... first person to call me a genius or really kind of touched me a little through promise you I'll be the last ... because people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize trouble in the ... working through [laughter]\nIf I had far no law but I mean I\nDon't I Try not to use words like that lately I I think it's true and I said that you have you have a a you have an outrageous gift and that's what enables you to be funny even the way you talk about humor you're thinking about it you're looking at it from the different you know a lot of musicians and instinctive thing ... and they they have never thought about it they just know how to do it would have to\nThere's two things I've learned that really so whenever you someone laugh to retain more information rather just they just simply do retain like at least thirty percent more information that's why the super bowl commercials are so funny they always make them funny because they wanted to remember their product well\nThat's so when I Do comedy if I'm if people if their hearts are open I like to make a deposit so even for example in the movie a mortar funny we were making a deposit were strategically making it a positive and the people\nEven though it's Ninety seven percent funny but people will be moved there was a ... as a result of this like just eight year olds who come to my shows who are laughing and then even crying as a result of some of the stuff that we share in between germinate\nStep drinking a drug in and they yeah go into comedy who do even the eight year olds ... year we're reaching a you know say hey you need to get your life together so you do not so I'm just fascinated that I Want to ask you a simple question like that you would ask any comedian like career in France going up you you're kind of telling me you didn't have any\nYou know I respect a bunch of comedians and really enjoy watching them now but now I think about the war there were influence meaning influenced my style like it was they had a they cause me to change my ... and\n\n[noise]\nHey I'm six hundred
