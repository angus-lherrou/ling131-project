partisan\nPolitical people are still refusing to acknowledge it because\nI I guess this proves the point and the fear that many of us had that this ... this had nothing to do with sexual assault and everything to do with making sure that this man was not confirmed to the Supreme Court and now that I have to say that is what's called politics naked ugly\nPolitics and it's terrible and then it comes down to what they think he's going to do about abortion in this country as well which ... which by itself is so silly but that will put that aside put aside I mean I just want to say that I really have\nA and I've said this for a couple of years now is why I wrote my book if you can keep it I Am very concerned for my country why I'm well first of all\nThis is the greatest country in the history of the world not because I say so not because I'm a great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas

that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the Kavanaugh nomination\nA has been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle traditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now they no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake\nI'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now [noise]\nPray for this country and we always say that pray for the ... I mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer\nFor this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we are we're talking about\nWhat a mandate or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever I think wow this is this is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P ... relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the uh uh an FBI probe\nOf course Feinstein and others say oh it's not the right kind of a ... not deep enough it's not brought up which really means that they won the latest forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks have got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything\nI have ever seen a and so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we could heal and that people who are naked lead part is and\nUh would would understand that we have certain standards that we have to abide by no matter what that was my that I wouldn't want to say that my fear is if Kavanaugh does not get a a put on the Supreme Court and the Democrats take over in November\nThat that is the one two punch that will knock out all their ... and this is why thank you for reminding me to say to everybody you need to vote and actually I Want to say particularly\nFor having had the audacity to write a book in which he mentions what the Bible says about\nSexuality oh my goodness\nGentleman um I'm thrilled to have you back to talk about these things because the honor to be here is is this a wonderful and you know are we talked last time we were together a cheap talking about your story but there's so many other\nStories out there right now and I know a ... David accord menu as senior counsel and VP of litigation\nAt ATF you've seen these stories I think a lot of Americans just don't believe that this kind of stuff happens in America or if it happens it's very very rare but the other side\nSeems to be very nasty end very litigious they want to come after people\nSo it goes against the narrative that we were just talking about live and let live let let people live their lives and now we're seeing that no if you dare step out of line if you publish a book when you mention what the Bible says about sexuality you're going to pay a price\nThat's nasty that is not tolerant but that is what's happening and I'm sitting here with a man that happened to you or a chief Cochran I mean what are some of these other cases that we're seeing right now or that you you yourself David have litigated\n... it's incredible because it's not limited to New York or California or the places you would think it's everywhere in the Bible belt it's in Georgia it's in Kentucky it's from coast to coast so people think well those are in isolated spots around the country they're not they are everywhere\nAnd as we mentioned last time if they can come after that the chief they're going to come after anyone and we've got cases are throughout the country we've got 'em we people have heard from the Supreme Court case about masterpiece cake shop what's\nAmazing about that if they're all those years we've got a gentleman who has a bakery who serves everyone but because he was a Christian he doesn't do all messages and promote all the pets so he doesn't do for example Halloween cakes he doesn't do cake celebrating divorce that people do sometimes he doesn't do anything against God or family or country patriotic gentleman as as the cheapest\nAnd so when someone came to him and said we want you to bake a cake to celebrate to participate in our same sex wedding ceremony and said look I can sell you anything in the store I could make any other take that specific I cannot celebrated promote that event\nBecause it violates my beliefs they go against him they sue him we go all the way up to the Supreme Court recently we had a great victory you've talked about that well apparently it's not over because they've come after him again okay they basically have an activist now\nWho set him up and came after him and said we want to\nYou basically have an activist now who set him up in came after him and said we want a couple of things I Want a cake that celebrates their transition from a man to a woman that that goes from pink or blue on the outside to pick on the inside\nThey ask for other cakes with say panic symbols and messages sexual ... messages and they're finding discrimination and going against him again okay\nSo this is so this is what I Want my my listeners uh to to understand because again I Know a lot of good people in America and they just they have this idea I was one of them I had this idea that listen if I just keep my head down and be good person nobody will bother me [noise]\nJak Philips is the definition of a good person he is friendly to gay people he is not a big it OK so somebody comes to him a while ago and says we want you to bake a cake celebrating our same sex marriage and he poll lightly politely to he doesn't say\nYou know hey fags get outta my store he doesn't ... he is\nA loving generous man now you'd think that he would have said something like that that he would pick them up baseball bat and said I'm not going to serve your kind whatever\nAbsolutely not\nShe says that anything that ... that goes against my religion including baking a Halloween cake he would not make a Halloween cake you will not bake a cake that says down with the u._s._a. but\nI mean it's like going to a portrait artist at the same thing and saying like you know I I Want you to paint my portrait and my wife's portrayed and we're going to be naked and we're gonna have swastikas on us right we're going to pay you and you got to do it\nNo you don't got to do it right so if you go to this guy he's he's a he's the name of the the stores masterpiece cake I mean it's this just he's doing art this is not just like you selling you hamburgers okay so\nHe is persecuted because somebody says we're going to ... we want to cause trouble we're going to come in there and we're not we're not we're going to we're going to say if you do not bake a cake celebrating our same sex wedding\nOr your you know you're you're going to get it you're going to get it so so this nice man has to go to the Supreme Court thanks to you an ATF and everybody he\nWins the case okay\nSo we think we're done with that\nAnd now you're telling me that somebody in Colorado\nHas decided to come after him and if ever anybody needs to prove this is why I wanted to talk to you about this if anybody needs proof\nOf nastiness of vindictive ness of the other side on this this is not live and let live\nThey come to him deliberately to cause trouble\nAnd they say we want you to already knowing he's jak Philips already knowing you one of the Supreme Court they come to him and say we want you to ... bake a cake celebrating transition from men to women is that right okay that it's almost funny like they want him to do this they want to be but as a blue on the inside them but whatever but I think on the outside or whatever\nBut here's the kicker and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to say this for my listeners so they can get this if you want to understand what you are dealing with right now folks listened carefully\n[noise] because I read this [noise]\nThe people wanted him to put a satanic symbol on the top of the cake\nAnd it's just it's a satanic figure performing a sexual act if I were to describe it on the program it would have to be censored I I don't do a program where children cannot listen we're husbands wives cannot listen without getting embarrassed\nBut what these people asked this Christian man jak Philips this humble man\nOr to do was vial pornographic satanic genuinely pornographic we're not talking soft porn [noise]\nAnd they decided we're going to play with this guy we're going to where we want this kind of trouble that's how vicious they are so now that this happened where are we\nSo here's what's incredible about so you have an activist who set this up and they file a complaint with the civil rights commission which are not there didn't name only and and rather than seeing it for what it is that the set up with this pornographic vials say panic\nCake or they basically find cause to investigate are now going after him again you know now this government commission that set up\nWhich are completely biased to set up in the first by in fact what's interesting about these commissions one of the requirements is and and\nJust think if this would ever be allowed for a jury right\nThat the majority of the commissioners have to be someone who is either in would be discriminated against or is part of a group of people that that would have been discriminate wait a minute wait a minute you're kidding me that's that's built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so they said they set that up that's right\nAnd and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack or minding their own business people like the cheap or minding their own business and it's it's not activists who are out there and people's faces these are people living their lives according to their faith and they're actually finding them seeking them out and going after them in jurisdictions\n... this is why I say if if we're real Americans do not stand up against this violence is if this is my listeners folks this is you right now right if you don't stand up now and do something\nOr if you don't if you don't understand that this is happening you're you're going to be part of the problem you cannot stay silent because the people have soda so to speak come at a closet on the other side there are no longer pretending to be nice nice they're not playing Patty cake no pun intended they are out\nFor scallops they want to take down anybody who dares defy what they say and we're talking about nice people like the chief who's sitting right here nice people like Jack felt in other words the real big it's\nThey don't want anything to do with the real big if they want to come after nice people who are definitely not bigots and they want to say we're going to make an example of you you're going down we have the courts on our side we have the media on our side and it's why I said in my small platform on this radio program I Want people to know\nIf you allow this to go on you cannot complain when they're going to they will come after you are somebody because this is how nasty it as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys are are practically the only game in town I mean you have been doing this for years fighting this battle\nAnd it amazes me that you have pro bono lawyers how many lawyers do you have across the country that are working for you guys\nSo we have about sixty five lawyers internally for ATF but then we have a over three thousand lawyers or allied attorneys are also committing pro bono our okay\nFor the working for free that's where it for free so I say to my listeners

intimidated a teachers are being intimidated people everywhere are being intimidated in fact sometimes intimidate themselves by self censoring they say oh I better not say that because I get in trouble and I think that is that\nIt's flat out wrong when you when you in America you have the right\nTo religious liberty you have the right to talk about your faith where ever you are we all know when it gets inappropriate\nBut the point is that when people self centered and why don't want to I don't share the whole yeah you don't want to share the good news you don't want to even want to help a kid in your classroom whose life is all messed up and and you could share with the kid after class about about God or something like that it's like no I better not have better not\nSo people can\nCome to you in and say\nOkay I'm being persecuted first of all how do they reach the alliance defending freedom if somebody has a genuine case [noise]\nSure I mean there are several ways to reach us that we have a one eight hundred number one eight hundred tell ATF um ATF legal dot org is our website but what's what's what's amazing about about that is is what the other side is so good at is is name calling and writing and accusing\nSo what better way to to win a debate as to silence the other side and the way they do that is by putting you know your bigoted your homophobic you're a hater I mean how much we heard all that stuff\nAnd so what happens if someone says well I don't want to speak up because I'm a hater or I'm I'm a big it well those names are meant to silence you rather than having a debate on the issues we get into this ... that has nothing to do with what's going on and simply to silence folks I think you're right by telling people to to take us\nThere and there there are people there are are so called Christians are who are confused on this where I I haven't been called like on Twitter accused of making like a racial remarks ...\nThese people are saying they don't know what real racism is they don't know what real bigotry is I mean go around the world where you will see real bigotry real racism but\nPeople are are so sensitive now that you're afraid to talk and I I Want to say I want to be a leader in this and say folks\nThis is not right this is like\nThis is there's something viable went in a free country groups are trying to tell you shut your mouth do not share ... even if what I Want to share is wrong I have a right as an American to speak my mind even if I'm a fool\nI have the right to speak in America so I'm not telling you you have to agree with me but I have the ... of the right to speak but we're self censoring people are afraid and as you said\nThere's there are people out there that they know they they can't win the argument so all they can do is say shut up and if you don't you lose your job you'll be ... you know\nThat is it's so vile that I think most people when they really get it to like they get angry they said this is this is despicable I'm not going to stand for this I Hope people listen to this program understand\nThis is not right and you need to be part of the battle I don't know what that means uh some some people can write a big check to ATF I Hope they will other people can just educate themselves and speak up when you get an opportunity because if you don't speak up some day folks you won't have the ability to speak up or or getting their\n... and what's what's interesting you mentioned this happened in schools that happens in colleges and universities\nI mean if if people follow the news there are these biased response teams which means if a student says something that happens to offend someone they report them\nThe administration them comes after them with its like sensitivity training and so they're actually going into these situations where you can't speak your faith because obviously that's going to offend someone\nI'm trying to shut the students down even before they get into their careers and into into the public square so they're getting them at a young age teaching them that it's better not to share your faith which obviously we know it's important to do so and they're getting them when they're young\nThere are people around the world being killed for sharing their face their people around the world being killed for being Christians\nAnd in this country we're afraid

I\nI was watching the Christian work this afternoon and what are their correspond so it's talking about ...\nFord wanting the FBI to have her therapy notes from two thousand twelve and\nNo no no no she didn't know she did she tell you well she did and I mean not all of that is what she did not want back she was holding back the notes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe ... are from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there is a big difference in other words within it it it's it it's part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWhat no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats and then they and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything not a criminal matter wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they in\nFact what the FBI would deal with it would be put into the three oh two\nRight which then the Democrats and Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI in his entire equation is to give the Senate the information\nYou're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway that's in\nFact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be get putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take it out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to the absolute into go that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and any one and if if that that would if Ford's if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that\nA and forge assuming Ford's lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after because of the background check the supplemental is over\nFor cover electronics here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where

thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono\nOther than a year communications with me and my staff member my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and\nPatrick Smith and a deadly re mirrors Julie sweat Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter sent yesterday so it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because\nOur point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with\nYeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply\nTake it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only by senators would set the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence mhm and she wants to people was that she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to grasp it directly outside of the three oh two because then\nThe other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak it\nExactly or\nGenerating we wait for [laughter] just release the entire route to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n\n'cause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a relief wells the Washington Post and the wall Street Journal [noise] no\nI mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sent here in front of them were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nAmong please let us know your please give to us you know what you have shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa ... yeah\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have right what what is what is that what is that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again\nWe're getting into areas you know with the lawyers data they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah\nYeah it's a demand that doesn't even a demand that would in a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the nodes would never become public right you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day if you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that\nOr eight six six Ninety right out let's go to Sherman in Indonesia Sherman welcome urine

Republican\nAs you pointed out it is just sheer committees job to investigate Kavanaugh and this whole situation and Dianne Feinstein wrote struck the justice I don't know why everybody's just not totally up in arms about this\nMaybe eventually they will be but to me that the ... we are criminal and all of this because it by signing released it releases for makes it back in July it would've been quietly handle and investigate it thoroughly it would maintain\nThe anonymity of the laws they forward it would have respected Kavanaugh's reputation\nAnd they would have gotten to the bottom but they can either cabin or would affect ... status nomination\n... and ... was it four would have been proved to be right or not but I N Feinstein obstructed justice here and pull this last minute she should be you know we're at a town a rail for obstructing justice I mean it's a criminal action\nWell if you look at it as whom who betrayed the trust of of Dr Ford\nIt was fine and it was ... it was that was the Democrats right now they're the ones that lead to the media have if if we're taking Dr Ford at her word ... then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats right\nExactly [laughter] biggest thing that's being there and it was a comedy of the ends justify the means shipped over and over getting more and more ...\nAnd I just don't understand why every American would it be up in arms over and find science I really don't I don't get it\nYeah get him ... thanks for listening in Indonesia yeah he's in bother\nSo wow wow\nThat we were in terms of we we
