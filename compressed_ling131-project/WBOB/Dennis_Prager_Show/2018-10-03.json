I'm going to talk to Ken Starr he has written finally a memoir of the Clinton investigation it's called contempt we're going to have Ken Starr on in just a few moments for the rest of the hour but right now\nI'm going to talking about something that is absolutely crazy and one of the most interesting things I've encountered in the last couple of years there is a guy named mark Taylor a who hears from God and now you're going to say I don't know about this exactly\nWhich is why you need to be listening carefully right now there's a movie that is available tonight that's Tuesday a and also I think Thursday night it's called the Trump prophecy and we have the filmmaker on the line right now Rick Eldridge welcome to the program\nHey thanks area to be here\nWell listen you are my audience doesn't know anything about this I Want to talk to mark Taylor at length about this but this film is coming out tonight it's a fathom event tell us for somebody who knows nothing about it what is this\nDramatic feature that basically the story of marks life mark as a public servant firemen who uh at the end of his career a kind of like being in a battle do it in and out of fires and and and seeing some some terrible things obviously\nA was having trouble sleeping tormented by a lot of that and a key date\nApril two thousand eleven he was a channel surfing three o'clock in the morning and here's this guy talking to a couple of international business guys that but to be Donald Trump and uh he got this premonition that he was a hearing the voice the next president\nOkay now I read it at that time pretty basic\nTwo thousand and all that even he is Donald Trump on TV and he believes that God's speak to him and says this is the next president of the United states now\nTo believe that Donald Trump can be president in two thousand eleven is plum loco so what did market tailor the firemen think when God's ... did speak to him normally with just a new thing for him\nIt's a very new thing for him and uh like I say it was three in the morning and he actually wrote it in his diary and many put a question mark\nBy like really [laughter] and what it didn't happen he kind of forgot all about it and wait wait wait I didn't have many many twelve is what you're saying\nYeah exactly and then uh you know several years later fast forward he was having some treatment with a doctor Colbert and uh you know shared some of his diary and this came up and Dr ... it was very intrigued them right now it's like being the Fifteen or sixteen\nAnd a and it's a real thing and that basically became a loop loads of prayer across the country and many many of us know that you know the faith community had a big part of\nA Trump becoming president\nAnd a rallying point and um but this this prayer call that a Nancy Colbert the doctors started a blew up servers all over America they were over a hundred thousand people calling in a toward the got closer to the election every day and I gave him you know to pray for our nation\nWell business something my wife my wife and I know about this and that is one of the reasons I wanted to have you wanted to tell my listeners about this because\nThis is not crazy this is very very um shocking when you hear the details but I've looked into it closely enough that I take it seriously that ... some people here from God more\nTaylor is one of those people you just a person just like any of us uh he's not some amazing scene but he does pray and he hears from God and what I have read about him and I've heard some of his interviews I thought\nThis guys on the level this guy's not kooky\nHe's very buttoned up ... he's just not a\nSome people when you hear them you think ... who who knows what we're getting we're getting you know right ten percent God and Ninety percent to ... but this guy that strikes me is very real and Mary ... exactly the same thing and people can look them up on line ... CEO Welby yard tea and mark Taylor but\nUh in the investigation that led to the Starr Report that led to the impeachment of\nYou don't even know that President Clinton was impeached indeed he was it's a it's an extraordinary story from our history and I am privileged to have a the author of a new book contempt ... of the Clinton investigation Ken Starr welcome to the program\nToday thank you Eric is so great to be back with you well\nFirst of all I Can't believe that uh you finally wrote a book about the one thing that people associate with your name this is a a dark period in American history it's not long ago it seems like yesterday to me and probably seems like yesterday to you\nBut to hear your side of the story I have really long for this and so uh what was it that persuaded you finally did tell the story of the Clinton investigation I'm In your in your from your point of view\nWell Erica combination of circumstances on a I've been very busy ah productively so I Hope\nUh doing what I Hope the Lord's work it popped on university at Yale University and then one of my circumstances changed ... Baylor and twenty sixteen I just said I've got to write a book but it wasn't about to Clinton invest it and it was about my day for years how wonderful pale university is\nYeah we ... we talked about that ah about a year ago on this program that's right\nExactly and so I was working on that through the salt twenty sixteenth something else was happening there was a president ... uh yeah well he lost the election I searched or the Baylor book up their country at Baylor story a and\nAnd I said okay Joe I Want to go back to full time law practice whatever a volunteer your church work there what do I really want to do and\nI just felt moved all things considered it was now or never to write the story my\nDemand more of the Clinton years because frankly as you know Eric there was so much to say on understood or misunderstood the port Merrick and people\nYeah well uh it's an amazing story and it's all the more amazing when we look at where we are now in early October of twenty Eighteen or facing crazy stuff the stuff with with Kavanaugh now you new\nCabinet rather well and he was himself involved with you centrally or in this uh investigation\nInto white water and and the Clintons can you say a few words about him since he's in the News I'm constantly as we speak\nYes my my heart has been breaking for a judge Cabot on his beautiful family\nI Know him and he was a not only ... first colleagues in your best to ... going back to Nineteen Ninety four when he was coming off the court she'll put Justice Kennedy was a pivotal member of the team\nWorked alongside one another he was universally respected within the investigation by the most ... talk FBI Ira ... agents and and a great prosecutors to who was the department of justice was coveted awards\nFor the performance or if he was young but he was tough [noise] he was honest a person of total integrity and then I practice law with Brett ah and my father in law for the Washington DC\nBut he was a great friend by the way of religious liberty I can tell that story it's we have time or in terms of or is it will commitment and then\nOf course is public services now quite well no so the allegations are so inconsistent wildly so with the Brett Kavanaugh who I Know who I Love\nAnd so uh I I've never met a trip Ford a bell heard her testimony but I have the advantage of knowing but capital and knowing him as we heard from so many people here\nAs a person of complete integrity of rock corrupt character and so it ... me that this has happened but I Walk on the side of the street I Hope and pray that once the FBI or in Korea now is completed that even with all the controversy he will\nGet what I think is actually deserved a seat on the Supreme Court stepping into the shoes of the justice for whom ed clerked out that they do the\nRight well I I Want to ask you um a couple of things is there's so much judge star and uh I I Want to have plenty of time to talk about a\nYear book I really am just so excited that uh the written this book the title is contempt for those who are interested in the title and of course the author Ken Starr with two wars as in Ringo okay so I don't want to ask you before ...\nIt was your love of music in\nThere you get ... well not not going to get a fused with Richard stark he his previous name Ringo Starr and so ... we're talking about a ... well we're talking about current events when when we talk about Kevin ... the most grievous thing to me\nUh uh is is not that ah\nI I guess let me put it this way he may be a stellar character but it's always possible it somebody stellar character at one point in like didn't have stellar character and did terrible things so the real issue is\nHow is it possible that was genuinely no evidence we are\nTrying this man in the court of public opinion it's fundamentally American every American should be scared to death that we adopt this\nAs our way of going forward that we cease to be America we cease to be a free people and people are listening you ceased to be safe when we throw away due process\nWhat do you think is is going to going to happen because this is a dark day especially for the Democrats who have been pushing this along these lines\nI Would begin with first principles that emerge out of who yours a free people going back to my car to the party to the constitution of the bill of rights and you're so right due process of law\nThat's a little bit of a fancy way of saying as a child would ask that fear is that really fear\nAnd I have a number of fairness concerns are pretty deep ones quite apart from my personal a love for and respect and admiration for for ... brat a and I I've been very vocal and my criticism about the way this scandal\nUh especially Senator Feinstein and then\nAnd my criticism about the way this scandal uh especially Senator Feinstein and then no one called you're really to to ask a on her side of the aisle so that it became just parts of the issue\nOf the political as they should have our Supreme Court were to very much lament but it was Felix Frankfurt or a great justice on the Supreme Court from yesteryear\nWho wrote the history of liberty is largely history procedure\nBut when you think about that yeah that's right now in court you need to have the right to notice what's this all about the right to prepare to be the right to counsel and so forth and so to the ... court but then the way this is a very uh Judith tore kind to\nCost us for assessing facts and so forth and ... says I think there was a terrible\nUh laments herbal rush to judgment that she must be right she must be right not only that something terrible happened but that she's identified the perpetrator and how can how can been fearing us with a presumption of innocence and all those things that we hold dear we just\nCast those all aside and simply say will cause about the Supreme Court so I Will rush to judgment I Will presumed guilt and I think that's just profoundly wrong so a Brett I'm sure it gets called judge Kavanaugh so geared to me and I said that it that to the world I'm Glad\nIt has been I think treated unfairly he called it a national disgrace from his perspective I think it is not just a family tragedy for you know but it was beautiful but frankly I think it's a national tragedy will recover from it\nAs we always do was to all people but I think we need to have a basic conversation about fair that's just because one of the uh of alleges something that that is the old song goes it ain't necessarily so at least with respect to it was Brett Kavanaugh and I just don't think it was I Believe ...\nWell but again it it is it really so much about believing him as it is looking at the facts in other words let's say he said what he said and she said what he said and then we can say well based on what I Know I Believe him because we know it was character but the fact uh don't lead us\nTo believe him based on what he said they they lead us to believe him based on the evidence that's been offered and that's what I find chilling is that people it it's one thing to only have these two testimonies but we have\nOther evidence or to corroborate or not corroborate and that has to be to use the legal term dispositive right I mean if we have nothing else to go on we've got to go on what we've got\nAnd she hasn't produced any cooperative evidence but it ... it doesn't seem to stop people from acting as though she has it's a it's a just a strange day for us as Americans and I'm I'm trying to trying to figure it out\n[laughter] I think he's a potential watershed moment uh you're right I I tend to because of my knowledge of him and not from afar working with him in a highly pressurized situations but most of them live closer to the book and I describe it the book\nUh Erica our times together and ah he was there with me he at one period when he went off to the law for like was said he came back during the Monica Lewinsky face he was great to do that you know he knew that was a career in hamster\nAnd I did I tell you that I take ... yes you did I take relief factor because running a causes me sometimes back pain or hip pain or whatever

change all of that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday would add to that what happened to the price of documents story and a Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that throughout well it it nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh\nSo Trump decided not to release it but he didn't go to the he didn't go to his a director of intelligence\nThe uh the information whether it should be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general pretty quiet classify something you go to the inspector general give something because you proceed there might be corruption and what you at ... for governor

PA\nInto New York city and Boston your national forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or writers down we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over and we went we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general inspector general\nYou know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and and uh\nAll of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people at the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nWere more working to get information and use that false information\nThat ... uh\nTo get a warrant knowingly using it to get a ... of war it then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive well\nIt it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right\nYes that they that they they ... they sign documents stating that this information is intelligence mhm when in reality it was simply you know of opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they vouch for its\nAuthenticity ... often to city or credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani upset we don't know but it only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because it would be good at it that was what had happened right these than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know when he was involved but\nIf if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general and the head of the FBI a foreign powers\nAnd so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably you will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release\nYou know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be\nThat that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already but to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it looking y inspector general only looks at corruption right\nInspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks at corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice\nThat's what his job is his job is not to declassify is not just job is not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassify it and and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like well wait a minute he's inspector general and undo that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they on redacted it\nApparently someone in the administration looked at it and said\nThis is corruption give it to the inspector general because that's because that's what you would look at it the ... the inspector general's basically uh their to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that is essentially that internal\nAh investigation he the the inspector general's office really has internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when an aunt\n\nThat it's I could see General Kelly looking at the president and saying Mr President\nIf you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has you know there's we we have to build the political will to go after people if the inspector general\nComes out with an official report that's different not that the president and the and and uh the ... sessions couldn't go after people for this\nIt's that it would start in the political arena if you hand them over to the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done\nNot talking about you know the things about uh the licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he has said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the process and this would be the process you would want to go through\nTo see the have the inspector general\nLook at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here to see if this is exactly if if it's what we see and then\nYou noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general ... somebody may have done it I've not seen it before and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen\nReally anything maybe a maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media went completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nThat the new has like a couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why it went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything that you haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from a ... noon as a in over a week on it saying well look we need to get this ... released why\nRight because if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd what what would the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages that everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were ... and that would be corruption inside of the department of justice\nAnd the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he'd be looking at this\n\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago it was like\nOh and there's been nothing on this story and other media the media\nIs gone quiet all begin higher Russian collusion narrative\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus has cabin all but ... they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same fine but when it comes to going out at a drop in New York Times brought up his family tax yes exactly why not collusion oh where's that story\nBut that's a great point you made is you know he's going through the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you were at least is then they're just gonna say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting them don't know what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general nobody's going to debate the inspector general\nNo not even not even the ... the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michel horror which was ... so you go to him and he'd been and he does it which is the proper process to do with it that way you take the\nPolitical aspect out of it right and especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the more investigation\nAnd you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but all of that's taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself all of those claims go away\nBecause or which will you know even though you know the president want want this done a ...\nIn an expedited manner Horwitz will do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption\n[noise] do you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six Ninety right I\nWould go with what I told ...
