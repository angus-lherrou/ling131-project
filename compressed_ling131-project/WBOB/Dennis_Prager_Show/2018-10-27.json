now and again God face a I have in the studio or the author of a brand new book the book is called in good faith questioning religion and atheism and the author Scott Shay is with me now Scott welcome\nIt's really a pleasure to be here Eric ... it's it's difficult to describe mom difficult to describe usually too so I like people who are difficult to describe you um you ... your your the cofounder of signature bank of New York\nUh you you have a background or on Wall street private equity venture capital um and ah you've been a commentator uh on\nUm a while and financial issues and many other things so what is it a that brings you to write a book you a financial person or on the subject of faith the religion atheism how did how did we get here\nWell in a certain kind of way we got here when I was ten years old I was sitting at my parents are might particularly my father my father was a Holocaust survivor he was liberated by the Americans luckily and made its way to Chicago\nAnd he was playing poker at the Jewish slipped waning Columbus Chicago and one day just before Russia China not that far from the time of year\nThat one of the they were playing poker and one other one of his fellow said can we go to Russia shot a service is this your how can we go to high holiday services this year where was God when we needed help and everybody stopped talking and it is in the air when people didn't talk about their experiences and the whole cost I seldom heard\nOne person says there is no God get over it we're out around the next person at the table says\nGod get over it we're out around the next person at the table says I'm that this was a\nFailure of of people look at all of our Christian neighbors they watched as we were deported in in my father's case watched as my father's father was murdered my grandfather was murdered and did nothing [noise]\nAnother person said you know what we can't understand the world Israel wouldn't have happened without the Holocaust so a greater good even though that's hard to stomach a greater good came from all from six million people being murdered and since then I've always wondered about that court question that\nPeople asked which is how can a nominee benevolent God allow evil on earth and so I've been in a way thinking about these questions since before we bar mitzvahed\nAt and they'd been bubbling with me and I've I've as I've grown older I'd heard so many people say that it's not rational to believe in God with all we know about science and the history of the of the Bible and and monitor morality\nAnd frankly I think that's totally wrong\nI've read all the books I read all the books that Richard ... not all of them but I read most of what Richard Dawkins wrote Christopher Hitchens Daniel tenet even you've all Harare and I'm Steven Pinker and people would say well I read ... and I'm an atheist or read I read ... Hawkins that I'm an atheist and I'd say\nYou haven't really sat down and thought about these things and I\nYou know they geared if nobody's doing it a in a way that I'd like I'm going to do it in\nA way that are like now you where did you grow up I grew up in Chicago did grow up in Chicago um and you you were raised with as a as a nominal do was was was was your Jewish faith a central to your life in any way was just something that you had privately going on\nMostly it was private so when my father arrived ... into the unite the right one more I'm more but just one more to more words about my father my father was liberated which sixty pounds [noise] um he had been slave labor he had been in the concentration camps and luckily was liberated by the Americans who nursing I'm ...\nPounds ... set is practically impossible to think of\nIf he had been liberated uh with his if he had been liberated a week later he would've been dead I wouldn't be here today I mean he was on the verge of death\nAre you come to the right place I'm sitting here in the studio at their conduct show talking Scott Shane his book is in good faith questioning religion and\nAtheism okay so Scott you um\nAt some point you decided All right I Want to write a book about this this is a big book and you really get into this this is for people I think we really want to know I've written books\nThat deal with a lot of this kind of stuff I wrote a book on miracles I wrote books called everything always wanted to know about God but were afraid to ask that's more than a popular level this really gets into it and this is not to say that this book is difficult to read it's not\nBut it's it's in depth you've been very rigorous ... answering\nA these questions and when did you decide to do this because this is a real work you've got here\nYes well first of all thank you [noise] the the the the the reason I decided to write a\nA book that was comprehensive yeah was because\nThe new atheist claim that they're you know that they're being scientific right that if you believe in God you're a dummy right or you're still clinging to your parents superstitions or you're gullible or you haven't yet been educated enough so\nI started out and actually writing a little bit simpler book\nBut as I got into it I said I I basically bought I better write a book to can stand up the academic ... criticized right because\nI'd met I have friends who have sent their kids to college who took classes in New took classes in religion came out atheists because they're reading all of these\nUm atheist new ideas freeze for and there was nothing that took them on one by one so I read them yeah and there's exceptions in the book I distilled what their question I was in some cases I actually think I made the atheist question sharper that's why western vote\nWell listen I can say I have not read uh in in in their entirety any of those books you referenced I started to read Christopher Hitchens is God is not good I founded on readable mounted so unpleasant\nAnd the arguments so spurious an ad hominem and sloppy and then I could not believed people were taking this book seriously I mean this is a guy Christopher Hitchens\nWas so brilliant and so funny when you want it to be an entertaining but he kinda carries you along with the sound of his voice or with the way that he writes but the content was garbage was stunning to me that people were taking him seriously I thought he he doesn't have any actual arguments here it's all just kind of potshots\nBasically absolutely I mean are they spend a lot of time mocking religion but one thing that I realized which is a core part of my book is that what the new atheist really conflate is they don't understand the difference between ... and I ... and I try to set up and you've done it in your books to actually try to set up what\nTry and I try to set up and you've done it in your books too actually I Try to set up\nWhat I dollar tree is according to the Bible which is\nA set of lies about power it's describing super authority or super force supernatural powers to remind people write beings or ideologies so we thought we a lot of people think we ... dollar tree thirty eight hundred years ago with the God came pharaoh but\nHow did my order thirty ish million people marched to their death because they believed he had the authority to do so how did Stalin sent tens of millions to the gulag starve a quarter of the Ukraine and no one question it\nI mean that's I dollar tree that's not that's that describing the ... definition in the Bible to a person of course Hitler\nAnd but ... pot\nAnd we see it in modern ways very similarly where people ascribe to themselves\nIn a small way to make themselves idle right\nWell it's interesting you you mentioned a Hitler Pol Pot a Stalin and Mao and those are all totalitarian atheist regimes now some people might quibble with that but I have the facts to say that they're and they're quite wrong I mean Hitler was\nAs far from a Christian as you can be in fact if you were any kind of a serious Christian\nOr he would sent you to a concentration camp or have you killed him and his he was at war with the serious Christians within the third Reich and we're making a movie of the story burn off and that's come to the central issue is that if you were just going along and saying well I'm not a Jew so I guess I'm a Christian you were not a Christian you were a gentile who might go to church\nBut the actual Christians were at war with him and he with them and so you have this line running through these I dollar Chris\nTotalitarian regimes that we're all\nMurderous at their core murderous on a level that we can't even imagine and ironically a religion was not the problem atheism was the problem that was the ideology\nLike ... was the problem I mean religion if you consider a dollar tree of former religion which I don't write by ... tree was a problem is a problem it's a problem today it's a problem everywhere and\nWe ignored at our peril and we continue to ignore it at our peril I can let me give you one we're talking about murderous regimes let me talk to you just mentioned one we're sitting here in New York in a studio\nThere we used to be a former ... there was a former attorney general Eric Schneiderman who was um\nYou know at least they went by the moniker of Jewish but she um set themselves up as the law I mean literally as some of your listeners may know he was deposed because of a whole bunch of a sexual abuse allegations in confirmations\nAnd what he did it he said to his victims I'm the top law enforcement official in New York\nYou can't complain to anybody you have to do what I Want you to do he abused his authority right and it goes back in a small way to ... he made himself the gods and when people do that they abuse other people and it no that's not it they don't necessarily murder or other people but they can cause them\n... and so we have to cleanse I think cleansing the the cleansing our relationships that I dollar tree I think\nIs where it on a microwave just to be clear and what I dollar tree is I mean I'm\nI Would say worshipping or anything other than the loving creator God of the Bible ends up being I dollar tree because\nUh only he is worthy of being worship knows only he created the universe only he\nUh uh ... loves us and lives for us and what you don't know there was anything else that you worship whether the state or yourself a lot of atheists\nAre worshipping themselves even though they might not say it but they are so up put off by worshipping God because that impinges on their uh ability to do whatever they like so they have to say there is no God so they end up worshipping themselves anytime you worship anything other than the actual God of the Bible\nUm ... it becomes adultery doesn't it\nYeah well every person is corrupt double\nAnd um we I think a ... not enough attention is given to the real meaning of the way we choose counted the third commandment most Christians kind of the second commandment\nWhich is not to take God's name and then and then to take out St ... shove in Hebrew and it's the only of the ten commandments by the way for which there is no redemption of repentance and says that right and the commandment\nAnd what does that mean to me it means when people set themselves up ... soul spokespeople for God\nAnd we've seen that in history we see it currently whenever anybody says look believe if you don't ... don't believe in me because I mean believe me because I'm the soul I can give you the sole answer to what God wants you can get in the same sort of trouble which is how\n... the a stick religions get in trouble right people say look just listen to me you don't have to go behind the court don't bother reading the scriptures don't bother reasoning for it right all\nRight that that fast and then of course that was the ... the Luther issue I wrote a biography of Martin Luther and it's so fascinating because you realize it at the heart of it he wasn't really a ... all he was doing really was challenging\nThe authority of the church and the pope and saying look you have to bow\nTo a higher authority just as I Do and if you don't do that you have no legitimate authority and they said oh no no you're wrong or we say goes right we are the ultimate authority where the ultimate arbiter of what God says or didn't say you have no right even the question it and at that moment you realized\nThe goose is cooked when you when you have that when you aggregate yourself that kind of power and authority you take the place of God\nWhich is really creepy yes and deadly you've got and that's what Luther\nTried to do and you do an excellent job of showing of of of demonstrating that is to reclaim the Bible would learn the scriptures on your own see what it says you don't have to take the local priests opinion\nIs it that I mean it's a tricky thing right because you don't want to or you don't want to say that everything is subject that whatever your point of view is is valid no no no when I mean we're not saying that and Luther didn't say that right at the same time\nWe do need to take the responsibility to dig in for ourselves and to be careful not to just listen to somebody because they seem like they're right but the but to understand that they are falling human beings as well\nAnd we can't a ... at the end of the day it's between us in God and it's our responsibility when we come back folks will continue the conversation we're talking with Scott Shay S. H. A. Y. the new book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism stick around\n\n[noise]\nPay out and they can I tell you about really factor plays uh no actually I mean can I tell you about it okay you may I may you may well what I'm trying to say I've got somebody even better Oh yes I've got a guy named Alan who's been using relief factor I'd like to hear what he has to save our lead factor here it is\nA ...

with Scott Shane in the studio the book is in good faith questioning religion and atheism a big book with all kinds of interesting stuff in it\nOr we are talking about miracles so the miracles of the accidents supporting the red sea you say Scott than it has a naturalistic explanation you don't say it's not a miracle but you're saying it's a certain kind of miracle so what do you say happened so\nI I again I think that's an important distinction that God can act to nature got connect outside of nature if he so wishes but in the Bible and the Hebrew scriptures\nThe so called the red sea is called yum soup the regency which sort of changed to read see when it got to the bowl gate and this is why I Love studying and ... because of\nCourse is the Latin version correct of the ... is that when St Jerome translated so we're talking three hundred and eighty a hundred percent correct so that ...\nWas before the ... and had a Greek and that actually in many ways it's it we will would even be a um a corroborate or what I'm about to say OK okay of the translations so they were what I Do on page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this where you have to take the\nOne page there three thirty five of my book because I think we have to delve into this way I have to take the criticism seriously well the red sea couldn't apart and well it's actually not the red sea it's there's two lakes that were around at that time right the bottle of lakes and the bitter lakes and if you closely follow\nThe the and I have it on this charge if you closely followed the tracks of the Israel lights including one remember they turn around yeah remember they go for three days and then they turn around and then they end up against some yes some a body of water well it seems like that is um the ... lakes and\nAs late as Napoleon\nThere are discussions sub\nArmies going one direction marching the other way and saying whoa we can't go back to the way there's water why because they're these like do we have there are facts from tidal forces there are read there essentially burying marsh she would never very deep these Barlow in her layers ...\nMarching around Egypt a general\nAnd uh and they encountered this and so you're saying um okay so you're saying there's cooperation so so what are you what are you holding that the that the um [noise] as we've heard that that that a wind blew all night and that it was possible a two part it but it's not as dramatic as it was in for example the ten commandments with Charlton Heston there was nothing like\nThat I Know I mean unfortunately the ten commandments is not actual video footage of the mayor and I know we take it back on\nIts own yeah it can be but I'm sure everybody pressed up against the water praising away to walk maybe it was a little marsh email it was a little ... but I'm sure they viewed it as a miracle narrowed down that\nWay right well see that's what's so interesting is that you know when you talk about what is a miracle a if God's hand was involved in it I mean if you're standing there and there are six million of you and you're about to be killed or whatever by the Egyptian army and suddenly\nHey there's a place to walk where there wasn't a place to walk twenty minutes ago something happened and let's go this way and he was scape and then pharaohs army has drowned in the very place where you to\nMost people would say that as a miracle are now the details of the details and you're you're giving us some more naturalistic explanation I Know a lot of people would disagree with you on all kinds of ah things some would say that the whole thing never happened\nBut it's fascinating I Love this is why I wanted to have you on because\nTalking about this rationally and saying look we first of all we don't have a dog in the fight whatever happened happened we just want to know what is right and a\n... some of the stuff we can know some of the stuff we can speculate on and if we're wrong well eat is what it is you know it's not like it has to be this otherwise my faith crumbles but what you're talking about it's fascinating I I mean I've heard of this before but you you're a you write about an in depth and this book\nAnd I think by taking the tech seriously to and really looking at the words yeah I think there are some things that we take for granted that\nMany believers think that we have to question I think the numbers six hundred thousand Israel a males so I analyze what the word is it's it's ... it's six hundred thousand in in is how it's in is how it's written but when I went back\nAnd spent some time and read a number of a philosopher just review aloof\nAs you may know the Bible or the ...

Israel lights crossing but more like fifty thousand and then if you read closely all of the other counties\nIn the Bible right the number first born which is two hundred and Seventy three groups that are put aside and you look at the winds to make sacrifices are much more comports with fifty thousand I ... into it and you're not always going to come out where you want it bites that I Want to come

like okay what else what else what else uh uh Brian's\nOut this week so that ... day we didn't do any type of did you do a pool last week oh no no we didn't do pull a week wow wow he's\nEven a a you know it just uh\nI just since the lottery fever was out there I just I hadn't mentioned this Fox News had a great article a liberty written by liberty or that hurt the mega millions jackpot and while you're not being told the truth\nNot being told the truth [laughter] yes\nAh in an effort to create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win\nBut have continued to lie to us about the benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense do because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us are Christmas Party and it was\nParty ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us are Christmas Party and it was apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because ... that's not\nTo to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really isn't right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar and all ...\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in the real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line mhm twenty five people there and I just stood up and got no no no you you appear\nWhy am I gonna ... gonna do you're buying alcohol\nNobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that once I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser well the way you know I might as well [laughter] well ... is that going to happen on the second I have on a bench Lee in the pot stores\nUm [laughter]\nI'm Sorry I'm In a ... and everybody's vital nobody's buying pot anymore they're only by the lottery tickets which at that point I said well right now at this moment in time gambling seems to be a worst vice and drinking what was the only one by liquor it\nWell they said Seventy percent played in the eighties but I don't think our state had it in the eighties okay and and\nI guess everybody Seventy percent of those that have the lottery\nThat he was hanging out [laughter] it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the\nMid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story\nOn the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says cause show he's killing was premeditated will take out the owners of a bakery who of appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that\nCame out we never got a chance to talk about it a lot of uh you yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talk about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues that may be affecting what's going on in the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar now worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers yeah farmers are happy because of the terrorists you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the care of and and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum\nTariffs you think about that if I'm going to put them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah and in\nThe mid west there are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you think you're right in and come up with a formula as to what's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lot of time on and also the Republican side for what could hurt the Democrats in what could hurt the Republicans because there are things out there that could hurt the Republicans in this election that more coming up plus your calls and comments eight

weeks now well it will be ... it will be two weeks from right now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that uh has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that a whole okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles standing well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even close\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey and the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island and then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio\nA good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nWhere there have been significant amounts of rainfall and flooding over the past week\nLook for the possibility of some white snow flurries up along the great lakes region mainly near upstate New York as high pressure stairs and cooler Canadian air and moisture from the south collide your national forecast ... radio I'm meteorologist job trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nA orange and we're not talking the super rich more I learned about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now\nThere's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote it\nHas the potential of changing five percent of the boat yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nJust the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that may bud perch that is they're coming on bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRather than we're in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change do small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us write the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that there are still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said dare I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] right\nAnd and ah the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's an unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about Ford grumbling gonna be allusion a billion dollars mhm they believe the terrorists are going to the are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every moment in the steel tariffs really been affects we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that\nAutomobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of tariffs caused and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and\nThen the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you started wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though it was a wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now as\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada ah any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war chair of the that went into place\nA or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nIt's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're a or out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us a decade\nNow we don't know when we're going to get back in ... took us deck I think one of the coach was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty is a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand named to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the golfers well they've made all the banks look risky\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the ... the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I I think uh\nAnalysis of of the issues affecting this mid term ... eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... on the
