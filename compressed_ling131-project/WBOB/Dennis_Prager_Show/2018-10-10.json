B. O. B. um\n[noise]\n[laughter] ladies and gentlemen I'm not doing as much access to the center for you told me my own and I'm not even broadcasting from a studio I'm sitting in the refrigerator box in my garage once in a hurry up the ... the new in the car\nMissouri money mass themselves much access to all the while I\nYou know that really makes me feel guilty I I'm not treating Todd right\nWhen I really need to do is fire him because this is this is unacceptable album please make note of that hey folks today a well everyday I talk about religious freedom on this program don't I I think I Do just about every single day I I usually mentioned the alliance defending freedom a and I'm asking folks to uh\nTo help them or help Americans are with religious liberty cases I thought would it be great to get somebody from the alliance defending freedom who's in the middle of these battles tremendous battles often with the U.S Supreme Court\nOn the issue of religious liberty something that we understood as a nation but have ceased to understand so now we have to have big court cases are and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom I don't know how people like Jack Philips of master Kate masterpiece\nA hate shop and others are would defend themselves they wouldn't be able to defend themselves the lines of an agreement stepping up so I wanted to talk to a demand sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for ... just laid of advocacy at the alliance defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me\nWell listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I eat just last week a mentioned that on air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nYeah absolutely so ... Thomas is a mother and Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy uh\nAnd so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of adopting these policies in schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I have in my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the ... elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district policy made this possible it was a past sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect\nThe desires of the child and the ... in this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom it's a young boy identify the gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a sexual nature\nOr do we how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade as Pashtuns daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has some issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but as we Lincoln who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies and indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine\nWhether that there's a better accommodations we can that we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nWent to access show and we're talking with massive sharp who's a senior counsel for the\nAlliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty um met I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding about religious liberty\nOr in America why do you think it is that what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago is certainly an issue an alliance defending freedom has to step up\nAnd be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this has definitely been a growing trend within the past two years and I think it's a couple of things one I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance of religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage him and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people look at it and say oh that's just something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American\nWell I guess the other oh no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these belief you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we much to drive it out and punish you for even holding such if\nWell um I think your ear right in saying these things and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight if you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote you better get your friends to vote\nAnd you'd better if you can give to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us in a country that demonize as people of faith as bigoted now again you know I always want to be clear\nThis is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up\nFor everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem to think that biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that suddenly\nA there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are or the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand the basics here that when we\nYour stand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want to anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here\nThe government can't take sides on issues that touch on the fault amid questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is a man what does a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed out of this but suddenly now we're having the government\nForcing views on Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned that um met with this ... Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all the might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing of view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty\nOf people who have traditional values so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these had games that they say a I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know the it's now incumbent\nOn your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who are either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that [noise]\nThat's right and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even enforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to\nGo local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and how they're changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you if people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say all the people listening to me right now if this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy\nOr ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government or whatever it is get involved at least vote folks at least vote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of of radical\nI'm a ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party\nOf Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream are are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine\nIdentified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where\nWe have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fundraiser for alliance defending freedom or if you want to or Ken\nI'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks\nUp put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just awful and it's ridiculous and is destroying America so you can go to our website ... attacks us talk dot com ma taxes talked outcome if you'd rather call I've got a phone number for you it is eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy then you don't ... I Know that there are people out there thinking all the Arabs is is fear mongering uh\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know play to people's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just think like well everything will be fine but everything will be fine and everything is not find if it weren't for you and the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her and the whole school system is telling her\nHey you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girl is a result of all this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy um but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just ... and her daughter\nNot just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that and have a physically strong\nMail whether it's the same age or older ah but but attack them or something like that that you shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's a situation we don't know the details but uh it seems\nThat it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about\nTeenage kids and it it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have unless reason prevails and unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have folks like the lines defending freedom defending these ideas\nOr you know what's happening folks um I'm going to tell you again please uh we're we're doing\nA a fundraiser lines of an extreme

Would I was saying that I I Want to mention that so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what ... was asked to do\nWas disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this is this was absolutely foul sexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and was wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court\nOtherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become as a nation what have we become\nAs a nation we once believed\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans\nWhen you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial like this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror a light on us and we looked at ourselves in a in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think is a country we need to change our laws but we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute foul illness absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak Philips has not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the lines of freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks you need to understand this is an existential\nFor the soul of this country we need to vote we need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this\nShould have been thrown out I mean nobody should have to take that seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously in the eyes defending freedom has to defend them um I mean this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with the when the civil rights commission but it just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks case against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him\nContinue to operate as a business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that um your average American really would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting a civil war when we were finding the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight a and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do as I said his vote\nA please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't are so many people have such excuses please if you don't vote don't ever complain again\nA and I want to say uh if you can give to the audience defending freedom I don't know\nAnybody that is doing this kind of work right now I saw I Want to say go to ... talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny ... will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values or where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn to the audience defending freedom so the number in

will be a historic storm\nA in terms of the damage and the size of the storm\nOr it will then move inland with a ton of rape while we were talking during the pre ... meeting\nAs it moves through uh the uh the the panhandle of Florida and then goes into north north easterly direction toward the Carolinas that's going to be dumping a lot of rain the Carolinas ... they're saying it will move faster than Florence so it won't present the same problems\nBut the problem is with the areas affected by Florence that are already saturated the ground is already saturated then of course any rain at all is going to cause problems and they will be getting rain in those areas in the coming days\nUh but uh more immediately we're looking at a at a the panhandle of Florida and Panama City essentially a being the target right now for hurricane Michael and\nWhen you see wins over a hundred and thirty miles an hour if it's a a category for they say would be the biggest a hurricane ever to hit the uh the panhandle I'm a ... when I when I Lived in Nevada or Florida when I Lived in the Fort Walton Beach Pensacola area back in the eighties\nEverybody's still talked about Camille ... you know Biloxi though in a little bit further down\nThe coast that hit five right ah and you know the if if you've ever seen any of the documentaries on on Camille you you know how how bad it can be when you have a hurricane of\nOf of that strength of you have a hurricane that that hits the Gulf Coast at a hundred and thirty miles an hour\nTo the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I it's we've been talk show hosts too long we just\nWe could we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated they are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're\nA UN ambassador you have to you have you know the national\nSecurity advisor to be effective in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or relaying\nA mess and and Bolton says the same thing you know because when when they asked him\nWell you know a fight or a [laughter] heads on John Hope [laughter] John Button\nWas asked that he's he's always as easy as I said oh look when when you were ... when you were ah you know when you were whatever uh uh ... five years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point did I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president and I disagree right I get invited vice what he does a lot of it is on the national security advisor advisor they find that if I was there we roll white I tell him what did I tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it\nAnd then when he says let's go and do it but then I tell you what the plan is that the the president and\n\nGoing through this because everybody knows that already well ... but do they in a nation where they can't name the three branches of government well no you know I think the reporters do it because they want to they they're trying to find\nAnything to show that there is discord within the administration [noise] yes yes it is ...\nAnd they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier and I I think to your point the earlier point you may as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her her spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nAh in that position as strong as she has been when she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going to Iraq some noise you know I don't think ... point so anybody on those lists could be you know just to strongest stronger as as she's been and\nI trust the president now or maybe not the first year so much but I trust the president now and also trust the situation and we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency\nWe talked about how people who were going to work with him or either on staff or in the cabinet\nWouldn't know what they were in for [laughter] after that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their\nPerspective we have a busy and great show ahead we do eight six six Ninety

currently you know just a very quickly we we do have a hurricane\nComing up appalling the bottom of the hour with meteorologist Tom hale he will uh uh join us but uh you you know you make a great point when you talk about the fact that\nWhen you're talking about you and I think both of us had made I made a fair point you made a great point uh but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for I was making the analogy to you is almost like an NFL quarterback you don't have an NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like oh they stink phone I really really good and we as I mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nThat that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like but if you would have told me when and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went [noise]\nNo I just don't think she has it right away it was I wrong\n[noise] you know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore\nOr ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John Bolton you know you pretty much know where you're going to get with the John Bolton but otherwise\nAh there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for a not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course\nA what the president expects\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nUh that are going to be affected by this storm a you as you can imagine especially everything pretty much east of mobile on I can\nIs going to be affected uh uh and uh it could be for a number of days so know that uh when you're going in and there's going to be a lot of staging in fact in that area\nOf ah trucks that are loaded with generators and water and all kinds of supplies that will be going into Florida won the storm passes and the conditions are safe to get that stuff and\nUh but uh we just want to remind you that uh that\nThat is going to be very treacherous for the coming days and the foreseeable future at least I Would say over the next several days into the weekend we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale get an update on hurricane Michael next [noise]\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at\nYou know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be offshore and it will be properly ... bill a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now\nI may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore and so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee bites Thursday evening it shouldn't be entering the Carolina\nAnd cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast\nAnd then they don't need any more destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour\nOr when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning\nBut on Wednesday today\nOr we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour and a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour [noise] or when we get to\nA coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation [noise] ah from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City\nSix to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so when it comes in if it comes in to the east the winds are going to be backing so it will reduce that effect but you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola [noise]\nAh we're looking at a storm surge that will run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet while yeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\nAnd yeah and and and\nSo we're talking about a ... again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI the storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average fifty miles an hour through\nWednesday night they're going to have and Gus Wednesday night or as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain so\nInland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event and that range gotta go somewhere and uh and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge [noise]\nUm then from there then you start dealing with the rain on top of that and so we saw that in New Bern a newborn on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up\nThe Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet and and we had the we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the\nUh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues um that night while\nWhile I'm it again or you know I there's this\nShould go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are in the path of this storm need the heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm a Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned\nThat we're going to see in some places maybe to twelve inches of rain\nUm the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of warrants because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee and then from there when we move across the border into Georgia [noise]\nWe're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas and I can pull up some maps and break that out\nUm next time we taught bitterly that the fact of the matter is that it only takes you know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right\nAnd we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place ... well the difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas\nAlong the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nYeah All right and and and when when you expected to onshore\nI expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay hum this afternoon they're All right\nAll right meteorologists Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they on standing coverage for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma\nAnd uh with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to make sure that uh everyone knows we're going to be on this for you this morning and tomorrow morning thank you trauma greatly appreciate it will talk to you in just a bit\nLook forward to it thank you uh we will law again also be checking in with our meteorologist the John trap a next hour I get an update from from him a and a as we go through the morning any updates also from officials\nAre in Florida or the national weather service will bring those and we do have a another Fifteen minutes we will have the national Hurricane Center ...\nLatest report that basically the the cone yeah and you look look at what Tom was saying and he's expecting a that this could be that could upgrade the storm to a category for hurricane\nAh with this next report that's coming out here and just a bit and we will go over that with Tom the next time we talk to them and we'll be doing that later in the in the program as well and again meteorologist John trout on board as well to give us a\nHis latest a
