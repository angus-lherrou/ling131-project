Elton John so his wife evidently invited these people and so they bring her over and I meet wife burning top I'm about to me because this is really like\nThat to people to know who he is it doesn't get\nMadison Square garden we typically don't have church there but I Want to tell you I'm not only is he a pastor longtime pasture in Dallas but he's the author of many books to Fox News contributor the new book is called choosing the extraordinary life dodge seven secrets\nFor success and significant who doesn't want to have an extraordinary life I Know I Do and I'm thrilled to have a dog or Dr Robert Jeffress on the line doctor Jeffress welcome\nGod good to talk to you Eric thanks for having me\nWell first of all you know when when you write a book like choosing the extraordinary life everybody is longing for meaning in life and I and I think most people they kind of hit a rut I Know I did and you wonder is this shit what ... what am I doing with my life wonder why\nOr why am I on this planet a lot of times people even Christians\nAre their face a it hasn't really gotten a hold of them and they're kind of just [noise] or maybe they are paid has gotten a hold of them but they're still sort of lost and so whenever I see a book like this I kind of get excited because we need to know\nUh the answer these questions so so what are you saying the book and you say seven secrets for success and significance what do you mean by that\nWell let me tap into what you just said you know so many Christians right now we're kind of like that Chicago's sewer worker who was asked why he did what he did he said well let me think I dig the ditch to earn the money to buy the bread to get the strength to dig the ditch\n[laughter] you know that a lot of people\nAre living their lives they get up go to work come home eat dinner watch TV go to bed and start to routine all over again right and I thank God really has more force than that and what I talk about\nThe extraordinary like this is not a positive thinking mumbo jumbo book actually based this book on the life of a wide shot you know a lot of the Bible says it was an ordinary person\nHe had the same doubts ballots would disobedience in discouragement that we do and yet ... used in in an extraordinary way and his culture and what I've done is I've unveiled the seven choices allied you made in his life that led to an extraordinary life\nAnd the you know there's something up an extraordinary like happens when we find are unique life purpose and find out can next to God's purpose and I used the seven very practical secrets that help us to do just that\nWell it's interesting that you're you're writing about ... because he he experienced great uh despondency a in his life I mean whether it was depression or just being but just broken at his which end and uh God has to kind of book came up I think a lot of times people do go through the end they we can always ...\nAnd then to God has to kind of book came up I think a lot of times people do go through them then we can always relate to a to him under the broom tree I guess\nThat's right in fact that's one of the chapters of the one of the secrets\nOf an extraordinary life is learning how to handle bad days\nWe all had bad days are bad seasons of lie point discouragement piles upon discouragement\nAnd I noticed the secret is not how to avoid that day were simple people living in a simple world we're going to make some bad choices around some bad choices made for us we can't avoid bad seasons of life but we can learn how to handle them without allowing them to paralyze us and that's one of those things we look at an allied ships life\nWhether it's almost funny to think about the day under the broom tree is a bad day I mean it was [laughter] it was very bad it was extremely bad he actually bring your your pastor so you know this stuff explain to us\nWhat brought him to that place in the relationship with jazz a bell and and that whole thing because we're talking about his real bad\nAnd the ... the high point of his life was on Mount Carmel you know we've been there before where a logic that battle with the profits of bail an Asher a slew the profits in the fire fell down from heaven and then he went into a fun\nI mean part of it was probably emotional spiritual exhaustion\nAnd he lost perspective Eric and it's interesting you know in one moment he couldn't be phased by eight hundred angry profits of bail\nBut in the next moment when he was emotionally depleted all it took was one angry female language has a bell to come after him and he started running and he ran and ran and as you know he ended up under the tree and said you know lord take my life\nNow we know we didn't mean that he really wanted to die he could have stayed right where he was in ... by word of a comment to them but he lost perspective and I talk about in that chapter he mirrors for us you know what to do during these bad seasons of life you know we need to take care of ourselves physically my old professor Howard hindered said\nSometimes the most spiritual thing you can\nDo is take a nap and then to maintaining that did\nNot read the Bible sometimes you just need to take a nap a you know eight to remember the angels brought the case too and that's the first instance of angels food cake in the\n... [laughter] anyway so he restored\nHimself physically he also a risk for himself\nSpiritually there is a great verse about king David after he had a particularly bad day and all of the homes of his people were a barn than the people were grumbling about him\nThe Bible says David strengthened himself and the lord we need to know how to strengthen ourselves spiritually and interestingly\nA God minister tournament mostly a larger was hiding in that cave in God's ... after a period of time it's time to leave the cave and get reconnected to people you know as a pastor I find this all the time Eric when people were going through a bad season and life\nWill say a pastor a hope you understand but we're just won't take some time off from church we're having a hard time right now we just need some time off\nOur friend David Jeremiah says the only person who thinks\nYou ought to take some time off from church when you're going through difficulty is the devil I mean his strategy is to isolate Christians and to attack them so I just a great model on how to handle those bad days that's just one of the secrets we talk about in choosing the extraordinary life what\nIt is it's so important I think a ... especially if we're talking to our fellow Christians to say you can be way too spiritual sometimes and people forget that there's a time to eat and to sleep and to rest and to laugh\nAnd to hug her kids were to play ball and and I think sometimes the biggest spiritual battle a comes as you just said because we're depleted and we have an elected those things and some people think maybe there's honor in not\nTaking care of myself the less I sleep more spiritual am I'm a praying or something like that and you think well you better be careful because because God wants us to be arrested and to be refreshed and that really that's such a big wants a big one for me I have to say\nYeah and you know are we ever remember we're body soul and spirit God created all three components to make us who we are and you know it's a mystery really how all of that inter relate to one another but I Know this you know they were so closely tied to each other you know the body the soul and spirit is somebody said if one catches a cold the other sneezes\n[laughter] I'm not I'm not heard this I think you have to be a preacher to have heard all these kind of cool things you just kind of a mountain a sermon but I I like that and it's it's really true I I find that I have been able to be attacked or spiritually when I have allowed myself\nTo get tired or somehow depleted that I'm more I'm a more open uh\nTo to to just falling into whenever a bad place emotionally or anything like that in sleep a and eating in and laughing and giving ourselves a break sometimes because I Do think sometimes people confuse\nThe walk of face with this kind of testing it out white ... like that that to take care of yourself\nOr is this thin and and I think no on the country that's a ... if the lord loves us he wants us to take good care of ourselves take good care of our bodies and our minds and and that that's just a big one so I just I'm Glad that uh we got to that when you're talking about ... under the broom treat\nA it really is funny too because he has just come off of such a high and isn't that another thing that when when you've been through something fantastic right after that often can be a very very down time and that's a classic case\nAbsolutely perfect illustration\nAnd there's also another crude illustrated there that we talk about and that's waiting on God's timing you know a large I had a big splashy came on the scene really out of nowhere and first came Seventeen made his big pronouncement the evil King I have it's not going to rain and then got sending off for three and a half years in obscurity\nAnd you know a lie to hit really I think thought God was finished with him he spent six months alone by the work carrots and then two years with a widow\nAnd yet during that waiting time God taught alive just some in valuable things you know we want to move from one big thing to the next big thing from a big failure to a big success\nMini gods calls a time out and I say in this chapter waiting on God's timing waiting time doesn't have to be wasted time if we're learning the lessons God wants us to learn\nBecause many times God's not only working in our life he's working someplace else we can't even sit the terrorists for our next big thing and so really to learning to wait on God is another secret for an extraordinary life\nWhile I

time when you know God's Plan but then you have to decide whether you're going to follow that plan you know if this will be ... probably sound funny to you but I thought I knew from the time I was about five years old what I was going to do\nFrom the time I was five Fifteen I thought I was going to be a TV producer is on TV\nWhen I was five and I get more so interested in what was going on behind the camera\nI mean I used to the library Eric when I was eight or nine my parents were brought me off at the Dallas library to do my homework\nAnd instead of doing that I'd pull pull down every broadcasting a journal I couldn't read I Would pull down Forbes magazine back issues and read them I mean I was fascinated with the business aspect of broadcasting so when I was Fifteen God spoke to me as clearly as he ever spoke to me\nAnd said you're going to be a pastor\nNow what's interesting is God really didn't change my interest and gifted and is he just three directed them to a new way of serving him and I think again what I Would say the listeners the reason you're interested in that things are interested in is not by accident\nAgain we have this idea that God's will be the most the\nTaste for most unpleasant thing we could ever think of okay I'm going to surrender and go to Africa and live in a hot\nNow you know why people who are missionaries go to Africa or China or wherever and live as missionaries it because that's what they want to do right they would be miserable doing anything else God uses desires and passions and gifts to give you his direction\nFull that there there's so much a in just this now I'm just curious because it's so humorous to me so at age five you said you were on TV and and the TV production bug beat you at age ... that's very funny most five year olds\nDon't even know what TV production is I I just discovered about three years ago myself what the heck production is how is it that first of all you do it on TV at age five\nOh I hate to tell you I was playing my accordion on the Mr ... show the big show we're in\nThe Dallas Fort Worth area 'cause I was kind of a similar semi regular on the mystery that permit\nTo that is so cute I

that available on YouTube that the cutest thing I've ever tried to\nKill or trying to find and destroy all copies that may be an exist\nThat is so cute I cannot even believe that at age five you were doing that that to al ... and what what's the song you played\nA downtown I think\nThat [laughter] so cute I cannot get over it that it's incredible\nI Want to see this but so you were your parents obviously pushed you to do this or or or it allowed you to do this and you you did it and you're telling me that oh did he do more TV after that it was at it\nYeah yeah I did I did more I did that kind of you know growing up and then I started ... and uh make my money go into high school and college doing weddings and bar mitzvah was and everything else you got played in some places I probably shouldn't have played and\nYou know it's just yeah I can I can play bearable broken make tears come to under [laughter]\nWell I Know the accordingly huge in the sixties and and a lot of kids play the accordion it's not ... you don't see too many kids do that today but you're telling me you are on the Mr peppermint show I we didn't have that where I grew up so I'm just I'm kind of jealous that I've seen it sounds so cute but so you something about that\nKind of got into you and what I find interesting too when you talk about the way God makes people you didn't think oh I Want to be on TV you thought I don't want to be a TV producer weight that just an amazing thing for a little kid to be thinking about that\nAnd and you know again the idea of broadcasting that's very important part of our

our neck in neck in the contest to build a retired Republican Jeff Blake's\nA Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and the ... group as other in the NBC News soon or a partisan analytics\nIn Florida where a democratic Bill Nelson who's running for reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott\nForty four percent\nOf the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent of the Democratic affiliation an Eighteen percent\nWho are not affiliated with either party in Indiana\nWe're democratic Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenged from Mike Braun fifty one percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation and ten percent who are not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just the voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans and emerge mid term election like that that's almost unheard\nOf well especially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they take a look at that as it because people are\nChomping at the bit to devote to to get there say and who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something about the the\nPoint I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but if you have is you know if ten percent or in the one case was at a in Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls on were independence live right now\nOur independence being affected by what has gone out now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings\nWhich may be a huge uh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election\nI haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence\nWe've heard a lot about the enthusiasm Republicans and Democrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country's going mhm and I just haven't seen much\nI'll I'll just do more research on it now yeah I'm going to do some more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spend so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are are not realizing that a significant portion\nThe the determining factor of votes in most states is still you know the where the independence lie mhm\n[noise] yeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess not independence but undecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me I'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls because\nYou go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh\nThat that's something very different though I mean it's it's something that because people will make this this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nAn any given race and it's crucial dust I think that it's the job of the pollsters to to show those numbers as close to an election days you can but\nYou know again ah they haven't been as active as they were in years past than you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week\nWhat we know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble and the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that just started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states\nYou know when we're talking about Pennsylvania and and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's where they saw some of the change at that point mhm and they said oh\nAnd you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally because they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point 'cause we are just two weeks out now so for the last week especially if you went inside most political parties and say ... what is your polling showing you're going to have one or another say\nThe momentum is moving our way or isn't moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment\nYou know what we know afterwards yeah because the the ... the analyze you know what happened in a particular\nYou know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election but it's what's happening right now and the internal polls are probably showing that but when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks\nSome even more than four weeks out what was going on in September\nIs not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now\nRight yeah I mean it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but but ultimately you have to get down to those poles and\nAnd where those numbers come back but but ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not going to see you know a a I guess an onslaught of those polls leading up to that a leading up to election day or two weeks from today by the way\nSo um but the early voting\nOn Texas and Florida a you know will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a work\nAnd and cruise cruise the latest polls has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls or by seven points you're so and they are CPS average he's up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last two polls so\nYou know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago\nAssuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a you know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nAnd if you look at it that the last poll for the uh was I don't have it here in front of me the last poll for or a rock and Cruz was a week ago\nThat yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate does yeah yeah that's and and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the pre show meeting I said you know because\nI Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one or later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and\nUm you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls but they probably won't be as numerous\nAs what we've seen and and um the last month or two we\nHave a line open if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety read
