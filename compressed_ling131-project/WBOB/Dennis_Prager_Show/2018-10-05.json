we have an important show I have an important guest or in the studio his name\nIs David Limbaugh but David I'm going to need to see some ID because a lot of people claim to be related to Rush Limbaugh and I'm not going to believe every Tom Dick and Harry that walks in here are you really a brother of has a sibling of some kind\nYes when I Do go to the family reunions these distant cousins come up and say I'm related to us and all of that right now I Want to talk about rough\nI Love the idea that even his own relatives can't say rush out well nobody's ever been named brushed before rush but that wasn't a year younger or older than Russia younger you're younger you know what I was just going to say how come you look so much healthier and younger than your brother\n[laughter] because you are younger than he had exactly and it's just a kid ... year his kid either of your kid brother okay well ah look\nUh the reason you're here is not because you're related to Rush Limbaugh although congratulations on that very few people achieve that in their lifetime lights that it's not an easy because I tried for a while and then I'd rather just not going to happen but um\nBut you've written a book you've written so many wonderful books and here I'm holding in my hand another one the title of it he's Jesus is ribs and\nPaul and the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian author you have to use you dove into this thing almost like you believe the\nYeah the out a interesting I've always so enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does that was one of\nThat when I asked my point snow but you know what I Want to know seriously you are you you said is on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how did you you're a lawyer how did you come to faith what happened\nI it was a skeptic as you miss\nYou come to faith what happened I it was a skeptic as you mentioned and but I was a seeker I I always believe in God but I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace Jesus Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that\nAnd um I finally started studying reading apologetic books Paul Little um you know Josh meant dal Norman guys are and finally a overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later place my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I don't understand how anyone can think that there isn't a Colorado and Romans one I don't understand you know you look at the creation you look at the ... are you looking at everything I Know the cynics can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand [laughter]\nBut but embracing the Bible was a little difficult than what I didn't realize is that people had placed\nSeeds in my path all along on when I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little things that if they hadn't happened if God in his Providence hadn't put people in my path dropping those seeds I may not have become a Christian of course I was always destined to be one because God I don't mean I'm\nNot as you because you believe in their predestination guard I actually don't move on and you know whatever whatever I don't wanna get into that but but usually you ... I I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many kids were in your family just rushing off\nJust un Russell you [laughter] can I call him or us for a un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart for you to have you now this is beyond this have you always been two years apart yes it's amazing you see that's very rare\nIt is that's very very rare of fluids ... latest that it was just the two boys you all you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and\nUh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday oh yeah yeah we were raised in Methodist Church in what in what a part of the state what part of the country or southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nNo no no no and my parents were Christians and and I I I just not like I was cynical about it I just I had trouble with it I didn't understand how it was fair and all that\nBut but what I was going to tell you a minute ago when you so rudely got me yes I always try to cut people off rudely otherwise what's the point yeah ... what was that I hadn't really given the chance it's like okay so I'm passing judgment on a thing that affects my eternal life\nThe great Keith Richards\nA who's had many blood transfusions at fifty thousand dollars a pop but we can't get into that now because I'm sitting here with the brother of Rush Limbaugh David Limbaugh book your book is just a beautiful book\nFor many reasons but the title a Jesus is ribs and that is you you realize that that title alone is a kind of spiritual warfare when you declare Jesus has risen the demons\nTremble that's a fact uh the subtitle is Paul in the early church the demons do not Trumbull at the subtitle but uh\nBut it's just so great that you're writing all of these books but I Want to get back to your story because I Love the idea\nThat you are very rationally you're a lawyer and he got the point in life we for some reason and and listen let's be honest it was probably your wife's prayers for you because she knew that if you did not become a Christian she was in ...\nFor having married you so she had to prove that somehow she knew ... of knowledge that you'd be Christian otherwise she's in trouble right\nAnd we wouldn't raise their kids in an overall Christian home what right\nWe do not exactly a good thing so ... says she's praying for you and I suspect strongly actually that that's part of the reason you're you're a thoughts began to focus as they did although who knows right on\nBut I just love the fact that you dug into this to see if it's really true but you live in a culture and I live in a culture where unless you're hanging out with Jesus freaks you believe this stuff\nMost people are very happy floating along they don't even say they're seekers they're not seekers they're floating along I think kind of\nWanting it not to be true because uh it it might be their lives might have to change or something like that\nLike there's no question about it that are intellectual doubts are sometimes masks for other issues that we have in our life whether it's wanting to continue to sin I'm not talking about ... major sin murdering people or something whether it's drinking too much whatever\nThat that you whatever lifestyle you want to engage in\nA in so it might be a deterrent and you and it might be a deceitful thing where you think this is intellectual now there are some intellectual issues\nBut I don't think that's ultimately what keeps people from believing I think Christianity is based on solid evidence overwhelming evidence actually and and it's based in reason but faith and read and and so faith and reason are compatible but they're not the same thing and you you ultimately take a leap of faith with just a matter of the will\nBut in my case I had to overcome my so called intellectual obstacles before I Would allow myself to take that step\nBut but state by its own definition require something more than just the uh the rational thought you can't argue someone into the kingdom because it is a matter of the will and some people are are are ...\nOne into the kingdom because it is a matter of the will and some people are are are predisposed to dispose against it or their mindset is against the war will be thing and um\nYou can argue with the what you can discuss things with them you can show them how they're some of their doubts are not grounded in reason right uh and that we have affirmative evidence to show how Christianity makes more sense than anything else but you can't ultimately get them to take the leap\nI think it's interesting because I I Would say a lot of people say you know faith is a leap in the dark and I I've always disagreed with that I've said faith is a leap in the light because good when you're leaving something that is actually true it's like saying [noise] I don't know this one plus one equals to thing I just I'm not convinced and it's like\nIt doesn't matter whether you're convinced it is true so when you leap\nTo grab onto one plus one equals to you're grabbing out of something that is true and not to grab onto it is really to be foolish but the point is that even something as simple as one plus one equals two on some level requires an act of the will to accept it and and to accept\nFace I've always said I'm\nAnybody knows I mean I've written a book on miracles but the ultimate miracle is conversion why because there is no way a human being can come to believe\nIn the God of the Bible apart from the grace of God you know his kind of like Lazarus is a rotting corps he didn't do anything to sit up\nGod did it All right and so it's not like we're sick and we're in in need of all of a little medicine to feel better we're corpses in need of resurrection and face is just like that when somebody goes from not believing to believing\nSomehow God has to be involved and that's the this is the huge mystery so you're right I mean I've done the same thing I've written books and apologetic and stuff that you're trying to help people along because it's not like that's not important but at the end of the day\nIt's prayer and it's God and so that they're to me that's the mystery you know like why did this happen to you when it happened 'cause you could have just kept drifting\nNo question but when you look back and when you remember that people like a a friend of a friend who was visiting a ... from his law school my friend and he both with law school in Texas they were visiting over Christmas I was um we went to my friend's\nParents' home started talking and randomly Christianity came up that wouldn't come up and my ordinary conversation and Steve Springer my friend's friend who was with him it was a cool guy cool guys aren't Christian especially not then there are a lot of them now right but in why if we would have been caught dead at those nerdy things excuse me what is in way of\nMethod is youth foundation or what they do something like that yeah maybe that's not what it is I didn't even know and then I Know what it was\nWhatever it is was on cool man\nYeah and it's so ... so a Steve is talking about it\nAnd I'm kind of making fun of it in a non non smart all the way but I wasn't very charitable he's he's a cool guy all the girls loving Christian Girls can't be but but now he goes into his bedroom and is where he was staying at his friends my friends' parents\nAnd brings back a Bible in any started showing me reference by how members if I'd ever seen the rivers Bible I didn't wreck noted for showing how\nOld Testament passages are tied the New Testament how New Testament in Old Testament are internally integrated I'm tell you a light went off right there and\nAh he also was very patient with me uh in in ... and told me about Jesus in his lab and everything I kinda filed that than later Twenty years later I'm maybe ten years later whatever it was he came back to visit my friend Peter\nTender and I said bring him over he came to my house\nI he I was a Christian then I went to my library got the Bible that he'd given me came back on the guy got really emotionally couldn't believe that I that that had such an impact on I'm telling you without that pivotal piece I may not have become a Christian I'm not saying it was random by the way I think it was super intended by God course you know what\nI think it moved in so much he wanted to talk about it in his church back in Texas a and I asked my permission if you could give his testimony and talk about that [noise]\nI Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening and this is not for other people is this for you it's either true or it's not and if it's true\nBy the way it can only bless you there are people I think they have this fear is comparison me it's going to make me live that that is absolute garbage I Want to date that clearly that is garbage\nIf you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into weird person if you want to be ... percent but honestly\nIf you want to be who you are supposed to be you know if you want to get to your grave\nUh always wondering who am I really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank the cars and go anywhere without gas on the tank and I I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you\nTo say honestly the idea that this is scary in some way is a total why\n... and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the books\nBut I think some some of this pre Christian had this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regiment of the robotic they don't they don't live a robust life\nAnd if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't want to hang around with because you've Baskins in enjoy just because they're they're not happy people some of them do kind of I'm not so there are a bunch\nOf ... I I Know I can give you named after the show\nOkay [laughter] but but what I didn't understand until later and I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you a liberty Paul talks about I'm ... ... it'll set you free ... believe in Christ in such for what okay here's here's the answer that paradox\nBefore you become a Christian\nYou are a slave to send it is your master I don't mean that kind of sin you're a terrible person all we're all the prey but I'm not in just a vernacular labor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person may be a very nice for it\nBut you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his it has dominion over over you when you accept Christ is your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that doesn't that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these ... does that mean I'm Free to send\nKnow emphatically no it means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you been out of love and the ... you want to even raise yourself to a higher standard of morality\nOr out of obedience and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not down to you're not living under arbitrary not are not living under the the set of rules they transcend that crisis goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a beating and you're no longer a slave descent\nCalled payout Ben Hey Eric I have told me about really factor recently please do may I may I because I take really factor every day if you've

think he should try what you can okay where at least factors one of those things that the reason I recommend it to all my friends\nIs that it's non toxic it's not like taking Advil or some weird
