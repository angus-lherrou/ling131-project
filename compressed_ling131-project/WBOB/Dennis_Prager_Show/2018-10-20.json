I wanted to get him on again but this time with his client a man who is now\nA sexually famous in the world of religious liberty jak Philips a the owner of master piece of cake shop in Colorado I have them both on the line thrilled to have you both on the line gentlemen welcome to the program\nHow welcoming glad to be here they travel is\nYeah I I gotta say a ... thanks to to both of you met your there too right yes I Am yeah well listen uh ... this program I Am I my audience knows that we're doing a a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom because you guys do everything you do for free and everything is at stake but I'm really excited\nTo have both of you on but there's a lot of times you know somebody like you jak saltier name you're out there people understand\nYour real guy just like everybody else you're a small business owner your normal person I have met you and it you know we forget that what is happening in America that to people who have basic biblical values is crazy it's absolutely crazy tapping the folks like you in fact\nTo you and so I Want to talk about uh the Supreme Court victory and I want to talk about the more reach into trouble or that are that we've had so maybe I'm jak you could just describe if you would uh what happened way back when when this couple came into your\nInto your shop and asked you to bake a cake to create something not just to sell a cake but to create something for same sex wedding ceremony\nStarted or six years now in July of two thousand twelve Thursday Afternoon to German Bakery and asked me to create a wedding cake for their same sex slave\nCritics for same sex weddings they were surprised you're forty you know to the shop other historic cookies brownies or just ...\nFor a short story was simply that the country\nWell okay so we have to be clear because I always want to educate my my audience so we understand these things if somebody goes into a hardware store and says I Want to buy hammer\nAnd the person who was a hardware store says using the gay I don't want to sell you the hammer get outta my store I hate gays or maybe uses an even more ... term for gays every buddy in America would agree that is not okay if\nIt's every buddy in America would agree that is not okay\nIf you have a store and you're selling hammers you got us all hammers to everybody it's none of your business ... what they are what are you know but we're not talking about that we're not talking about a lunch counters refusing to serve a hamburger or to black customers we're not talking about that we are talking about somebody\nComing to you and saying I Want you to Korea I Want you to use the artistic skills\nTo help us celebrate something that we think is really beautiful and should be celebrated and at that point you say well this is complicated because you're not asking me to sell you a sheet cake for birthday you're asking me to create something\nAnd to enter into a celebration of something that because of my faith that can't celebrate now let's be clear you don't celebrate Halloween you know there's a lot of things that you as a Christian you say\nI don't agree with this and you're living out your faith in your cake shop [noise]\nThat's true yeah this is October we turn down dozens of cakes to celebrate Halloween because of like Christian faith I don't believe that something you can do\nTo celebrate the same sex wedding ugly Bible teaches just to celebrate something other than that goes gets very core of faith and they said I'd be glad the\nCookies brownies anything else or make other customs kicks birthdays graduation so it's just a quick fix go against the teachings of like\nOkay so they want us to you they did to you and Matt Sharp what happens at that point [noise]\nWell unfortunately or as we might expect actually the civil rights commission and and all the way through the Colorado court system they ruled against jak\nOr they found that despite the fact that Jack serves everyone and and even this couple Harry gladly would have served him [noise] ah you know off the shelf items cookies cupcakes but\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and so we took it all the way the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we're glad to see in a a strong decision a seven to decision that the court said Colorado you are demonstrating hostility towards ... elite\nUm how you been forced is what you said about his believes all show that he wasn't getting a fair shake and and the state was targeting him because of his beliefs about marriage and that is in permissible under our constitution\nWell it's an amazing thing first of all I think it needs to be said again all Americans need to understand that we're living in crazy times I mean somebody might just say you know what Jack I got to be honest I totally disagree with you I think you're wrong\nIt's another thing to say you're illegal what you're doing is a crime in you're going to pay and we're going to sue you and you're going to pay and then to have the state agree and say yeah you have no right to have this point of view because I I just want to be perfectly clear\nPeople listening because ... you don't need to agree with me or with Jack you don't need to agree with us\nIt's one thing to say I disagree it's another thing to say I disagree so strongly I think you are doing something criminal\nAnd you need to pay through the nose you need to suffer for this this is not OK and the state says yeah we agree this is criminal\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just be honest not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views I mean look\nPeople like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of these a lot of people just didn't work crazy but you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their view is whether you think it's crazy or do you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up with its great lawyers and say we're going to have to go to court\nAnd this goes all the way to the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was our ... go ahead go ahead Jack [noise] you know you go ahead and nobody I Know in December the ... of December the fest okay it\nSince I was Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC so the court Ruth ginsburg Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts all of them\nAnd it was a failure to let's be clear with a seven to two decision seven to two\nOkay now there's a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak\nPhilips has a constitutional rights had been violated so this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wrong and you still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong it will be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp in\nLegal bills of alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved\nBecause you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and I'd say I'm best part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding Idaho person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousands that was that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand\nThat this most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff to shut you down because they think you're a bigot as I Want to say folks\nWe need you to help we have a matching goal if you go to my website ... attacks us talk dot

say that Lakewood, Colorado that's correct\nAll right and I'm also talking to a to match sharp as with the alliance defending freedom and so you guys are facing yet another battle that somebody has come to you and said okay you're not done we're gonna make you fight again we want you to make a transition cake which almost sounds like a joke like it sounds like is this real\nThe transition cake I when I heard that I thought\nThis is just um it's just extraordinary somebody's you know sort of playing head games it's like a ... let's see if we can get Jack Philips to make a transition cake [noise]\nUh and now you have to go back to court effectively don't you\nYesterday ... freedom right back again [laughter]\n... freedom right back to help us again a sharp news for the best lawyers I Know [laughter] so that juries are going to be working with is hopefully we'll get to straighten up this time [noise] for a\nWhile now ... where do you see this going I mean uh what is the next step who ... with the first battle\nYeah so it's kind of two two phases one we've got to that same civil rights commission that the Supreme Court ruled against it is\nDemanding a hearing on this um and so I think it's ... scheduled sometime in February but we're working with jak we are going on the fence on that since we've actually filed a lawsuit against the the civil rights commission and the state as essentially trying to put a stop to this that enough is enough\nJak has already been in the six years we've got a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThe state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of this is asking the federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is ...\nHow much begging you getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court and it's kind of not\nYeah not enough food to its stoking busy\nRight [noise] um my goodness I just ah [noise] it is that a cat\nThat's a torch I Do watch that or oh can you know on a true and I\nDo have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll night or everybody should read it gosh\nThat's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know um what it means to be an American and how precious it is and what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty the rarest thing\nA really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um thank you for I'm\nReferencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick this and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined\nA and we have to stand up and fight so now Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this\nUm so that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and ... which federal court is it can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and\nPotentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that uh we don't have to go that far that we can get a ... victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that\nRuling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court found to be problematic and so I think that's a strong precedent um that we're going to rely on and and hopefully the federal courts will look at that and say yeah\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them do

it\nCertainly is red eye radio and a smart guys for back with you again I was with you in September for weekend as a set of streets of effects on UPN I had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious demeanor kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the market's low show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next to be on October twenty ninth on another show but again check that out on my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight's I Want to keep my word\nFor someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now and the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first a segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story\nHuman might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and and another caller so that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo it's an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lacked the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right there would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but I just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nSo I'll give you some examples undocumented in this case over legal\nLivable wage and and minimum wage right we we live with yours for minimum wage here's a wage that the government by the way\nThe term that people should be paid which is ridiculous on his face in a free market economy and a capitalist economy out of the government know what the right wages for you and your business they're certainly not there when your business fails but they're going to tell you how much you have to pay your workers but of course people don't quite hear this argument and I could go on it's much more expensive than that\nHow about global warming or climate change right so they started if you're a member with global warming and then when it was really cold in certain places\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have a land at\nAt the land of freedom so let's build a wall and do everything to end dilute legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye

see what a friend in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well I'm a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and the liberals ... not a liberal that's called radical ...\nThey actually have taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they\nWhen they talk and American you know we think\nThat it's just sit here and there are thinking the whole this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to that sent me this is just normal stuff we're St grain wars when we say Americans and they they say American say brainwash us\nTo think that we're saying citizens and they and they they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have what it says US citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say are words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even want to air\nBecause of radicals or taking those words that choice\nThat's what I say\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to name I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them usurp that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for I'm not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAnd I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people get me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit now where Americans we pass for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're a national forecast for cobra electronics\nAn area of low pressure and we'll be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas\nWe're going to get about another inch of rain today and then a drying pattern begins with some spotty showers as we look at the week ahead for the region and we could pick up some moisture on Monday into the desert southwest for the four corners region southern states are predicted to have a wetter than average winter\nThere is a lecture national forecast from red eye radio a meteorologist John trout\nAnd I'm more ... and I want to know you're taking a legal immigration at eight six six Ninety [noise]\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us ... or send us the poor and is not our problem right now is your problem\nAnd then you can also add onto that will help them do we go we go to stop the stuff you know living\nAnd I know there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have for\nRight\nAnd you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this was terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe intro gangsters and we can make money some interest in you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou better than I Do oh [laughter] I don't think [laughter] that's a\nGreat call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what a ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were hitting someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there especially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want\nIt it's tough it's tough and a lot of your points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but do you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't want business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done not I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay into my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way Affleck Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why good people want to serve\nA pet especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you had to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things is limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what did he do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's\nReally bad so you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country except for all\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose\nBut even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it and then the Supreme Court could say you pass\nA law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most do you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six\nTalking about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven
