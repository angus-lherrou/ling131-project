Ciau Christie what is that exactly for folks who don't have a clue\nChristine means the reason of Christ at the center organization focused like a special ops ministry cameras apologetic to the angel is so we want to students and faculty with historical philosophical and scientific reasons for when Jesus\nWell that's pretty impressive I have to say university students really it's an interesting time in people's lives typically of course a university students are so open minded that they can often taken very very bad idea that may haunt them for the rest of their lives but at the same time because of the open mindedness\nUh there is an opportunity to reach them and obviously that is what you're trying to do how do you do this rescue Christie\nWhere we stand was clubs on campuses similar to campus ministries like camp aggregators sets us apart from\nThose ministries is that we can we own apologetic evangelists separates us from standard apologetic ministries is that we focus on the campus because we think that's the most influential institution western civilization right now\nWhile I'm ... I I Love it and ... and you grew up you did not grow up um a as a follower of Jesus where did you grow up\nMy ancestor was Joseph ... personal bodyguards and so I'm a sixth generation from Salt Lake City Utah and it's like coming out of Mormonism being shocked ...\nTruth claims well religions realities that made me pursue this is actually the truth and that's me into philosophy and comparative religions\nTriple a goal of truth and that brought me into philosophy in comparative religions where I'm at today happily as a Christian Randall is\nWill there about such an interesting thing because I Know so many truly truly wonderful people who describe themselves as Mormons they say that their followers of Jesus and I and I think many of them are\nBut we're talking about the doctrines of Mormonism what was it that made you see that there's something in the doctrines of Mormonism or that or not\nConsonant with what we would call historical worth the docks Christian faiths\nOriginally it wasn't the doctrines it was an existential encounter that I had with Christ I left Utah to go to attend a camping California only because I got to stay there for the whole summer with a friend that if I Would have tennis camp because dad made that the preconditions\nAnd I heard the gospel for the first time it really made a difference to me I never really understood my soon as I never really thought about hell\nI never really saw grace as being utterly gracious and it literally transformed gay and then I saw for the first time I'm Christ and people not religion and that's what made me a you know see that there was a fundamental difference\nIn the community that I had been raised in\nBut when I came back to Utah for my senior year of high school that's when I was challenged by my family members and friends and community that\nMay or may not carry very bad mistake as a sort of ... and\nI've got a Hitler and future ahead of me wanting the tours the Hitler perhaps if I knew the truth and I left it so I was challenged to read through the book of Mormon again this time for the sake of truth and not tradition and that's what I started seeing all the holes and it made me wonder okay on while I'm Glad I left Mormonism\nHow I Know this foundation of the Bible and Christianity is a true or trustworthy how do I know God he didn't exist and if so which God and that's what set me on this trajectory\nI I just find so parents anyhow gun ... everyone's so differently you are extremely rational and of course the organization is called ... Christi but it's interesting to me how you responded you know in other words you you have this experience with ... something happens\nAnd you're you're trying to figure it out and then you're challenged of course by by the Mormon community a ... ... ... and in some ways threatened and and so it forces you to think deeper another was he didn't just react emotionally ... let me go and see if I made a mistake and so\nYou you for the first time I guess looked more critically a at\nA Mormon doctrine and what was that experience like for you because so many people um you know they're part of something and they're not really thinking is this true or is this just how I was raised and what what was going through your mind how old were you at the time\nRight and that's that's part of a growing up in Utah culture and then the Mormon community it's more driven by sociology and psychology families Are Forever than it is by geology at a logic\nAnd so it wasn't until I had met existential encountering\nA that I began to ask deeper questions um but I had you know started to distance myself in my immediate community from the sociology Mormonism\nBecause of some of the hypocrisy that I see I didn't distance myself from the Mormon theology that's all I knew that's what I had that's what I believed\nThat only came a little bit later and that's what started the challenge me about Christian talk and others thinking and I never was a given to this kind of rational thinking I I had a zero point three eight GPA at one point\nBut it's why I came to know Jesus that knowledge became a huge factor in my life because after all that's why the goals in life is knowledge of God\nWell it's just an extraordinary thing and it's amazing how God has used you to challenge young people today to think more deeply you find on campuses\nThat uh that people are open to this kind of thing I mean what is it an open somebody at that age to ... to Jesus I'm just guessing it has to be got in that person's life but I I I'm just curious from your experience\nYes and I think you know being university is the first time many students are away from their homes if they're Christian students away from their youth ministry as their churches their families\nAnd now they're seeing all these other people from different parts not just a country but this is a different parts around the world\nAnd they're hearing messages from professors that are almost predominantly a non Christian secular ... times hostile biased Janet right\nWell yeah I and I and I think that that the um the forces of secularism\nHave in many ways overplay their hand in that there's so many people that we're such an arrogance about it that you kind of think well gosh what are they hiding or one of the soul motion all about um that that they're they seem not willing to even be\nI'm open minded about the possibility of Christian faith and of course Christian faith has affected so many people positively over millennia\nIt becomes ridiculous when you dismiss Christian faith and demonize it and I think you know most bright people see that they say wait a second I'm not sure that you can characterize something that way because much of the good that's been done in the world has been done\nIn the name of the Christian faith but you only seem to hear in the modern culture the negative things you know uh and\nAnd so it is a it's a strange time we're living in culturally speaking and I and I just think it's interesting that you go right to the university cause you do realize that that's a that's a place where you can catch people who were open to thinking\nYeah I I think people are more open to thinking a but it becomes highly problematic now with the secular rising of the universities more now than ever before\nA such that you know you've got your identity politics in I'm In the manatees what post modern relatives on it and then you have your scientific natural as in the natural sciences where\nA apologetic a evangelists\nAnd the left turns\nTrying to rewrite history and\nShame a Christian heritage and uh make a Christian thinking sound literally dumb yeah so that you know the average freshman comes away from his freshman year looking back cat uh you know his parents how they raised him or her maybe with a\nChristian background maybe they had a youth pastor but now they're seeing all these professors I'm which are singing almost harmony with a message that undermines the foundations for the Christian\nAnd I and I always talking about really factor

working on right now Corey you've got so much going on\n[noise] I'm working on a couple of ... and ... but we're really trying to do with our ministry and we're developing more and more ministry two professors\nWell that's interesting that that seems to me a\nA a tough job but an incredibly worthy job so many professors are afraid to dissent from the um ... from from the guys but I suppose from from the guys on universities which is practically Marxist or he\nIt really is dramatic ah how places at once embraced free thinking\nDramatic ah how places that one's embrace free thinking in the best sense have have been close to it over over a number of decades [noise]\nRight and I think one of the reasons why our industry is so important trying to equip students are in high school and college while they're at the university and just before they get there\nIs because of the rule the professors to professor really is the most influential post in the most influential institutional western civilization\nAnd right now I'm In the Washington Times said that the\nRatio of liberal and conservative professors twelve to one for those that are sixty five an older retiring but for those that are coming in younger scholars it's twenty three to one in some departments like religion it's Seventy two on\nAnd so I really think this is a field that most people are not reaching it in a sense it's like it's like an enraged people group it's the ten forty window of the western world world view it's one of the greatest donations of the great commission because if we can get a professor we can get their classroom to for Thirty years\nIsn't an amazing thing uh I I just have to take my hat off to you and and how do you go about this and how many campuses can you beyond and how many professors can you reach it seems like a a vast mission field\nRight I mean that's huge we at one point five million professors in the United states and collectively between the two other ministries that are doing after professors\nProbably only one hundred campuses out of three thousand five hundred campuses you've got a single staff person to minister to them [noise]\nSo we're trying to develop a movement of national professors online as well as on the ground to a chapter is a lot about a hundred and fifty campus is right now um where we can reach the digital population and how professors to reach other professors\nWell it's just an extraordinary thing I Know that there are a lot of a closeted Christians on campuses that they they just don't dare uh talk about it they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs and you think what an extraordinary place to come to a in the academy where people are afraid\nTo speak about what they think and what they believe simply because they could lose their jobs it's just extraordinary to me that were in that place I'm In a in the academy\n[laughter] I have firsthand experience with this Eric I think this is one reason I decided to\nKind of include profess to ministry and my overall I'm calling is because during my PHD program at Purdue last for his PHD in my face here because I was told that too much faith perspective so much for academic freedom\nAnd so I finished it in Aberdeen, Scotland\nAnd then when I was teaching at Indiana University one of the satellite campuses in Kokomo uh I teach and I I use standard textbooks most of them are atheist texts that I use\nA I was teaching ethics I had a former pastor a church gay and when I got to the\nPlace and human sexuality and attacks I get an alternate perspective on it from

alcohol\nThere's nobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that one I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser well the way you know I might as well [laughter] well ... is that going to happen in the five second I have on a bench Lee in the pot stores\n[noise] um [laughter]\n[noise] sorry man that's a ... everybody's vital nobody's buying pot anymore they're only by the lottery tickets which at that point I said well right now at this moment in time gambling seems to be a worst ice and drinking what was the only one by liquor it well\nThey said Seventy percent played in the eighties but I don't think our state had it in the eighties okay so I don't\nKnow about Seventy percent of those that have the lottery\nThat's not a cat I said it talking about the ... it's a panther fan [laughter] I'm pretty sure that when he was hanging out [laughter] yeah it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the\nMid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story\nOn the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says ... killing was premeditated and we'll talk about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of a ... yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to stay bus ride because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that when I were going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the care of and and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively\nAnd you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you\nThink about that if I'm going to put them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah and in the mid west\n... there are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yep uh businesses in that area that are supported by that\n... and that's a known quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with a formula as to who's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lot of time on and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats in what could hurt the Republicans because there are things out there that could hurt the Republicans in

everything that that uh has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that a whole okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles standing well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even\nClose over the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and severe weather in place for the region\nAnother whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas so a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and the below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nA surface slow moving through the great lakes region into New England\nWill bring snow showers for portions of northern Ohio\nUp in through upstate New York so along the lakes from Cleveland into buffalo I'm I'm Ninety look for some potential snow today more likely though as you get into northern New England\nWhere six to ten inches of snow is forecast for northern Maine a reminder winters on its way your national forecast drum red eye radio I'm meteorologist John\nTrout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nA aren't we're not talking the super rich were hot on about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse\nRight now they're still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman mhm\nAnd we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to then paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that made by perch that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nThem\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax cut and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt them we've also talked about the care of it\nRight and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears it along expected decline is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\n\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a worse it to the good caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us but the steel and and automobiles the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight\nIt's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's it unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost a binding automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about forward grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars mhm they\nBelieve the tariffs are going to the are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or\nOr a feeling it already and every dealership and it reveals that moment in the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased across from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price\nBecause of steel costs and now because of tariffs caused and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we had mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk or if you're talking about\nA manufacturing people would manufacturing jobs at a technical skills ton of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits but\nIt's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our ... and you said I Wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls were saying you are getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there was\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt and it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry are you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a chair of the that went into place or or any of that if they have to make arrangements a\nLot of time around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nIt's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're ... or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to\nWe were were ... or out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the coach wants it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do right uncertain that he has a\nKiller this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight and to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine\nThey there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well they've made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's\nLike blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the ... the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about\nWhere he is you know where he may be taking a you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I think a\nAnalysis of of the issues affecting this mid term ... eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nSix six months he\nWrote a ... if you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles been registered to join the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio and our sponsors deport your safety on the highway\nThere's not much pointed driving a fuel efficient truck if you have to give up everything that makes driving a truck great\nSo step up to the extreme efficiency of the western star fifty seven hundred ... and get your top back the fifty seven hundred X e combines western stars extreme heritage with dinosaurs advanced engineering to significantly improve the efficiency dependability in profitability", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "24"}
