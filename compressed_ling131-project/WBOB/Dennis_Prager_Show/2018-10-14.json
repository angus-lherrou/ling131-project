I always know\nWho is getting the award who's just bought bought some guy and when I heard your story I just flipped I said this is nuts and in part I think of the the best thing about you're getting that award is that\nIt made me realize who you are so I could have you on this program so that all of my listeners not just the people in that room at the costs are but could get to know you and the work\nThat you're doing a at the at the woods and center it it is Mitch magnificent to me now that night I'm part of what made it interesting if you had a number of these men\nWhose lives are you seeing transformed so to review for people who are just tuning into this program ... you're in the business of uh\nUh of retail uh you you you are working with people you've created the woods and center to to work with people that are struggling with drugs addictions are all kinds of stuff and you get them to turn their lives around and you have decades um ... in this in this world\nAnd as we talked I was saying that it must be discouraging because you're fighting an establishment that you have seen from over fifty years ago that that that the ... the civil rights\nMovement morphed into a kind of a grievance a thing it's just not something you saw from the beginning that it was not going to work and you dedicated your life to something else and I thought it must be so hard but you said it's because of these men that it puts a smile on your face that you keep going\nYes Mother Teresa or when she was walking Bombay but senator Packwood the time and he said to her Mother Teresa you must be frustrated that you are more successful after all you can only help three hundred people at your hospital and their three million who need help\nShe said God God does not require success of me just say for us\nIt's for him to determine when and if success is to occur and that and move for me to to just continue yeah and when I reached out to those young men and I saw how some of them I could ... when I first met them\nThey were just looking evil and I said to myself there's no way this guy's going to ever change what I'm saying to myself\nAnd then within two weeks I began to teach something awaken in him and then next thing you knew he took his same leadership for for evil to turn it into good\nAnd he became suddenly this Joseph this inspiring figure and that he went on to inspire others um and and so I I was just moved in and up and and so we look for in other words\nSome of the principles of the market economy applying the social economy in a market economy only three percent of the people are an entrepreneur but they generate Seventy percent of the jobs so when we're looking for ways of solving problems in the social economy\nMost of the innovation of curves among a very small number of people might but Derek Ross's than others but because of their witness and their influence lake and began to take a what they have done and influenced the majority of people\nThis is the is the trickle down theory and it works I mean it's it's really amazing to me because you have these leaders ah ... they have an outsized effect somehow that people look at them and it just has an amazing effect so it's like a trickle down of wealth but it's cultural well it\nReally does see and that and that violence reduction we we've we've we've refined those principles that we have an operating for Fifteen Years in Milwaukee school system I just got an invitation from the chief of police of the city and the head of city council\nIn Indianapolis, Indiana to bring our violence free zone program to one of the most dangerous if coats in that city we're going to be working through Pashtu Webster Emanuel missionary Baptist church\nPastor ... has a very unique ministry where he has had hundreds of men were they called a boot camp at his church\nThe hundred and fifty men most of them ex offenders come twenty straight days from five thirty in the morning to seven no breakfast so you have to be intentional about wanting to change but pastor works there has done a tremendous job of helping to transform and redeem people well we're going to take\nThis this ah um I took a gym daily there and he did a A N or for folks on the family is on the family so\nWe're going to this is a rich resource that exist within that community and I'm going to take our skill and talent and training\nAnd take that and apply it to that dangerous ZIP Code and so we're going to demonstrate that we can reduce violence and almost any community by twenty five percent in three months\nOK so obvious question Chicago or I mean are they not desperate enough to reach out to\n... I have made ... trips to Chicago talk through various groups offered to bring our approach there but there's the the the resistance to this is that people feel that they didn't invent it [noise]\nIt doesn't exist and if we have spent\nThree to four million dollars at the University of Chicago school of criminal justice and their interventions having worked if we put millions more and then how can you\nUh work so what we're fighting against is a tradition of failure that has become ingrained in institutions that resist anything new but fortunately we have some cities like Indianapolis and others and Eric I Hope to be able to demonstrate\nThe effectiveness of it in some place and we can get the kind of public attention to those successes cry and maybe we can change too\nWell I mean it it it's extraordinary you you know this is a situation in Chicago it seems beyond belief at this point and I guess\nIt seems beyond belief at this point and I guess I and you kind of wonder I Wish I could uh read the mind of the current mayor of Chicago to wonder what is he thinking what do we just he think you'd go does this just go away maybe just goes away\nA but it is so bad there and you're telling me\nThat you have the solution you've done this for decades this is not kind of like hey here's a crazy idea it it has worked over and over and you've seen it work over and over you can talk about it intelligently this is not just some crazy idea that happens to work you know why it works you can just cry when you do describe how and why it works\nUm do you depend I see that with the center dot org means that you're a non profit so yeah so you depend on donations yes contributions contributions ... I I really hope a father there's somebody listening right now\nThat understands that are you guys you're proven yet I mean when somebody ... you know you you you want to invest and stuff that you know a ... it's not a joke it's not a crazy idea it's working and this is something that's working it's very simple it's not very complicated right you know and it is working\nBut let me let me just walk us through how it works yeah um because we took those principles that transformed those young men and we'd be find it and to operating principles and others have you have a school like I started in Milwaukee Fifteen Years ago one school the Bradley Foundation gave us a grant\nTo go into one school if you have a group of uh let's say a thousand students they're controlled by ten\nPercent that ten percent ten percent\nSo if you so if you could use we put about eight to ... and young adults from the community many of them have dropped out of those same schools they have been transformed and they are Maro mentors and character coaches so they they spent two weeks to identify who would have shot call this the people\nWho is is this is really funny this is a movie by you understand somebody needs to make a movie about this because this is real\nAnd so what happens if you are done by that ten percent of the Cold War and then you reach out to them and and you give them a respectful way to be peaceful and uh and then they influence the other uh a Ninety percent and that's\nWhy we're able to go into a school most dangerous schools we only went into one and the principal said\nOh ah I'm not getting reports from teachers or something we what do we call it climate survey we as teachers just do you feel safer than the principal and the superintendent said hey the police are not getting calls to the school every so we did this one school\nThen we ... we went to a second we created the demand for it then the principal said and the superintendent can you do this to six schools so now we're going to Fifteen and\nIt's Fifteen Years now we have been but they always said he says Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nWith the dramatic this dramatic wonderful stuff I Want to keep talking to you and I will keep talking to you folks his ear my taxes you I'm Talking about what's in if you want to know more go towards in center dot org if you don't want to know more what's wrong with you senator dot org we'll be right back about what to [noise]\n\nOne nation and all of human history was built on that bedrock\nHours Republican of the people by the people and for the people\nSelf government requires freedom and\nJustice freedom requires an individual willingness to self governing\nFreedom is made America exceptional\nBut it can only last as long as you and I think as expressed by the laws of nature and nature's God\nCan only last year when I Choose to act as people's character\nForging character has been the pursuit of Hillsdale College to Eighteen forty four\nHillsdale College for just carrying an elevator civic discourse on campus and nationwide [noise] to find out how you can take their free online courses or receive a complementary subscription to climate a monthly speech digest this is Dale freedom\nDot com that Hillsdale freedom dot com and\nI'm so fearful I feel like my world is about to come crashing down around the ...

Seventy a thirty percent or not [laughter]\nThe question is what is happening among those who are raising children in poverty but not of poverty\nThey're raising children successful they are the real experts so I'd say two scholars I say the others go into a community not on the assumption that what you what you need to offer his charity but before you offered to do anything to find out who was already doing things\nThat has really brilliant I have to hand it to you because that's something that you seem to have a particular knack for seeing this kind of thing but that's it it strikes me as counterintuitive but then you say it and I think wow now may I mean anybody would say that makes perfect sense and so you you are but you have done that very thing\nYeah is that we call them that Woodson principles that took the staff called and the principal is is that to solve the problem of poverty that people shouldn't have to surrender the dignity to get help\nThat the foundation of any health relationship is ... pro quo I'd give something you and you get something to me\nAnd so we are to not do do food pantries and just hand things out to people\nWe must let them earned a matter of fact though you are a I talked about this that the acting Institute in a piece I did\nI for example uh they had a a a a woman's shelter abuse shelter where mom's food there and each year volunteers would collect toys and give them out to the kids everybody was happy but the moms\nWell executive director the second year allow the moms to burn toy vouchers by sewing bye baby sitting by performing certain chores that they would then or in a voucher and the toys that were collected workplace in a store\nSo the moms could shop for their own children are so this is the fundamental principle that we should follow when we're trying to help the poor\nAssume that they desire to they've got the ability to and the agency to help themselves that you should not to do more for people than they are willing to do for themselves\nWow that's I mean again that's perfect common sense but the concept of dignity\nBut it seems to have gone out of the culture it's not a part of the vocabulary of this culture dignity now I Know that when I think of civil rights heroes like Rosa Parks Dr King Jackie Robinson\nThere was tremendous dignity it seemed to be the main thing you notice with these people dignity that's just not a word that you hear [noise]\nNo but all of our grassroots leaders that what\nWhat what really has help restore them is they their embrace of the ... the fundamental virtues and principles about founders\nFelt self determination we look for agency we look for an opportunity to help\nAnd so we go in with the expectation that you have the answers to your own problems and therefore we will give you help we will give you access to money we will give you access to training\nBut the solutions have to come from you I'm not going to come and\nPaint your walls shoot pay your own ball [laughter]\nThat's the I mean it it it's wise is funny it's funny to me because it's so it's delightful to hear you say these things 'cause it's it's obviously true and anybody but a fool recognizes this I mean this is basic human stuff unless you really have a view of people that is deeply patronizing\nYou recognize that that people want dignity people want to be able to work people want to be able to earn something but it's as if it's not as if a ... ... people cultural or lead to have bought into these bad ideas are training\nOr people who are under privileged to think like victims and to say that dignity is a dirty word you don't need dignity you don't need pride you don't need it\nAnd and I say that dignity is a dirty word you don't need dignity you don't need pride you don't need to just take because it's yours you deserve it and I I think that we're training people somehow to think against themselves I\nPeople have needs but more important than that they need to be needed\nBut that was a big spiritual statement you know I mean I really used to\nBe needed but also a lot of well a lot of us suffer from intellectual Adidas that when we come to an educated low income people we always come is if we have something to offer you have nothing to receive\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them do you two six ...

is Aaron hardly and I'm Gary Mac them air you know one thing that the Trump said yesterday give ... noon as the medal of honor ...\nIt's just it's just I just I have to bring this up is this all related to because\nThe big because of the reaction\nOf the uh the the size of application and or the other memos that than the Trump Administration sent to the inspector general which she only reason that you would send something to the inspector general and not release it to the public is because\nYou wish the inspector general or without the interference of the media to do an investigation on corruption inside the department of justice based on the ... the application just throwing that out and\nYou know ... it's an interesting um\nIt's an interesting time because you I I went back and I saw a couple of things you mentioned about more mentioned about you know Russian pro ... over the last few days but they weren't the stories that we've been seeing\nYou know going back to the um it was the day of the Papadopoulos indictment\nAnd the New York times when the president tweeted no collusion and then the New York times wrote the story he was tweeting that as they were proving there was collusion with an indictment by the way proving\nAs they were proving there was collusion with an indictment by the way proving well the indictment had nothing to do with the collusion nothing and so that narrative became again they were writing it as if they were fact and I mean like a legal fact documented\nYou want legal facts go to Sarah a quarter dot com or go to you know uh when they were back or is there a quarter and and Solomon when they were back in ... news ah and they were releasing documents from the court those are legal facts\nBut lately the ... ... ... it's it's really the the chatter surrounding the whole Russian collusion thing has all but died\nAnd it's interesting there's nothing on it is handled yesterday and and the interesting thing is that seemed to happen about the same time at the White House sent all that information to the inspector general\nHas gone quiet as if it never existed because I ... I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G I wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but\nWell there were some direction there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to relieve some of our allies for were given to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics user forecast there's been a big\nDrop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year\nWe're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east we can describe the snow area as being between I Seventy to the north\nI forty to the south\nI thirty five to the east and a twenty five and the

the coast will be dry today the east coast high pressure sunshine into South Florida dolls quiet on the western front including the Pacific northwest\nYour national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nYou know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with but Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death of Kanye West because he smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion then Trump is exploiting the mental issues that Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the left no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the train I didn't write\nThat that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not\nSo much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment and\nIt was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane\n... if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't\nKnow what uh uh uh what what do you call it\nThe the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now I'm [laughter]\nI'm not I'm not sure what I mean [laughter]\nUh I I really don't know uh uh well I think\nYou can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks okay under than this one I don't understand the sense at All right uh when I Do I have no idea what this means yeah get\nBack kind of get back to you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nAnd all I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song tax man mhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes\nI mean that's accuracy is death I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me was that when they had the Ninety percent tax I was at nine for you and one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and\nI think in the ...\nI you know and I think the but\nIf you look at his demeanor the way ... is actually talk I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to them it's like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because he his demeanor was calm\nAnd straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\n\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell to go to the labeling in the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\nOr you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the insane comment but the same comment is well he's not capable he doesn't\nHave the facts wired to do that why is the mini ... why is anybody surprise\nThat\nA a black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall\nAnd remember you know you're a\nLot of rappers view themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening all if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite establishments\nThat is telling all blacks you must think a light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more\nMale rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous\nMhm as ... is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look and you say wait a minute the Democratic party has been manipulate look we get calls\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realized the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing mhm\nAnd obviously when that message is put out to any demographic that exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen\nAnd that's essentially the point that Congress made on chemical you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\n\nI mean imagine Trump had said that it would be done that not that\nAll blacks think alike but they should think alike politically huh it would be over\nCNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it and and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is ... you know it's the point ... who he's always been he's getting attention you know because that's what he likes\nBy the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioned a few uh you know running backs out there who I thought was great because wherever you leave out somebody's going to end the list was not included was not inclusive or would you leave at Walter Payton you know oh you know Eric Eric Dickerson people you know I'm going to bring a\nA you know a a that up and it's Smith\nYeah yeah yeah right yeah\nThurmond Thomas I have to bring that up because being a bills fan [laughter] I mean there's like so we're getting that we're not going to go to calls deciding who is the best running back of all time they'll list was not included for anybody else I Would have been the\nBest quarterback of all time if it weren't for Shawn Michaels [laughter]\n\nWith the grade school with a guy for about a year so you want to insult people start out and who who you believe the best running back as well [laughter]\nI I ... a ... if if if you want to see fat Shawn Michaels as a kid whoa [laughter] sure and you want to see fast he was fast and so I just ah why\n[laughter] talk\nTalk talk
