ship of fools brand new book ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America\nTo the brink of revolution heat is just out um I think people have been really hungry for a book from you we love the on TV but we'd like to read you as well so congratulations on the new book I Know it is just doing spectacularly well\n... thanks a million so tell us for people ...\nI mean you're talking and not I mean I write a script every night but I sitting down and was you know as an author I mean it just takes on the interrupted concentration looks right thanks very I so I'm not something I get very oh\nIt was a really interesting actually I I ...\nI can imagine so for people who aren't anything about it now you of course are uh I I assume most mountains knows who you are but you here's somebody that has been a conservative pundit and sinker for many many years on TV and various incarnations and now of course you're on Fox every night\nBut tell pope folks what this book is about and what made you want to write it\nIt's a really simple thesis um why did Trump get elected and I've been thinking about it because as you said I've been in Washington for thirty five years than it can serve it is\nPretty reliable Republican voter often against my will but you know no option so I've sort of watch and then the nonprofit conservative infrastructure Washington I've been involved in that sort of and speak and all of this and to watch from\nWhom I knew this 'cause I'm In the media come out of nowhere\nTo dominate the party it just raise the obvious question what is going on here right Republicans voting for this guy and how did he win\nAnd it couldn't be a simple question I mean I'm not a deep intellectual and the cable news so like I I address simple questions that'll get too deep in the matter is on my show and that seemed like the most obvious question of all and the and the answers\nThat you're hearing even now two years later our our ... stupid\nYou know why don't we Americans loved him because he's racist in their race\nHe's ... writer or it's of course\nThere are a lot of people who watch the Access Hollywood tape and decided you know by Leah manners speaks for me I mean it's so stupid right and the new Russia stuff whatever I mean you know what do we think of Russia and its place\nYou know when the geopolitical for him and it's it's it's not believable that fruit and Trump collectors didn't happen so why did he get elected and that's basically the thesis of the book it's not a book about Trump is probably the only book written in the past few years is not about Trump\nUm and and the answer is very simple that people in charge as a ...\nUm and and the answer is very simple that people in charge as of the first\nTuesday November two years ago didn't do a good job that people in both parties competing are Republicans he ran against the Republican establishment when of course he ran against Hillary Clinton all she represents and so basically\nIn a democracy you have to pay some attention to what voters want you know you don't have to do everything\nThey say I'm not I'm not a populist acts right right I'm by temperament and elitist\nOr used to wear bow tie I just think that if you're gonna have an all societies for her or hierarchical because people are also you're going to happen a week in every society the question is are they impressive or not in ours just isn't\nAnd that's the core problem the people making the decisions are dumb and unwise and selfish in short sighted and totally lacking self awareness and empathy that the actual problem and I'm pretty well situated to write that book since that's the group I you know I've lived among my whole life\nReally nicely I don't know a lot about going down into the pits of West Virginia I Know a lot about\nWhat it's like you know what it means to like spend time in Florida with private equity people because that's how I grew up right and I just know what I Know exactly what they're like and they're not impressive they shouldn't be in charge of the country to country and particularly not in my country so that's what that's the book but\nIt's it's funny it's funny to hear you you're talking I suspected that I I have a very very different book coming out next week called Donald drain the swamp it's a children's book but the thesis of it is effective\nRule really love that you didn't know that oh my gosh my publicist that really had it all in the downtown area on the\nJob is published by right wing chuckle Donald drain the swamp and Donald is a caveman right and uh he represents all of the cave people but the point is that the that the swamp is filled with these creatures you've just described it\nThat they they really are so out of touch with the people they're supposed to represent I mean if it's the thesis of of your book but I really do think that it has taken us a long time because Americans are patient generous gracious people and when you say in the title of your book\nA how selfish ruling class is bringing American to the brink of evolution revolution it took this long innocence before people could finally see my goodness these people are supposed to be representing us they are quite literally hired to represent us and our concerns\nAnd it takes it's taken several decades to finally realize\nYou know what they're not doing it's kind of like somebody who says I'm going to pay you back on a pay back on to pay back and at a certain point you realize\nOh I get it he's not going to pay me back\nOr that kind of what we have going on here is that the people on the cover of your book and by the way the illustrator Gary Locke is a genius I don't know ah where you found him but it's so it's such a beautiful cover\nBut the the ... these people are so out of touch\nThat they are whether they're simply nefarious and self centered or just incumbent and they don't seem to understand the most basic idea is that they're supposed to represent us that's the way the government is we the people\nAnd they're they're being out of touch has taken us to this point where a maniac caveman like Donald Trump he's the hero of the day because he actually subscribe to this insane idea that he's supposed to represent the people in middle America hits it's just it's almost funny that we have to write books about these things but it's just a\n... it's wonderful that you who come from the middle of the swamp although you're not a swamp creature you you really understand the Flora and fauna a of of inside the beltway world and it to me it's actually only in\nMy world I mean we're at the world you know that the world that produced me I've lived there and my ... and I don't ever want to pretend to be something I'm not I'm not a\nPopulist crusader again if you have a large populist movement in your country something is wrong happy countries don't have those yeah sweet ... you know Norway the same ... you know most famously happy countries in the world never populist movements\nThey do now right because their leaders made a series of really dumb and deeply unpopular decisions and wouldn't stop\nThat's that's what gets me look I made a ton of bad decisions I've supported a lot of things have turned out not to work\nYou know I'm a human being the question is do you make a mistake I mean I'm a Christian I Believe in forgiveness I mean that's part of the Christian story is ... I mean that is a Christian stories redemption so of course I Believe in that right the question is do you learn something from what you did argue\nAlive to like your own weaknesses in the states and the answer is absolutely not that's how you get populism not when you're a leader screw up that Russia when they refuse to acknowledge they did and then blame you for it so all of a sudden the middle class is shrinking it's now the minority of the country\nThere are huge segments of our population that are dying younger senior life expectancy ... corn those are the ... of the population or lead to attack it so it's like you\nKnow high school educated white men just has to pay this demographic they heroes perhaps exactly demographic with the highest suicide rate in the lowest like expect the declining life expectancy it's like when\nThey're the ones who are doing the worst under the system you're created and you're blaming them it's like it's a really recognizable\nPsychological syndrome you know it's called displays I mean ... like a lot of papers about\nTo see a trend that ... you're doing or projection factly yeah exactly\nYou I mean this is what people are white gets like alcoholics or the drunk guy yeah that's what it is\nOkay we're going to go to a break uh actually no I'm Sorry we're not not yet we'll talk let me just say that on the cover of the book the ... the reason one of the reasons I Love this book is that it's a bipartisan swamp\nYou have people from both sides of the aisle and people from no sides of the aisle uh on the cover because you recognize that the people on our side on our side very recently because of the cabinet debacle and some of them rose to the occasion\nBut prior to that they really had not been helping very much and I think that is why we have a populist movement now because the ... if they are also out of touch\nPeople they they have turned you know\nUh they're lonely eyes to Donald Trump it's an extraordinary irony in our history that this man from queens of who's been a developer who has no political experience has more political skill and more common sense ah\n... than any of these people were going to we are going to go to break forgive me when we come back talk some talking to Tucker Carlson the new book I'm sure you've already heard about it if you haven't gotten a copy get one it's called ship of fools stick around\nHe made the\n...

Ninety or red eye he is Aaron hunting I'm Gary ...\nYou know one thing that the Trump said yesterday give ... noon as the medal of honor ...\nIt's just it's just I just I have to bring this up is this all related to because\nThe ... because of the reduction\nOf the uh the size of application and the other memos that than the Trump Administration sent to the inspector general which she only reason that you would send something to the inspector general and not release it to the public is because\nYou wish the inspector general or without the interference of the media to do an investigation on corruption inside the department of justice based on the ... the application just throwing that out and\nYou know ... it's an interesting um\nIt's an interesting time because you I I went back and I saw a couple of things you mentioned about more mentioned about you know Russian pro ... over the last few days but they weren't the stories that we've been seeing\nYou know going back to the um it was the day of the Papadopoulos indictment\nAnd the New York times when the president tweeted no collusion\nAnd then the New York times wrote the story he was tweeting that as they were proving there was collusion with an indictment by the way proving what the indictment had nothing to do with the collusion nothing and\nSo that narrative became again they were writing it as if they were fact and I mean like a legal fact\nDocumented you want legal facts go to Sarah a quarter dot com or go to you know uh when they were back or so or a quarter and and Solomon when they were back at circuit news ah and they were releasing documents from the court\nThose are legal facts\nBut lately ... ... ... ... it's it's really the the chatter surrounding the whole Russian collusion thing has all but died\nAnd it's interesting there's nothing on it as hand but yesterday and and the interesting thing is that seemed to happen about the same time that the White House sent all that information\nTo the inspector general everything has gone quiet as if it never existed because I ... I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G\nI wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but\nWell there were some is direction there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to relieve some of our allies for were given to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics user forecast\nWe'll see that region

before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the leftist scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues the Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the left no no no uh nobody in the ... was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the country and I didn't\nWrite that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane\nIf you think about his demeanor because I don't\nKnow by the way I don't know what uh uh uh what what do you call it the the hero voyage or what whatever Trump is on right now\nI'm [laughter] I'm not I'm not sure what that means [laughter] ah I I really don't know uh uh well I\nThink you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're you're going to go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks okay under than this one I don't understand the sentence at all where I can I Do I have no idea what this means yeah get back\nTo kinda get back to you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nWell no I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song tax man\nMhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is death I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me was that when they had the Ninety percent tax was nine for you in one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and\nI think the but\nIf you look at his demeanor and the way Kanye is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to them as like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor was calm\nAnd straight to the point it wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment or after Katrina the George Bush comment wasn't that it was something that the content of the comment\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nWell they go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\n\nUh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the insane comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts wired to do that\nWhy is demanding Troy why as anybody surprise\nThat a\nA black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall and remember\nYou know you're a lot of rappers view themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening all if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite establishment\nThat is telling all blacks you must think light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more\nMale rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous\nMhm as Kenya is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look can you say wait a minute the Democrat Party has been manipulate look we get calls\n\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing ...\nAnd obviously when that message is put out to any demographic that exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it\nRight that is just naturally going to happen\nAnd that's essentially the point that Congress made on chemical you know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they got to be a part of groupthink\n\nI mean imagine Trump had said that\nIt would be done\nNot that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically huh it would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it\nAnd and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is ... you know it's the point ...\nThey and and for ... it is ... you know it's the point ... who he's always been he's getting attention you know because\nThat's what he likes by the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioning a few uh you know running backs author who I thought was great because wherever you leave out somebody's gonna and the list was not included was not inclusive\nOr would you leave at Walter Payton you know oh yeah Eric Eric Dickerson people you know are going to bring a\nA you know a a that up and it's myth\nYeah yeah yeah right\nThurman Thomas I have to bring that up because being a bills fan [laughter] I mean there's so we're getting that we're not going to go to calls deciding
