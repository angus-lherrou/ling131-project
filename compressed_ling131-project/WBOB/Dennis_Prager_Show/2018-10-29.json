a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they had their their spotlight division for many years and they did the basically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't known\nAnd then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else\nUm but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling you know it was it but they said in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie\nI'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I

fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country\nThe upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota most of Pennsylvania and New York in the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nAnd portions of central Iowa and we'll have some rain to contend with in the Midwest region I mentioned throughout the Indiana Ohio portions of the lower Tennessee Valley today we'll see showers move through moving off to the east will see those rains for the mid Atlantic\nAnd the New England states says we get into tomorrow the southern part of the nation will be dried today you won't need the windshield wipers on I tend from California all the way to Florida\nTexas gets another day to dry out there so look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John ... thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nHow do you change their heart\nAh then how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly well there are a number of last week it passed to keep because uh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it I mean how do you change your\nFreedom of speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you do\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason may be a I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this person's heart\nIs because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil and there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any\nMass killer in our history\nWell the list is very long\n[noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president Iraq Obama got his my witnessed or no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was just in Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news America actually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news seems pretty nice ... well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it it's something that you and I've talked about before where we've we've said\nAh for and and I mentioned for example everything went out on the news and you walk into the voting booth everybody greet you how you doing what's going on you know you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing thanks you take care oh have you don't have I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice but I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life right but that's actually the reality of a you know of of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talked about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is watch unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news is the unusual right that's why that's why murders\nAre news mhm because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time never encounter a a a murder right many some families do but\nThe majority of families in\nThis country do not when you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders are quite\nLow but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exist out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many uh documentaries every watched on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know ... going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not named going through that progression of her there's no it can't be and then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing shuts the\nDoor on the FBI and you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well\nOkay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no owners ... or ... or responsibility on the part of his\nBrother necessarily because it was as if you know he was learning it ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable that turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the synagogue\nYou know you think of that and I'm sure in in his mind these wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know\nClose or is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because\nIn our hearts there should\nBe one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil\nThe able to connect with in our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people and we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have debates and you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because when you put this all in perspective\nWe're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in we should be the case\nWhen you talk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or a debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these deranged mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nWe'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as a as it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd like to get in line soap an eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nDo for your goals the Sixers on radio [noise]\n\nBe
