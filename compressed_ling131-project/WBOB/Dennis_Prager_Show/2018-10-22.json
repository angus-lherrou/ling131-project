S P e W slime art was [noise]\nThe um uh what was it going to tell you oh the reason the Kmart and Sears and Macy's and all these stores are are in trouble is not because of Amazon Mr ... the reason they're in trouble is because of the apple store\nWhat did the apple store do it showed us how it could be done the apple store revealed to us how it should be you and I go into an apple store what happens ten people surround us and say how can we help you\nAnd then we moved ten feet in another ten people go how can we help you and then when we want to buy they do not give us the opportunity for buyer's remorse they take a a black device off of their belt\nAnd they say credit card cash how do you want to pay for this do you want the receipt emailed to your printed out now whoa\nAnd then the minute we say okay I'm going to buy this they sell it that second because every single person who works at the apple store can closes sale\nWhat happens when you and I go to K.

all\nSense of space and time\nThis goes on for ... doctor who you know ... all sense of space and time disappears when you enter Macy's or deal alerts or um\nOr any major department store but fears is worse than it's been worst for years what happens when you go into Sears nothing\nYou walk into is this the main entrance it's never clear in his ears or Kmart is this the main entrance it doesn't look welcoming instead there's random equipment of random furniture in science to the point to nothing\nIt's a horrible not welcoming experience that is why they're in trouble it's not because of Amazon\nIt's because they lost their way they forgot how to merchandise how to please now what happens when you go to Costco when you go to Costco\nAnd you're in line and you realize after you filled up your heart and you're about to buy things that you forgot to milk\nAnd the thought of having to go back to Costco is overwhelming just to get the milk\nThere's a person standing at each cash

I never picked up a golf club once my good me now is not one oh my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got to make that argument coming up yeah the independent Bob got all by the way I was sort of an independent Bob just\nCalled me a few times just ranting I think he knew it was um vacation he just ranting and raving Elizabeth Warren thing just sending them into outer space yeah he's just like this is just\nWell on the they they believe that's a good thing to do\nBut they believe that this is a good tactic would you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the left as using\nI mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file of the protesters talking about the people holding off it yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe\nStuff like this is going to work and and that and you and I made sure that before he went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet not understand this is the mainstream now yeah ours is the\nDemocrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this is the average Democrat it's the average Democrat now representing you sure in Congress and in the Senate right\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the ... big problems that she by the way they want to narrow it down just to three well one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yeah she's Native American you all white privilege that's white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right I and and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that the polls everything else you've got a great show up for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the\nSouthern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued a couple of regional highlights it will be warmer in the west know changing the chances for snow in the Northern Rockies it'll be drier and warmer\nThe great lake region is expected to be drier\nKnow parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter but as a Seventy five percent chance of an El Nino developing which means wetter conditions are possible across the country for winter bears or look at your national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John throughout\nThank you John eight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join his success [noise] Ninety run I sorry I was busy at the same way I Would be from family yeah [noise]\nAnd we talked about how the protesters lead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy and then\nThen I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\nQuite right does it does is destroying transgender as if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing the ... just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter]\nBefore this one of the leading liberal icons\nSocialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice ... and regulations number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the is that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter]\n[laughter] where does the decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop well and if\nI were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people forget about that because again what you know it that when a President Obama\n... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the the Atlanta for a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was the Atlantic ... he did a a an interview with\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your ... mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... so is that it it now is that done now\nHas the left moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules\nOf the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ...\nEverything from cultural appropriation to the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science Warren [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the row\nHere's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority what Trump says that they criticize in fact check is off the cuff Mm right\nIt's it's an opinion or just a thought that he just boom records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on cars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I [laughter] you think that I won't watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated and thought out yes no planet today\nThey were trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty force of a second [laughter] my my favorite was the\n[laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fourth yeah maybe seal and it was a huge I with a gun [laughter] we're in a swimming pool it's you know that that's it it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win\nFor them look in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty safe like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well by the way not present the White House I mean yeah but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both\nUm [laughter] we ... do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again you know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do to protest or type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this\nWas a few months ago when we were talking about\nWhat the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because\nNo longer can you have\nA debate\nNo longer can you have a real discussion ... what are they going to say well the economy is suffering Mm as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nA jobs we need more jobs Mm we haven't ... finding enough people right now I'm so the what are you going to do well do you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display you know the one who hates them most is gonna win ...\nWhere it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free yeah yeah and I mean the ... and that we are the other day we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset\nI mean ... ... and that we are the other day we we're we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do we used to control\nA lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation\nUh uh uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states right by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response that we got from Democrats on this ... where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we now know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate\nThey don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground over their vacation and you know the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to the Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college at you know it exists because we're not in direct democracy were republic\nWhere constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that the Democrats and the ACLU use to care about right but now as we know they don't write and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round\nI you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from oh Casio Cortez and Gillum separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media ask ... wasn't so tough but they did ask the question\nIf you're Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff you've got to go for one because you have Gillum and Florida promising to world Casio Cortez promising the world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay let's give everybody right oh let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just get cash to people right and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college and\nYeah and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of\nA little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of them did\nSomebody will get to the point where we talked about before the twenty sixteen election just offer every American a hundred dollars that exactly or one ticket to the mega millions later this week yet [laughter] eight six six Ninety right I\n[noise] books with literally radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel tell a hotline at eight
