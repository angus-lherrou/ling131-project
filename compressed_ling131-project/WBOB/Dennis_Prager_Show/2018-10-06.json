F. I. L. uh five sixty am in Philly\nListen to oh boy well listen yeah we've got a lot to share here we've got Governor Huckabee coming on to the program for any second a lot of people who listen to this

little bit he's the real deal he's coming on this program\nA in a couple of minutes but before we go to before we throw\nThat is what we say their media ... before we throw to the governor\nWe we need to share some stuff first of all album yeah this this just came up with everything you wanted to share this\nCame over the taxes taught talk dot com wire yay yay you know the FBI F investigation just wrapped up you know a couple of days ago about the ref\nBrett Kavanaugh well the FBI this is this actually happened the FBI found a picture the cabinet drew in kindergarten all ... yeah it's a picture of a man with a very large head yeah and a grotesque U shaped smile and and then his limbs were all out of proportion right so now the eggs and stuff yeah yeah like that\nAnd so now the Democrats are asking a very not and this is a very good question how can you point Kavanaugh to see it as a judge on the highest court in the land when at the age of five he was clearly clearly making fun of oddly shaped people\nYou know something that is not appropriate at any age you know and I stand against that no you know I I I honestly they're oddly shaped people all over the world and people in America of all places to have\nA Supreme Court justice mocking you yes in kindergarten in a public way so call your senator and say huh\nThat's incredible I mean the idea that that he would draw somebody with a big head like that I don't know if he's making some commentary some political commentary but that money to Shane versus said that it's inappropriate and when you elevate somebody to the one of the highest levels in the land who has been on the record\n... drawing stuff like that in kindergarten somebody needs to speak up and I'm an I'm at the the the the the head of the class here I got to do it I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to speak up I don't care I'm working with local party you're in ... will not stand up\nAnd I can't believe you would make light of a thing like this help and I can't believe it was the metallic talked about Tom why are\nAll right I'm like I like to shift the conversation now things are do you know it's usually we have a listener mail comes and okay somebody wrote in Susan Robinson wrote from Colorado [noise]\nUh she says a a good morning I've not been able to listen for a few days you ... are ... may already be doing this but please encourage your listeners to

D.C here's the phone\nPhone number here ready and this is this is the phone number in D.C here's the phone number of folks if you want to call you can call this number and ask for the office of any senator or right now you got to do this responsibly this is not a joke\nUm you go to to oh to call to oh two two to four three one two one that's too old to\nTwo to four three one\nTwo one are you scrambling for pencil let me say it again too old to two to four three one two one\nOr you can call any senator or you can just type in contact and the name of the senator and Google and we'll come

another one here let me see [noise] man it just means so much to me that that people um [noise] would write a to us let me see if ah if I can read this one here um [noise]\nYeah this one's a tough one this one's a tough one door the Steven ten is writing from California [noise]\nAh she writes the left is not only rebelling against the president in the United states they're rebelling against God now what she says she's quoting scripture let every person being objection to the governing authorities for there's no authority now you can interpreted interpreted different ways people have a right to dissent but I Do detect\nIn what is happening right now [noise]\nA a clear\nHow do I put this as the stepping over the line that\nPreviously we we we hadn't been willing to step over and that has to go to descend to a level\nOf such naked politicking that you don't really care about the other guy right and we're supposed to love our enemies which which means that you you can still fight someone but you fight them the way you want someone to fight you fairly by the rules using the facts or whatever\nAnd so I guess for me what I say there's two things you can do you can pray and by the way folks if you're any kind of a Christian or person of faith\nYou you're obligated to pray for your country is just not like extra credit it please folks pray\nFor this country because this country has meant so much to many people around the world including my parents who came to this country has very young people they didn't know the language they didn't have a dime they came here because they were hoping opportunity and they thought maybe some day\nUh they get a family here and they could have opportunities that they could never have where they came from and\nUh I'm proof of that my brother and I\nAre are proof of that and it means so much to me that this country has offered that to people around the world and continues to do that so\nI'm pleased pray for the country but also I Want to say to vote and I want to say the pastor's out there you need to encourage your congregation to vote why do I say that\nUm because in this country many people are in the past ... many people in churches have gotten this false idea\nThat we are not to be vocal about anything having to do with politics that his rank nonsense it is absolute nonsense now people say well I don't want to lose my five oh one C. three status or whatever I got to tell you something folks first of all you're not going to lose your five one suggests that that's\nThat's a ... word that has been circulated to shut you up\nYou have every right to speak about the unborn about biblical view of sexuality and you have every right and indeed I Would say not ... to tell your congregation that in every election in in this one particularly in these midterms they must vote please tell your congregations\nTell ah the people around you and your community they must vote there is so much at stake here that you have an obligation to vote\nAre so many people wish they could vote they can't vote pleads folks please I'm just asking you if you care about biblical values if you care about sexuality in America\nWe're we're losing our religious liberty so that you can't even say what you feel is a biblical view of sexuality I mean uh we we had on the program the fire chief who lost his job as a result of\nOf saying what he thought was a biblical view of sexuality is one of the kindest individuals I've ever had on this program is wonderful we had him right here in Studio ... by the way let me say this ah speaking

seem\nAs though anything they can do to attack this president or or take down his his nominees hits a scorched earth policy where do you see us going from here\n[noise] so if we don't bring some sanity back to the system um I'm not sure that our grave Republicans survive long term and and for me Eric I Believe that what this comes down to is whether or not people who lose an election will accept the results\nWhat we're seeing is the outgrowth of people who never accepted the results of the twenty sixteen presidential election and they have spent the last almost two years trying to date legitimize the election\nAnd the person who won and every decision mix whether it was a decision involving protecting our borders where there was a decision and bombing or the negotiations with North Korea getting out of the deal of Iran every single thing this president does\nIt's a tax whether legally or politically by those who were fused to accept that he is the president of the United states and as a dangerous thing I didn't like it when President Obama was elected didn't vote for him either time um but I never ever\nThought that the way to deal with his presidency was to try to pretend that he didn't win the election and to quote him he said elections have consequences while it appears that to uh to people on the left the consequences of some of the election they don't like\nIs to throw a tantrum act Petra slowly like a five year old a hold your breath to your face turns blue and scream and throw things across the room and break every window in the house\nIsn't that isn't that what George Washington did\nA it really is kind of funny actually because when you say that it it it makes a I I think most people realize that\nSomething has happened in the country it's it's funny because I remember even the election of two thousand and we have the hanging chads and that bizarre period no one had ever lived through anything like it where where\nYou know the day after election you don't know who won in the week after you don't know who won and I remember at the time thinking this is undermining our institutions because what it does is it it reads a kind of cynicism and

past history the Republicans should lose\nA house members mhm that's\nWhat happens I mean it's almost a a a a a a guaranteed right just like when somebody asked us back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's going to win I said well actually we won't be because\nA history shows us that when you had this long of a down economy the opposition party usually wins and that that's

people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together or not McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill ... that was a that was a that is when they blew the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that one I read that was on a specific topic yeah I ... the\nSame thing ... bright that's powered are short lived yeah sure I surely this this is different because\nIt is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump and reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal\nOr interesting that they write this the same day that you know the ... the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while because the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he's separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nIn in supportive of up cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're\nFighting with each other because when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] the one the one old out except for except for Bill Christ and I haven't seen anything from George and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know ... not part of the ... he he's not some and they ride and he's got some Steve Bannon insurgent\nAnd the judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization\nFrom\n... from ... I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case here Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life this goes beyond a political issue it goes to what\nOne Trump the election\nIt is\nThe it is the culture war but it's also ... and and I say a culture war because it's a war on it it's it's it's about it's\nAbout fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe we were never Trump ... we've criticized Trump but we were you know we were never on that never I never got about ... ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see a ... rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that with a man he\nGoes outside I I think I Would only vote for as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election and twenty six being you know well ah you know I guess she wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me [laughter]\nAnd and so I I think when when you see that\nThat ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are number Trump hers that all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there are actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but but the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump ... looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh it was it a try to think of the the the person oh yeah yeah it was a member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump they'd rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nAh I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that I saw it on social media and a lot of people furious ... excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and those that are Jonathan is it ... they're at a use it on Fox News on the\nOn the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when it came out with\nWell he was one of those\nOtherwise conservatives that what came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report on bin ...\nYes so I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow liberal except for the Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner\nOr which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending to nominate\nFive weeks before the critical mid term elections House Republicans are outgunned and out man as a constellation of well sourced democratic groups dedicated to winning the majority overwhelmed GOP defenses\nFrom financially flush superPACs flooding the zone with advertising the grassroots organizations directing money and volunteers to targeted areas around a dozen political groups\nAre feeling the Democratic party to flip twenty three seats and capture the house on November sex in a toxic environment driven by discontent with President Donald Trump\nThe barrage has become too much to handle for the two groups manning the barricades for House Republicans the national Republican congressional committee their official campaign arm in congressional leadership fund they're designating super PACs are guys are taking a beating said robbed Sims a Republican consultant\nAnd former and are cc executive director said Tuesday in an interview with the Washington or an egg examiner\nOr and so I mean just your your go through this whole article ... they they go through it specifically you know the money that's being spent by the Democrats and the vulnerabilities we're there to the point and these are the people the money people behind it saying\nWe're going to be swept by the Democrats are\nSo which one is true\nWell ... and and there's what yeah that's why you have the election right exact election and\nAnd remember I'm a Casio Cortez her opponent spent a think it was somewhere around three million and she spent\nRight monetarily yeah money doesn't always win you know it it is the message is also the motivating factors that we talked about and clearly Kavanaugh one way or the other I mean it and and I\nI Would agree with the peace to a certain extent a written and and uh at at our CPA and I'll get the author here in an intimate or they deserve the credit but the idea that you know it's theoretically it could benefit either side\nYou know to a certain extent again but typically what do you see historically\nA there's been a a younger demos\nTurned out for the primaries this year they don't always turn out\nNecessarily in November for a for a mid term so we'll see if that actually changes this year because again what could motivate them and and the number of things could happen\nBetween let's just say I haven't I was ... confirmed on a Saturday or Sunday and he's on the bench on Monday everything's going to change and there will be something else for people to talk about that\nTrump about or whatever it is and that's the difference so we'll see what happens\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas really muscular and Carly radio [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "06"}
