about the book and I love those guys are excited book it must be a great book so I'm going to get copies and um yeah you should read it but but actually what really makes me happy\nIs that I went and the only way you can see how a book is doing realistically\nLike moment to moment is to check on Amazon there's a rank and to get on a product descriptions it says it gives you the book rank them and uh obviously you want to get the number one the number one bestseller in all of the universe\nIs now here's here's the thing right now what the number one book my book\nWas oh I don't know a thousand or something like that and then as I got on the Hugh Hewitt and whatever to it it went to like three hundred something which is decent right but it's still not in the top one hundred\nWell this morning are just now it jumped to one Seventy so we're we're going down the neck of the top one hundred right what's the number one book in the country Stephen Colbert\nOne hundred right what's the number one book in the country Steven cold there has written a bitter anti Trump\nFake children's book now it's a real big children's book in the sense that you would never give it to a kid that looks like a kids' book but it's not appropriate for children because it's just kind of mean and weird\nBut my book of course is uh even though the human book for adults like coal bears book it's really also children's book genuinely you can give it a kitten and people are giving his kids and kids like it\nAnd they specially liked to say George Soros but what drives me crazy is that called Barry is on every night right being mean it's one thing not to like the president but he's pretty vicious if I had a TV show like his\nI Would never be that vicious about Hillary or Obama or whatever it's one thing to correct jokes I mean Johnny Carson always cracked jokes about the president but there's a meanness to it that bothers me and so of course now he's ... he and his writers and put out this book and it's literally number one\nIn the country and so\nI kind of like to send a message or\nTo the to the country and this and to Mr cold there are by having my book uh at some point overtake his book yes so that means his but I'll have to drop from number one\nAnd a or my book could just go to number one but you know there's so many people in this country who don't hate the president and I kind of think like hey\nI'm if you donate the president or maybe this book is for you and I actually think that this is a good book to give to people who don't like the president because it's it's warm hearted it's not I mean it's not like ha ha but whenever I just just had to say that I was so glad that she would love to the dentist Prager loved it\nI was supposed to be a machine and Bream last

tell their leaders what to do in the leaders have to do and they say you mean the president goes yeah and it goes up that's what you're looking for um your caveman so we had these buttons printed up to say he's my caveman\nTo give ... fresh and wonderful and I'm happy to report that on the line with me is our friend Sebastian Gorka Sebastian welcome to the program\n... have you back Eric\n... oh I Love talking to you about anything any time but you've got a new book out of course I've got a new book out but enough about me what do you think about my new book just getting a year a new book in which I I Wish\nI Wish I'd thought about it but\nAs long as somebody thought of it you know you you um you have a new book out called why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies the title of your book\nObviously makes most of us think of this president there's something about this president there that he's a fighter and sometimes I think people even people like me bristle a little bit we you know because we think sometimes there is a time to apologize and so and so forth but he seems to have this site or spirit in him that's unlike anything\nWe've really seen in modern times I Can't think of any president even approaches and even my favorite president Ronald Reagan he didn't have this kind of a ... side Trump has that you have that in the book title why we fight defeating America's enemies\nWith no apologies obviously you capture that what is it about this time that made you write a book with this title with this theme and what makes this president I\nHave this attitude why do you think we need this right now Sebastian\nThink it's very simple I think the reason that most American elected in ... president it's because all of the book on on the left and the right\nBusiness as usual politics do does represent the will of the people and doesn't fix the problems that have been festering ... exactly the same thing happened with a British cousins were Brexit\nThey sold the European Union fundamentally representing the interests of the British people are offended enough is enough ...\nI I think the fact that I traveled with the president's Youngstown, Ohio that's the whole valley called democratic area and we went for a rally stadium was packed I met with hundreds of people before the president later speech\nAnd it was electric because there is a manual labor's steel valley right salt of the working class Americans you know what the weather if the Democrats the parents their grandparents and ordered billionaire from Manhattan came on stage with his beautiful why what happened\nThe whole building resonate for ... minutes with Charles to USA USA\nGrain of salt because they're the Texas\nThis is Youngstown, Ohio and I think I think that tells you everything you know people want to have things fixed\nThey look at the blow in Washington they look at ... cents\nThey look at the blow in Washington they look ... senators and congressmen who built Capitol Hill for three or four years yup which would horrify founding fathers other that we need a change we need this kind of pauses to disrupt the crew Donald Trump or\nWell you're very right it's funny when you when you see him appear that way and you have all these working class people clamoring uh to see him to cheer for him it reminds me of Churchill in World War two and I think that we're kind of in a battle even though some people are not willing to acknowledge it\nWith forces that in their own way or as pernicious\nPernicious as the forces of fascism in Europe they they threatened\nTo destroy everything we hold dear these are existential threats to self government to liberty to all of the things that we have built over centuries in the west and I think that\nYou know the common man in America gets it he sees it in in all kinds of ways and so that people have in fact been looking\nFor a hero heroes are never perfect they have feat of clay but they have inability to rally people when you think of Churchill trickle was far from the common man as anybody I mean he grew up in blend them\nPalace for goodness sake and yet\nSomehow with an American mother with an American uh yeah well there you go that gets them out of it well so but it is so fascinating because when you mentioned this billionaire showing up with his beautiful wife what is it that resonates and it's I think the idea\nThat people say look he's fighting for me somehow I Know he's fighting for me that's a big deal in this day and age when you have people like you know nobody really believed\nThat that Mitt Romney are Jeb Bush had anything approaching that and and God Forbid a ambassador Huntsman and these are not the kind of people who are going to resonate with rust belt\nOr work or is it so it is it's it's a fascinating phenomenon you're quite right\nOr an editor all the justice and see that in many cases it is for a lot of the popsicle through the ... the assault to grill Americans\nWere people that are not because they actually do this isn't just rhetoric without a politician promise never produce the president says I Want to cross arts at school or do you come across and by the economy stinks everybody's you know like like a gala tied down by the litter fusion regular Joe\nCompletely changed then what happens to the American economy and the most important role when it comes to a\nMoral fiber you look at what he did for junk this capital in the White House where he drew said stood up to the whole world and said mom have being wrong and he is innocent so it's\nIt's not just the impression of fire I think it's actually ... as you kind of fake that\nIt it it is funny because I I think again that we need that more than ever there's there's just no question I think that he had run for president in Nineteen eighty it wouldn't have worked but the fact of the matter is today we are in such bad straits I mean it's an amazing thing to think that\nGreat Britain voted they voted to leave the European Union thank the lord and you have so many other\nFolks in Europe who are seeing the same things there are magnified that we're seeing here and they're finally we're building something has finally happened where the common man and woman\nAre they really are understanding it is not everything they told us we've given at forty years it hasn't worked we've got to take action it's an it's an amazing moment in history\nIs um I I think that changes in American politics forever but I don't think there's an off the eight years of Donald Trump there's no going back to business as usual I think it's either is\nWhere the Democrats and their so called from the ... when the ... the latest poll by the show by the end of the top of the list that ... the president's opposition ... up ... nothing you know in the last two years\nWell it's I mean obviously we must first ah when the mid term than I Am concerned because I Do think that\nIf we get a even slightly apathetic I mean when we talk about a fight this is a fight and again you don't have to agree with everything about Donald Trump but you've got to understand that if you do not\nVote for him and for his candidates and if we do not hold Congress we're going to have horrific Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer chaos\nIn the nation's capital for two years it's going to be very unpleasant a and I'm I'm concerned for the country so people really need to vote I mean wherever you are folks please uh it's it's it's just something that I I think it's never been as important you know I've discussed this previously\nEverything that we've achieved from the Supreme Court and national skip the colony is on the ballot in less than three weeks by\n... in the mid to listen to the left has said we we have the the leaders of the Democrats the house and Senate thing we intend to sabotage the president and see if we take the house it will be\nA subpoena or off the Supreme investigation author shouldn't full too often look for any and it's good for Americans but just because they do Trump ... the question on the ballot will be a you're giving in to ... do you love this country it's really about the more complicated than that\nWell the irony of course that the that the other side keeps talking about hate down with hate I've never seen so much hate in my life it really is dismaying it's genuinely dismaying that people\nAre who they have all kinds of issues with this president ... good for you if you do let's have the debate\nBut to effectively a say we don't we're not interested in having a debate we're interested in shutting you down with every kind of\nEpithet it's it's a little mental place for us to be in the United states of America it's it they run out of arguments Sebastian and I don't know if we do when the ... midterms which by God's Grace I Hope we do\nYou kind of wonder what happens to the bitter left at that point\nYeah I mean this is one of the reasons I wrote why we fight did it for the shop and the understanding\nAnd and the political environment today want to find fuel is literally hatred or you look at a treat for you look at Maxine Waters you look at all these other people made that road are travelling\nOr American meant to shut off Maxine Waters traveling of Democrats to harass female cabinet members went up pumping
