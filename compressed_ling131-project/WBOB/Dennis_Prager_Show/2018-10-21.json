comedy short Margaret least comedy castle more car was packed full of all of my items and I drove off to New York city and and why did you do that because I was doing comedy and\nAnd we drove off to New York city and and why did you do that because I was doing comedy in in Michigan and\nI Want to let a lot of parking tickets and you wanted to get out of area that's part of the store okay so you said I'm going to New York to do my comedy\nWell in New York I was doing ... already but in New York if you're not bunny their way to let you know they'll say something like a pony uh-huh\nSo I wanted to come in and out now like in Michigan where people are sort of polite Dutch people in Michigan view and they're all phony sometimes yeah I'm just telling you straight up right now they're all ... all those Dutch Michigan people and they will not tell you the truth and say for example hey that's not funny but you had to come to New York for that I used to play double Dutch too so ahah\nSort of to hurt me twice as much when you said yeah exactly on the double Dutch bus so we can we can sing that later but let me ask you when you came to New York when did you have a plan or you just going to come here and\nYou know I had NO PLAN I actually didn't have it I Would I was just like I'm gonna do whatever it takes to try to get into at least break into somebody's comedy clubs sort of comic strip law which I think is still around ... are you there for some with diverse club I was able to finally break into it was so hard to get into this club they used to have an open Mike on Tuesday nights\nAnd broke and did you have accomplices or you just did that on your own oh cool I'm about I was going to the jokes are just\nToo and I tell you something let me tell you something pal in opening ongoing throughout the that are actually I'm a little ... anyway these lower and when you broke into the club you what happened tell us the story\nSort of where to get into this clubs on Tuesday nights they have a ... an open Mike by seven PM comedians who are new in town start lining up at like six o'clock in the morning wait a minute really know for\nLike ... they have this whole honor system where you got Fifteen minutes to go to Russia or only afterward like you would really hard to find them I turned to perform and is in in this community named George Wallace walks here who you probably know I Know George Wallace awesome to George Wallace water legend a life ...\nWhy why do they have like a legend they're when they're supposed to be tryouts for young comedians\nWill it's open Mike night in any legend like dirt roads whoever can show up whenever they want to kick you to the curb exactly and I'm next and he walks in\nAnd I know I'm about to get bumped into managers already walking over to me but this is actually where a guy shows up for the first time in my life\nWell this is where I noticed yeah sort of manager said to me hey uh George laws here do you want to go and before him or [noise] I think you want to go home before he just asked St Louis we want to go on a journey to crush it and then you've got to go next to act the way\nSo you're going to tell us why the film is called more than funny are Hoeber Eighteenth wiser call more than funny yeah one night only people so if you're going to Nineteen to going to be watching ... so you want you know and you don't want to do that you you don't want yeah\nSo about nine years ago and doing the show and the Los Angeles comedy club the rubber front on a stage I had a change in mindset about comedy [noise]\nNormally when a comedian gets on stage I'm all about getting laughs and people write without a ship take place where I felt like instead of trying to get laughs when people I should give them an opportunity to a\n... year changed everything wait a minute yeah that that sounds like a head game what you just did write so instead of trying to get laughs from the people you're talking about giving them an opportunity to laugh exactly again here's my question\nWhat was it me\n[laughter] it means means intuitively as a comedian ha ha you get on stage to receive yes but my whole everything shifted to I'm getting on stage to give\nAnd I can't tell you how it has changed everything so that same night so you so this is not just so you mean as seriously that that you before you went on you had this thought ended it affected how you perform that night absolutely absolute because here's the thing if you have a gift for someone\nYour job is really just to present the gift it doesn't even matter how to respond to the gift\nYour job is to present the gifts to appear like it if they don't like it doesn't matter in fact what I've learned is it actually takes to control out of the audience his hand\nSo I Do the show tonight and I leave the club and across the street among ... people are taking pictures autographs ... every time I leave this club don't you hate that when they get away from me man backup give me my privacy backup lady it was just one time I fall I'm famous and attractive to mine get away there's just one brain yeah yeah so\nI look across the street a says her most of each other if you've been there before it was a really nice area\nAnd a a lacrosse arena saw homeless guy\nNo I've never seen a homeless guy outside of Columbus for ever and I've been there many times but that doesn't mean he wasn't there before but it just means before my mindset was to get last for people to why wouldn't even notice homes do so I noticed when I was like what about him how can I give him an opportunity lab\nFor real four days later this lady was an autograph line she says to me hey\nWould you consider coming to the homeless shelter where a volunteer and do a comedy and I was like a no it's just so I did I went to the homeless shelter an idea of comedy\nAnd it was pretty awesome a lot of my friends I Would have been a laugh but here's the thing I'm not there to get laughs um they're simply to give them an opportunity lab and it just so happens they see the opportunity\nSo then when we do our next tourist season I'll just\nWhat happens they see the opportunity so then when we do our next tourist season\nDecide hey and ... in the cities we go to let's stop at a prison a homeless shelter abuse children facilities unless do comedy there before the big show that night\nSo it was bananas like in in the stories I Would hear from these homeless people in these abused children are caregivers were crazy so one item on stage were about twenty two hundred people here and so when I Do comedy out and you notice because you think so it meant like you're you're never really\nI mean if you want to be in a moment you are but you can be far ahead of the moment\nI Try not to be in the moment yeah I'm running for myself right now you're not even in right now right now actually I'm already I've already moved on in my mind the already gone cool before you leave to further so as a comedian I'm normally presented joke number one\nBut at the same time I'm doing the math on what joke number two should be based on how you respond a joke in World War I and then I'll move on to joke number three and start doing the math on how that joke will go based off all your cold respond or job number one and probably will respond a joke number two\nPeople do not know that ... comedies that cerebral right but seriously that's very absolute was doing that on the fly while you're being funny while you're thinking about the\nSo I used to go seven jokes deep and I wouldn't know but but the reason I'm doing as 'cause I'm trying to get laughs when people what joke is going to get more or less what joke is going to get more or less but since I had to shift in mindset the question I'm asking in between the jokes is really what can I give to this audience\nThat did this come as a result of your face or was this before the faith thing happened\nHow this was after I became a Christian for sure was because I just really feel like I'm here to really help people and most of the time that the laughter but if it's something else I have to be willing to give that as well so I'm On stage is twenty two hundred people deserve it and I feel like I'm supposed to share one of the stories\nFrom the abuse children's facility I was at earlier that day\nWhich is crazy because the story is not funny\nIt's not funny abuse children is not not not a place you go to get laughs\nExactly but remember I'm not there to get last I'm there to give them opportunity and we had been laughing for probably thirty minute ... mhm so now I feel like I'm supposed to share their story and I share them I'll tell them about the little boy who is being abused by his mom she's on drugs and want to bring she was doing she was pulling out is toenails\nSort of whole room is froze you can imagine there are laughing at all and then she the grandmother explained to me that the little boys so afraid of his mom everywhere he goes he wears a spider McCosker\nSo now it's time for me to do a show for for this little boy his caregivers and all these other abuse children and I'm On stage and I know all of her stories\nNow if my mindset was to get laughs when people there's no way I Would have been over there to show what it was giving them an opportunity last so I had to do to short part of my Simon [noise] so do the show or twenty minutes in and I hear a voice in the voices my name is Sharon in in this little boy was all this mask\nAnd you were done but we actually put we posted a video of all you do like it is ... so I tell this to my live audience and they're just done and you think\nNo more or less going to happen after this because before that were on a scale won't attend were laughing at like seven and a half\nDuring the store we drop to zero after story aired we'd probably jumped up to twelve\nAnd it's not because they were insensitive is because we went I gave him more than just funny which is what the movie is too we actually went and found a country if found three stories and filmed them just like that so in the middle of the jokes you go from stand up\nTo abuse children from stand up to special needs kids from stand up to adopt a family and it's pretty powerful\nI had to say that you know as I'm listening to talk you sound like an incredibly nice guy and I know for a fact you're not [laughter] so I just want to say this has to be God you know what I'm saying one hundred and he got because personally I Know you're just not this nice yeah and they actually their mind by the way you\nKnow I Want to know that you are in case you didn't know though are nice ... are usually in Nigeria right is this is [laughter] it's just so\nI mean it's hard to surprise me on some level like what you're saying is very daring I mean to do that\nTakes real courage and also I Would say incredible self confidence and I don't just mean in yourself ... incredible maybe I'll put it this way incredible faith in God that he will back you up you're doing something you think is right mhm everything would tell you do not do that\nDo Hollywood I took this going to some people say here's what I Want to do and they were like we don't know what that is and they don't it's never been done before now like this has never been done before ever like who in the world why would our it all started with me just simply ask the question what can I give\nAnd that one audience show me that they want people show up to laugh to be entertained but they more times than not they actually want a little more and that's why we called this thing more than ... on the outside people think is extra funny but the truth is\nThat I was just going to say more than title implies like an extra funny but in fact yes exactly yeah that's a double intended that you're going over there to now listen we're going to come to the end of the segment I just want to know do you have a last name other than junior\nOh so we'll find out on the other thing to do I need to do I need to like ... adults so that is actually at the end of the movie is that true [laughter] it's like a big originally you don't want to ... that's right that's right now that's not true it's not really at the end of the movie really no I mean maybe you\nGot to wait for the moment I don't do nothing while put the knife to I don't even know I don't even have to continue this interview then they tell you right now so so I was sitting here\nThinking grief from a funny man and let me just tell you something seriously when you tell me that you're doing this because I've never done standup but as you know when I'm speaking from some of the times I'll be funny or up to it but to go from that from doing funny funny funny and to this other thing and then to come back\nThrough funny three down on that to me is a unique I've never heard anybody do anything like\nThat and it's not like there's water now it's the same sort of comedy I've known on NBC's Tonight Show Jimmy Kimmel so it's the same quality of comedy but it just happened to ... in fact the comedy has to be super strong in order to go with these stories that are completely cut contradict opposed to the ... you know what I think\nI figured you out your Jesus freak\nThat's a compliment ... I'm also Jesus freak but that's really that's freaky stuff because you're walking out there talking about walking I like to sit out every net like wouldn't trade it saying it's like a super duper freak yeah of course the ones that come on at night you're ... or\n... or ... or should we can't go their brother you harvest okay yeah that's different than if it OK folks are you stick around\nWhen we come back we may find out the last name of my comedian guests Michael junior or\nBe it might be going to be right back with Michael junior\n[noise]\nMidterm elections are right around the corner and it's obvious ... will do anything to win\nYou may not realize that even your cell phone bills used upon liberal cause so switch now to the nation's only conservative cell phone companies patriot and mobile patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited talking text and know hidden fees\nWas patriot mobile automatically donates a portion of your bill to the conservative causes your voting to protect\nKeep your number bring your own device or select the new one from our great selection including I enjoyed and iPhones beginning of the only four dollars a month [noise] ... mobile the gum to get started today and when you use the upper go news they'll even wave your activation people up to to\nStop supporting big mobile and liberal causes and make the switch to patriot mobile\nToday voter patriot mobile dot com or call one eight hundred a patriot patriot mobile dot com or one eight hundred a patriot one eight hundred to seven to eight seven forces\nHave view racked up more than ten thousand dollars in credit card debt are you barely getting by making minimum payments you should know the credit card companies are tricking you into thinking there's no way out\nCredit card companies would rather you didn't know that there are ways you can become debt free and you\nDon't have to pay the entire amount you oh there are debt relief programs that help people like you escape overwhelming credit card debt\nNational debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than five hundred million dollars of debt national debt relief help so many people there a persuaded by the better Business Bureau you don't have\nTo declare bankruptcy or take out a consolidation loan\nYou have the right to settle your debt for a mere fraction of what you owe reduce a large portion of your debt now called national debt relief at eight hundred nine for two forty seven thirty eight hundred nine for two forty seven thirty that's eight hundred nine for two forty seven thirty\nImagine a politician saying this today\nI had wondered at times with the ten commandments would've looked like it Moses had run them through the U.S Congress\nThat is a quote from Ronald Reagan he showed us through his life his faith and with his words the Judeo Christian values and principles matter you can help spread the legacy of Ronald Reagan and you can do it by getting a Reagan email address\nRight now if you have a Gmail AOL Yahoo or other big tech company email address\nYou help them market their service with every email you send in return they scan your emails and target you\nWith unwanted advertising well thanks to our sponsor Reagan privacy dot com you can instead share the Reagan named with every email use and and they won't ski and your emails they leave you alone get an email address you'll be proud to own at Reagan privacy dot com your very own personal private email address is available to you at Reagan privacy dot\nCom get your Reagan email address right now at Reagan privacy dot com\nDoes your roof and he plays in your house and they get for maybe you're reading your big or whatever you only need and aren't on the phone service and at home I turned to has on radio for him ... retailer an accent when you're ... you don't have any metal detectors and running out of their ...\nYou see how the enemy offering pick your own ... certainly magic\nDot com hung in my service dog problem that your dog ear but it's yeah you die young male looks perfect arc radio family so he's going to reprint one ... billion with Randall ...

sounds like you're discouraged 'cause you're libertarian they never win certainly any big offices and I I have friends who are libertarians obviously I say obviously because on my side but I Do have people Democrats were my friends and so on but the two\nParties it it's one of the civil in this country and they get elected to office you got to be Republican or Democrat almost always some small offices even a green green party lady who won in Los Angeles actually a friend of mine\nWas small office community college board but she wanted and I'm as a Green Party member so it can be done but the big offices\nWith all the structure and need the requirements to get on the ballot or certainly for president a working your way down to it's too difficult in a lot of people\nAre going to support you for a third party to make it so that the I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo that that that I was like a steak I'm Sorry mark up some of it you know what\nBut what it does it it can troll ... April it controls that I mean it it is what it is and and you know when I hear you say you know people hate ... or they have this you know hey is a very powerful word\nTo very powerful word\nUm you know I Do some of the people in the other party I mean I'm a I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump's do it um you know I I Can't believe that he's not a Kennedy by now\nUh you know and the mob India however you know I hate saying it it it it's over taken a\nDay and and you know I grew up in the eighties we didn't have this kind of hay and uh you know it it it's really hard to swallow watching my you know kids grow up in a hate environment and I don't like that word\nMhm [noise] well I I understand that you know I and I appreciate your call I understand that you don't know I'm Glad you didn't say you hate that word\nBut I understand that and the ... but that's what is going on and that's why I said we ... it looks like we're in the second civil war notice I didn't see that I said that the I think Democrats Mr misinformed and they think we're evil so that's that's a big difference right there\nLet's go to a\nThat is Joe in ... Virginia Joe you're on with mark\nMartin Morning [noise]\nHey I'm real good topic I I'm I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know on Facebook I've I've shut down based book just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um\nIt it almost feels to a point some times when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know a ... but with my sister even before the election actually happened um I I don't even\nI don't even think I think he was still between a cruise and Rubio said\nI'm going I'm going to put you on hold I don't want to lose you you're the first one I put on hold and I want to hear about your sister sister in law whatever it is and I started telling you also so let me know what you guys are thinking he's six six Ninety red eye mark for filling in on right on the radio [noise]\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day and the host said to me you know mark a\nHer father died and she didn't even know it\nAnd I had to tell her the news and she said I'm a while I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him because she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent\nOr their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up a topic because it does happen and it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nAnd mark is great to talk to you I'm I've been to a you know Republican and conservative my whole life then I went into the military right after high school and um it most of the people um\nThat I let it in the military where he chairs because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military Kay [noise] yes I kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me than I Am for them [noise] um and then as time went on um\nWhen I'm the first are you\nA Gulf walk him about\nUm I just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause at the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and um you just want it to listen and you know I found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started\nComing to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I Would be pushing anything on them and\nUm when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away for new friends and relatives just stopping my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I used for somebody who's just you know terrible and I'm just like you're going to stand by getting mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he still conservative said it didn't make our country better and\nYou know I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we'll be greatest economy in that we in this country's ever see you know we have I mean the job of trick truck driver so that keeps five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start that job\nYou know I mean\nI can actually jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech jobs to pay huge amount of money so sick you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck fork in construction and\nYou know everyone seems to be still upset and close to stand back and look what's going on but you know I I had a friend\nTell me right to my faith that I get so mad at you and I when I read the things that you oppose that I just want to shoot you and the head and she made the hand signal like with a guy my cat\nAnd I miss it so hurt by that and you know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and it just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't find the man that because she likes Donald Trump and I I just don't want to be around here anymore and\nIt it is hurtful and um\nYeah I had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of all of this I'm a transgender woman so a lot of ... on the right hated me for a chance up ... to me because I like Donald Trump and\nYou know my ... a lot of people my family is like me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a chance to people that look at me like how can you be Republican nephew chance she hates us and I'm just like not only does it you know and so it's like a ... all these angles coming at me telling me\nThat I'm wrong for being who I Am and I don't think that anything worse than life people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it's it's just horrible well\nI feel your pain that I had to use the bill Clinton line but\nI can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you you can't imagine what you're going through a it is it's tough enough or the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us let alone when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to [noise]\nIt's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and home of homes are all this kinda stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that made\nHim as a volunteer work for a Jeff does\nIs running for Congress in my area can Gerry Connolly and he kept out of it is an army veteran and his band aid on that is also African American and tear economy the older white guy who's been there for ten years called him a racist I mean it's\nQuite interesting\nCalled him a racist I mean it's\nLike a musical now yeah\nBy the way I've got I got to thank you for your service and then when my advice to you didn't ask me this just hang in there and there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people many good friends do you have and some people breathe say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better uh it it's tough life is very challenging and and can be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors are said we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else\nSo my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a real issue\nJust imagine the aside in this country whereas some causes set including my young friend there are all Americans in the final analysis John Kennedy said that even about the Soviet Union that we all read the same air you know what is this
