let's go to your calls let's go to Richard in Louisville, Kentucky Richard you're on with mark\nMark thanks for taking my call yeah I I think\nUh this upcoming election but the mid term elections could be a watershed moment teachable moment I'm for all for\nAll Americans um but I think that the Democrats have not learned\nTheir lesson or in the has shown by the door they traded Kavanaugh and the ... and the Supreme Court cheering\nUm they've assumed that could slander and alive or a person that they disagreed with politically um than get their way but um\nThen they do the same to go\nTo trial for two years but uh it's really come to a head was who was Kavanaugh's nomination and I think we need to use the mid term to show that clearly that that's not the way to do politics\nIn America that what what is needed in America is\nThe parties to\nTo debate the issues then to use reason\nOr two but you know they come yeah they they don't go ahead ... we have Richard\n... that's yeah that's been there playbook though not just since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes you heard from some of the middle later on I was a lie but it said it was effective well they'll do anything in the book and the worry is it looks like they could win the house representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years ago and I'd be like for President Trump and for all that's run\nThat tried and it's it's the idea that\nYou're selfish and justify your selfish mange um and that's what the Democrats are using as they're guiding principle um their self ... are are justified by their selfish lanes\nAnd a ... up and they also think they have truth on their side they're arrogant as I said and when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth then you can do anything right at the end is edge the means are justified by the ends right\nThe ... either way you say and it works because they just feel they can say anything and do anything because we're evil and they're good will\nActually thought they could overturn a two hundred years of jurors ... in the cabin on nominations buzz saying you're guilty until you're proven innocent\nYou're writing Richard in and we appreciate very much for your call and now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWhere you begin to wake hopefully a little more quiet and we began the week last week with hurricane Michael in view we also had a tropical system move into the desert southwest over the weekend tropical storm Sergio providing\nHeavy amounts of rain to the desert southwest will continue to see rain today in South Texas now as you move a little closer into Colorado along I twenty five you're going to pick up the potential for snow\nWill see mainly all rain as you get into Oklahoma and north Texas the rain showers will extend from central Texas today into the article attacks and lower Ohio and Tennessee Valley is clear conditions are bound today for a good portion of the west west of the Rockies the northern plains will be clear\nThe deep south drying out\nAnd the north east under a pleasant conditions and that includes the mid Atlantic region as we begin the work week there's a look at your national forecast red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout [noise]\nAnd it's hard guys with you all week on the\nRadio was talking about the lessons versus [noise]\nThank you thank you very much twenty five there's hope let's go to a\nOkay David you think people are voting for or dead huh God David in Cedar Rapids\nOK I'm OK what it is just a a a grandfather and my mother and my\nGrandmother passed away a notice that I joined the Shearer knows link county Republican caucus committee got people who are at the polls\nSchool a middle take a look at you know all of a you know and they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that you know one looking to records that for some reason my grandfather and my grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before\nDid you report it to anybody I tried to take some action\nI did it's just that you know it it was kind of like a yelling out of stone wall\n[noise] they weren't willing to um yeah\nNo ... this is a real problem with voting integrity in this country was known for years that people in Chicago that people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity and election system anything could happen it's amazing\nWhen you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won because I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud so that people wrote in in California you you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted there they said there was some snakes with voting machines\nWe got a real problem when you can trust the outcome of the election [noise]\nWell the thing is is that how the ... Republican a cock his committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids pledge that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my vote it's actually counted\nAnd so we all these younger people ... says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here but I don't trust\nIs being ... and that's how we changed from the Democrats city to Republicans city getting us last elections\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right if illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote the Republicans aren't going when another election or at least nationally uh in our lifetime\nSo there's no hope would you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States you brought up a great blow election\nActually got to get\nA little something there that they're [noise] okay it's all depends on how you treat the end of the\nTree unless people who may be here illegally\nBut are contributing to society now because I work you know many aware out at the agency jobs where there are plenty of illegal so we're working\nBut as long as you treat them like human beings are not you know being angry protests are illegal just realized that our system that child's for so long that we know integrated people that you know\nAnd uh and another you know way should have been there in the first place but because they are good to us that we are good to them [noise] maybe the idea that illegals would probably vote Republican does not out of the questions\nNot probably not quite as\nIt's not just because it's tied to want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is\nIf you don't have a way of entering the country legally then you're sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it yeah I certainly think people should be treated well but whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders or you don't\nBut I don't want to open up that can worms right now uh you know it it's bigger than just a few minutes it is not a matter of treat them well in fact I\nDon't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally they the great people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye that's also eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another call this in this segment Charles been waiting Sheryl in spots where does that New Jersey\n...
