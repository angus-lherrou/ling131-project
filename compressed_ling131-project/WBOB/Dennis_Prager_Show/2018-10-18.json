[laughter] you know I I Know and and what I liked cars natural habitat which it here and talk and try live\nAt mar a Lago ... and I know in the White House and I told him I you know in campaign mode and and so and I know it's ... and and I wanted to comment on his sanity using\nMy background may catch genes and human organizational development and I had you know as I looked at people within the contracts that they shouldn't than a contract that human development in the context of their education their family birth order\nAnd and and\nI see this president as perfectly suited for that China and I I made it there Sean Sean Hannity show and I stand by it can be quite possibly be the most person to ever occupied oval\nOffice that no no no go ahead go ahead yeah\nWell I said I think it's like my actual reality is that if people would stop and consider they could stop worrying about whether or not he's crazy she's not trade he is just very well suited for such a tribe that says go ahead it's\nFunny you say that honestly because the the reason I think he resonates with so many people no matter what you think of all the details and whatever and he's not perfect let's face it he does things that I don't like what\nHe has a really\nRemarkable a virtuoso level\nOf common sense it's it's really something\nThat is remarkable I mean when I saw him on Lesley Stahl talking sixty minutes the other day I thought to myself what is so funny is that somebody that I Love like Ronald Reagan I Would never imagine him going toe to toe with hospital journalist like Lesley Stahl he just wouldn't put himself in that position\nTrump wave in there and he goes toe to toe and most of what he says I mean they try to get a B soundbites and things but\nI I listened to my thought to myself this man\nHas been given a gift of buried deep commonsense to kind of rare\nIn life and when you see somebody has they usually are really good businessman entrepreneurs or something and of course he is that but to see him functioning in the way that he is right now it's it's it's it's come to my mind fascinating because there are plenty people you know this pundits are in the media world\nBut one thing they do not have\nIs common sense they may be brilliant they may have a lot of degrees but they don't have common sense and so it's kind of funny to see this guy with his commonsense on full display\nA constantly but it's just interesting to me that that you comment on that because you're in a position where the beach the psychology to talk about that into to assess it right\nTo marry you make\nPersonality tied have actually my back the\nPersonality type or just to see what the Briggs type indicator in my opinion it gets claimed here I Am not ever like logical analysis on him although I'm going to ask him for that on the next train him but I Am I but I just in an talk once you've done a lot of\nThat sort of has managed to take all\nYou know on the on the outside and that is the okay with my book and I know is it because he didn't treat about it but you know if you look at his family birth order this is where it gets really interesting and I won't go choo choo deep on average weeds but it it is fascinating\nAnd interesting burnt daughter um called eight eight first and last that double birth order and and he happened\nTo have the ... next sibling at the end it right heart is birth order to have both character traits other first born baby\n... baby we all know have ... children we all know the baby of the family of five just like he had five children like I by soldiers made it really easy for me to try to take a look at that age\nMaybe at any family that confident thinks everyone wants them to understand why anyone wouldn't loved them kind of curious tied but a lot of times with that personality type he also maybe a little bit of a diminished the responsibility to add a lot of big sibling to do everything for them sad\nSad if there's a large space between them and they're older sibling and that older sibling and younger so there are a younger sibling as well that they get to buy that makes sense\nThat it never ... birth\nOrder so they become a natural leader with his great Gary as close to the edge and energy and and total optimism that they just think they can pretty much do anything and usually they can't because they were born that the leadership qualities because they have a younger sibling it at all but it's possible for\nSo it's an amazing preparation for an allergy type on top of that in this business document and all the other hand if you already know about making very uniquely qualified for it but you're trying to get you know Eric I wouldn't that make you you mentioned Ronald\nReagan in ... he was always my favorite president prior to that but I don't think we need to compare president\nBut you and I and the rest of the conservative movement course meaning for disruptor to come in and do wake up the cartel that I'd become our party that was way too much for consultants and way too much deference to the media and all the rest of it right and this president\nYou need to do this I don't know that as you mentioned that Ronald Reagan\nCould have done what the president doing right now and the needed this president right now\nThat there's no doubt about that I find it for some reason I find the whole thing hilarious when I say all areas when I really mean\nSo delightful but I have to break out in laughter there's something comedic and entertaining about him because he will say what everyone is thinking and that's what you're not supposed to do Reagan did it really didn't do it on the level that Trump does but ... when Reagan said\nMr Gorbachev tear down this wall fry\nEverybody told him I think there were seven draft and they cut it out of every draft they basically said look you don't understand you're not that breaks the way we do things around here you do not say this and he said well I Am going to say it why am I going to say it's\nBecause deep in my heart I Know this is true and this is right and I understand where you're coming from but I think you're wrong and I'm the president and um the leader I'm not getting paid to listen to you I'm getting paid ultimately to lead to make my decision this president does that every day it's kind of like he doesn't know how not to do it and so\nNow that it hit a ball and I and and this doesn't mean that he gets it right every single time I mean I have to say I am angry that he said horse face in his tweet I I Want to smack him and say hey you are so presidential you don't need to stoop to that level but other than that\nOnce in a blue moon you'll do something like that he is saying things on a level every single day

seeing some really interesting things it's funny because\nYou genuinely have a a PHD in psychology so if we're going to talk about the the mental health of this president if anybody a is a in a position to talk about it you would be you were just talking about how uh the book by a it was is it Bob Woodward it was Bob Woodward\nOh of course who doesn't get him and Bernstein confused um but I have to say it it is kind of funny that uh\nHe and so many others are planning on this it's a funny thing I happen to know and you know this from my bone offer book which I Believe is on your coffee table then you know one of the ways they were trying to get rid of a Hitler who was genuinely evil\nYou know one of the ways they were trying to get rid of a Hitler who was genuinely evil was they were going to have him assessed\nBy the most famous like high tourist in all of Germany who was the father of Dietrich Bonham for Dr Carl bone offer and it's interesting thing is that they were actually going to try to assess him with you know the greatest psychiatry just\nLike you know in all of Germany now it's interesting because people confuse evil with insanity you could be perfectly sane and be evil or you could be perfectly insane and good you know but it's kinda funny people today like Bernstein and others they sort of think like look if I don't like him\nAnd if he's doing things I don't like he must be insane I mean it's kind of odd isn't it that that people really don't understand what sanity is they just think if you don't agree with me you must be insane is kind of a scary thought\nWell I think people conflate narcissism and mental illness I don't personally believe that I Believe first of all that knocks it says ... now this is my own theory and on and it can be completely clear because I've been attacked\nIn but the ones I called the book and you can imagine even pulled my weaning down on Amazon and everything um for my work\nI'm In it so to be perfectly might teach taken in organizational development I Want to say that because they attacked me because they said it's not in college he specifically well it's a ... at a psychology but whatever I I think I think is an effect on January ... know airing in research or anything else and I believe that most people\nIn show business most people I think we need and talk radio right they do get television shows like I Do every day on Newsmax TV um I think most people\n\nIt's a war hearing how much you know it's it is I think that they're selfish maniac they're going to kill somebody but I'm saying if you're going to run for public office especially that state level or higher certainly for president at the United states I think you would have a difficult case proving that you weren't and not just that\nSome some level rise spectrum\nRight and I and I put myself in that category as well about it but that doesn't make you change and it doesn't make you eat all and\nIt doesn't make you devious now are all evil people are probably\nThat's a different place on the spectrum of very very different kind of nuts it's it's a lego maniacal kind of noxious isn't that a dangerous right and I believe you have to have other mental efficiencies as well but people get really confused about\nPsychology being a science and it's really not Eric it's really a theory there's nothing you know it's not a scientific is global warming and\nI don't think that the scientific either and so you're right people\nHave to be ... yeah so I think one of the really important things to do here cleaning it and make with you on the state for we go any further and that is they started with the Trump pressure thing to try to destroy him because they don't like his ideas they went to the women thing they tried to destroy and with that now start of this paying his legal fees who knew that could happen\nYou know there's going to continue that I Believe their final effort is going to be to try to declare the president mentally incompetent insane or or perhaps with some sort of the generic mental condition that we have to be ready to fight back\nFor our values and the things that we've accomplished ... that set than working for for decades\nWell you're you're right and I also think that when we haven't mentioned speaking as a creative I think creativity\nOr in madness and I use madness in quotes but there's a relationship there knows if you're thinking out of the box and you think differently than others do people always want to call you crazy or you know burn her she's a witch because she thinks differently and I think that this\nPresident without any question is wildly creative his brain is churning in ways that\nA lot of people and again doesn't mean you have to agree with him but you have to give him credit that he's thinking outside the box and he's extremely creative he'll do things that you you know you you would\nYou could do to take classes on how to be president for a hundred

Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out of my Web page number of topics I said I Would get to die so I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first a segment at least and see your response\nThe issues really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone illegal aliens out of college last night said you know markets legal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss puts them somewhere or and lost them\nBecause if you acknowledge their come here illegally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here\nReally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and and another caller said that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in\nThey wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents similarly if someone walks into your say your bank and wants to take the money out of your account or right they were to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was there a cap and they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nSo I'll give you some examples undocumented in this case over legal\nLivable wage and and minimum wage right we we live with yours for minimum wage here's the wages that the government by the way the term that people should be paid which is\nRidiculous on his face and a free market economy in a capitalist economy as a government you know what the right wages for you and your business they're certainly not there when your business fails\nBut they're going to tell you how much you should have to pay your workers but of course people don't quite hear this argument and I could go on it's much more expensive than that\nHow about global warming or climate change right so they started if you're a member with global warming\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home Romney actually had a right to use the wrong language stuffed up whenever we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no benefits I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be staying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like ball legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and the shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have a blended\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end the loop legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine

again take your calls and eight six six Ninety red eye and we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see with Fred in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well I don't have a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring saying that that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and\nThe liberals are not a liberal that's called radical they actually taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this so when they when they walk in American you know we think\nThat it's just sitting here thinking the other side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff St grain wars when we say Americans and they they say American say brainwash us\nTo think that we're saying citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American book when you look at your passport if you have one that says US citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate what what state are words have got to be deliberate and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words and\nThat's what I said\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refused to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them usurp that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit now where Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America when the United states of America America usa whatever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call but that's my take on it and now you're a national forecast for cobra electrons\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nRain for Texas continues today\nWe're looking at close to two months worth of rain forest some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA little too warm for snow in Denver we overnight low thirty four high later today at fifty nine\nIt's winter weather preparedness week in Colorado a reminder that winter weather can arrive quickly and oftentimes without warning and the high country and there is today is looked at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout\n[noise] and I'm more Chrysler and I want to know you're taking a legal immigration at eight six six Ninety [noise]\nKnow and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and is not our problem right and there's your problem\nAnd then you can also add onto that we're going to stop the stuff you know\nAnd I know there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is terrific you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe insurance interest and we can make money interest you know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou better than I Do [laughter] I don't think [laughter] that's a\nGreat call things Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I send them to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what\nA ... it's tough and and that's one of the new stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president and I'd say if you could say well to New York trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days if they get in power not only hearings and subpoenas but do you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know what I Do I pay what I'm supposed to pay and do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff as they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve ... especially people that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those said hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they are much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and says don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I've given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights your going to have an energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that it shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think ... mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this is the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and and the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye\nMeanwhile I'm wrong about illegal immigration gimme call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven
