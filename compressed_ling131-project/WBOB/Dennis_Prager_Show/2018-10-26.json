I was I had a\nTough sometimes may have all their plans but have you told me I'm\nCodes and can talk so Clay Aiken pretty ... to the high school aged carry I think you're insane I'm I Am but yes well that I'm right at so basically\nI had this goal to be a bad housewife and that stuff about Mormon women are are bad condition to believe that that was said\nBy the way I actually am not a Mormon but I think that's a great thing snow I mean women I've ever met her were housewives\nHey hey you will not hearing me saying that in fact it really upset me actually when uh the Democratic I forget her name she was insulting ... around me and said that she'd never worked a day in her life and I'm like the woman gate or at the five boys\nFor that we weren't ... will add ... million kids she could just stay home and baked cookies and you realize that well in in a way housewife has itself ... Oprah Georgia because it's really\nInaccurate in the sense that anyone who has raised children full time there is infinite work infant at work and that's if you're not home schooling them and I meet women who home school because I'm thinking you were a teacher a year like this is just\nIt's kind of you know stunning what is involved so yeah let's let's so let's start there\nYeah I guess I I never planned to have paid work I should say do I plan to raise eleven children which would have been a lot of work a which is of a different kind um and so yeah\nThere was three you can go you can go to his own defense and stuff and I'm In a little bit easier [laughter]\nUm [noise] but basically a and again yeah there's nothing I I I I think true feminism is is empowering women to make whatever choice they want whether that staying at home and raising families or working and doing a hybrid or fulltime working and not having kids I embrace all of that so [noise]\nUm but as far as why I chose journalism funny enough part of it was I just thought it would be a non threatening major that wouldn't I'm a threatened\nMale Mormons who might want to date me because I wasn't studying something harder and I could just be a nice little uh like maybe freelancer on the side of the ... but I wouldn't have to worry about threatening someone and this is my thought process but ah at any rate I get to BYU and ah\nEventually through a my journalism courses and just doing research I came upon a lot of information that ah with outside the official curriculum that really troubled me about uh the Mormon church in terms of\nThe lack of transparency the lack of uh just the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were ... whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this um\nPristine image of Joseph Smith and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime you know ... and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that uh you and document them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're right completely I\nThought when I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wise that they were young like what what would you like\nThat like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also if they were married to other men because they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to have an\nOld ... ... ... [noise] that's interesting\nYeah and you know and again look I'm not a member anymore and the church has its own responses and and the church uh also will say well he he obviously was a flawed man and

though in your life you did something really important I was not really clear on this you had left the Mormon church but you said for like twelve years you were kind of non stick and then something

you became domination yet\nThat's just to be clear I'm usually are baptized as long as you want\nAnd how much you're eating domination yet\nYeah that's just because I'm usually are baptized as long as you want to be clear and so yeah I Would\nSay Mormonism is Christianity it is I I just think sadly that they they put a lot of justice Smith into Christianity and that\nThat's that's a that's a big conversation a ... I don't want to know there's no time but that's the conversation is it Christianity or I read it\nNow and in fact I saw my might to Mormons are except for journals because of the founding type kept a journal since I was eight I was baptized when I was eight ... more than a kid I kept a journal since I was I read my journal as a young girl and even at age eleven and twelve I was talking about how much I Love Jesus and at the time I ate it I said\nI Hope that I never forget how much that I Love Jesus\nAnd I went back and found my journal I was like they carry a baby carry you just yeah for twelve years you that didn't happen at so ... for a lot of reasons but I think that the biggest problem is that a Joseph Smith inserted his own and go into the Christian faith in his interpretation\nOf I mean and there but there's a lot of doctrine that's not agreeable and when I joined\nFor me was polygamy a and a big part of why at lots of reasons but\nWhat about all all of them who they who they say Jesus is or isn't through you know the\nNature of of Jesus in God and ... yeah right exactly it's there are lots of things that are at outside the Bible but so you so much for the core of of Jesus as the son of God that's there's a shared belief there\nThat that and that's what makes it so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care or it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well God looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nOr if you really honestly love Jesus and you you know your worshipping him in your heart then it's ...

suspicious packages and write potentially suspicious packages and I think it's important and I you know you just you just wonder I mean now we and we'll get into this year and a little bit\nNow you know we know the trail they're down in Florida but the mother played you know looking at the New Jersey whatever you're getting all these leaks\nRight but nobody has leaked\nReally one of the most important things which would it would give would give ah you you would think the media would want the opportunity to go down different paths right right and so my first question would be where they live bombs are not ... but they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything well and and\nWhere they live bombs are not ... but they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything\nWell and and what I don't see here is is ah is is this an over abundance of\nOf of caution in a warning when we go back a several months to the Austin bombings you saw ... or the authorities in that area you know because they didn't know what they were dealing with right they were talking about how people in the Austin area\nShouldn't approach a any kind of package on their porch or even their own porch\nEspecially something they didn't order or anything else they had to be very careful about now there have been some you know a alerts out there but for something like what's going on right now if we were looking I think if you're looking at life bombs especially the fact that\nRight now you've got them all over you know it's not just in one location it's not just Enron area they're all over\nIf that's the case then you have carriers and you have a a number of people who might be handling such packages and also the unpredictable nature of someone who might be responsible for this that if these are alive than\nA that can be very dangerous to the public and what I'm not seeing as this uh this this great calling for you know the public to be extremely aware of this while they have been the media's been putting it out there you know saying this is this is kind of what they look like it's more about the discussion on the investigation itself\nAnd and and less of a public warning and and again it doesn't say one one way or the other we're not coming to we're not trying to get to a conclusion here we're just talking about what we know and don't know and what we're seeing and what we're not seeing out of this whole thing\nMy the conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I Want to be able

it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference and and and the type of a audience that you have there\nSo who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable by

the Commerce Department numbers\nAnd figured out that a significant portion half of almost half of the increase of the GDP since April of last year\nOr the acceleration of you know it's going from roughly two point two percent\nAnnual growth for the last three years under Obama\nTo from the middle of last year or two right now a two point nine percent half almost half of that growth just under ... ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I've talked about the flaws of the GDP\nRight you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there was in government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that ... is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect that\nWe look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy the the terrorists the increased because of that the increase in cost of of timber and steel and materials\nOr the you know the the housing up or slow down over the the the last a month a government\nAt times believes that they can\nAnd people believe the government can help the economy and at the same time manipulated into success ... by picking winners and losers and they can't look\nNot that there's anything wrong with increasing defense but I don't know um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector because the\nThe the what creates wealth what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector ... and the GDP a lotta times takes in government spending and the transfer of money as actual economic growth and it is not right yup [noise]\nEight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join us for the bona

through Sunday night high fifty three New York partly sunny today and fifty two with rain expected tomorrow your national forecast from red eye radio meteorologist John trout thanks\nSo much John eight six six Ninety ... if you'd like to get in also coming up we'll take a look at the latest polls as\nWe are now just one of the week in a few days from election day\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things have happened or that\nAnd with any president or presidential family but especially this well\nYou've had how much you know that has happened had been said um and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you for the call a this was several months ago\nBut you're talking about when you call someone Hitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility instability well wait a minute when you compare to someone to\nA arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers in history pure evil you are saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat that that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate\nThreats\nSo the call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president\nYou got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer that one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth that's very different\n[noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the or Terry in mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we've said nothing that indicates that in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion but let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you mhm\nUh his provocative nature may uh or offend you but what does he actually does\nDoes he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no it is pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do\nIt is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and is that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who\nAre committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw remote selenium there to well what you know ... from let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\n\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump well of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and\nThe other point that we made over the last couple of days is after the Steve Scully shooting\nA going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a a you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve Sebelius represent 'em ...\nSeriously injured did that change\nThe rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they asked it up to the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity\nOver the last couple of months that reality is it's not going to stop\nWhy we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech and they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that what will temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we've talked about you know also the morality the media and and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion\nTwo years of it never ending pounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defended and said look it's it's been ... the the law is against this president coming from the media had been never ending\nRight the source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you can but it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe\nYour sources well it you know do you have or the remember the indictments came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president\nRemember the indictments came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted that day you know no collusion and then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proven collusion something to that effect nope nope\nNo ... and asphalt that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of BS out\nMuch less a major newspaper because there was no proof none still is done\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them know that may change but what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative well\nThink about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days ...\nBecause of Russian collusion right and trees no precedent now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if oh no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nOn we're just ... I really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh he got there illegally he came to power illegally\nAnd with the help of another major nation that has the uh that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAnd ah he is he works for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing at Hitler was\nRemember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a a an election coming up in what eleven days yeah and ah and where they screaming about that it's gone silent now why is that\nIf you want to get in line for open now it's the friday show eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with ... radio toll free ... and my favorite\nUh [noise] I diverge in one parking more fresh food and great copy and plenty of clean salaries just telling the last time I didn't find out why we got\nTo keep you trucking cc are tired or some sort of dedicated to providing high speed tire serve cutting edge to thousands of devoted service\nOver Fifteen hundred service trial five minute alignment ...
