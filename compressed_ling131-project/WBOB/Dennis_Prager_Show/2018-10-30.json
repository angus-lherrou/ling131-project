were talking about ... were you able to read Jon ... the cure some powers article in the Washington Post because I was no\nNo I I I pay ... I'm I'm On blocked by the paywall too but but the the latest liberal talking point is that on one issue this psychopathic killer\nTo hate the president and called the puppet of the Jews says that hikes in his horrible words are from our our spoiling everything and he doesn't want to make America great again any didn't vote for Trump and he hates Israel and they can't stand any you know anything about Trump because he's a puppet supposedly Jewish\nJews Yes sir I and I confess I Do um puppet of the Jews actually one of you Jesus the Jew but go ahead\nA puppy cause\nThis guy Haiti one guy in particular that's in a God who is involved in bringing refugees into America and because Donald Trump wants to limit the number of slowly refugees entering America like the ... or a caravan marching orders from from Central America that\nThis guy murdered all the Jewish people but he happened to overlap\nOn the very edge is with Donald Trump on one political issues so it's Trump's fault that this happened that literally the logic that is\nI just want to say the strongest term it's possible that when people use that kind of rhetoric\nAnd when they politicized something is horrifying as this uh I Know that there's a lot of emotion but I Want to say that um this is not good for the country\nWe have to come together as a country we have to come together as a country and stop blaming everything on Donald Trump it's no different than when everybody blamed everything on Obama you can hate Obama and everything he did\nAnd consider him one of the worst presidents in the history of the world but he's still the president of the United states and those kinds of rhetoric which are unhelpful to everyone in America some respect for the presidency whoever holds that office\nIs the modicum we should be able to expect in our public life that's it and so when people when people say things like that I just want to say I think it's tremendously irresponsible by the way when you're talking about how complicated I mean let let's just go for a second and say imagine if I said that\nThe man who sent these bombs around how many ...\nI can and saying imagine if I said that the man who sent these bombs around how many were they're fourteen or something like that right now we're living in such politically correct times it's absurd okay he sent those bombs to all the kinds of people that I strongly dislike\nBut the difference is that as a Christian I'm commanded to love\nMy enemy so if somebody I think he's doing great harm and his my political enemy\nUm commanded to pray for them um so the idea that just because somebody had certain political views and he did this I mean it's really it's irresponsible it's childish to do that but what I wanted to say John I don't know if you have any commentary on this\nThe guy you sent the bombs around okay we're talking about the first guy a\nHe was you know what he did for a living\nThe was a male strip he met a male strip where he aged out so he became a promoter\nNail clippers and had the head out he a Ali ... I'm a I'm On the verge\nOf aging out also it's it's a tough thing when you hit your fifties you know the ladies that they're they're just not as excited anymore so I had to to ... back but I mean I joke but you know what how sick\nI mean how sick we're talking about a man who did that for a living okay I'm Sorry folks but um if you know anybody who's doing this do you take them very seriously what\nDo you find is brain on steroids okay it's frenzy for his brain taking steroids\nOkay not that there's anything wrong with that right so we fries brain on steroids he pretty much had to have the peewee Herman slash GI Joe hair cut I don't know what that was going on\nShe lives in a van down by the river\nDown by the river and the man was a promoter of male strippers now if you want to tell me what kind of a man this is I Will tell you this is a social liberal\nSomebody who believes in behaving that way he is a social liberal okay so the idea that we're going to paint him a as a conservative or as a Trump supporter I guess what I'm trying to say is at the end of the day\nThese categories become you name it an absurdity to say this guy who did this represents this most of the people who voted for Trump gag at the thought of a male stripper okay who grew up in Brooklyn moved to Florida and it living the van by the river the whole idea of it\nBecause he's he's Filipino and he's pretends to be an American Indian so maybe he can be Elizabeth Warren's running mate I don't know there you go I\nI just I wrote a piece over the week just before this horrible attack in Pittsburgh I wrote a piece about the mail bombs at the stream which which president is a friend to terrorists\nAnd I pointed out that these people are trying to blame for windows acts of terrorism that have no connection with the president at all um they almost universally gave a hundred percent pass to block Obama or uncle bomber his first political mentor\nWas bill airs bill ... was the founder of the weather underground\nWhich bombed police stations the U.S Capitol the Pentagon it didn't dozens of bombings he was unrepentant he went to prison got out and build up ... worked with him he'll get him on two major\nEducational foundations got a multimillion dollar grants or eight years got him onto political boy did they according to National Review\nAsian Obama were close\nPolitical allies they were close enough to trust each other to fund their own work and find each other's work they were hurting each other kitten multimillion dollar grants on foundations\nThis this was a close this actual terrorists who planted bombs himself with a close friend or foe Clinton okay I'm Sorry of rock Obama and Morocco power when he was president\nCommuted the sentence and release from prison after Lopez Rivera he was the head of Chicago's sale of the F. A. L. and a Puerto Rican independence terrorist group that claimed responsibility for more than a hundred and twenty successful bombings for between Seventy four and eighty three\nAnd a [noise] they killed\nSix people injured dozens this guy was sentenced for decades in prison built a sorry bronco Obama set him free and then if we're going to talk about radical extremism block Obama never dark and the daughter church until he came across\nThe trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago which was a Marxist church at it by ... right he\nPreached black liberation theology which is which is like communist ... liberation theology Latin America except that focuses on race war instead of class war that's horrible I went to church for years\nJeremiah Wright married the Obamas and baptized their daughters it is only ... good morning America air to clip of Jeremiah Wright ... yelling God damn America\nThat only then did Obama rule actively distance himself from I met I Love what Jeremiah Wright said about it\nHe said many Jews aren't going to let him talk to me I told my baby daughter that he'll talk to me in five years when he's a lame duck or an eight years when he's out of office so far up Obama's spiritual mentor\nWas an anti Semitic Marxist his political mentor wasn't weather underground terrorist any set a Puerto Rican nationalist murderer and terrorists free from prison\nNow you why didn't we hear about\nThat well I did this gets to the to the heart of the matter is that the reason Trump was elected and the reason\nFor the GOP will probably prevail in the midterms if everyone votes\nIs because I think that finally in America there's an anger\nAt the mainstream media people realize that for decades or the truth has been kept from them and I and I think it's been a building thing but when stuff like this comes out and you see the way it's reported its grievous than in the United states of America\nA mainstream news organizations don't even try to split the difference they go all in on condemning the president as somehow guilty there's I mean the fact that here's some powers ah whom I consider a friend and a sister in Christ\nWould say something bad incendiary\nIs baffling to me I must say it is baffling to me Jonathan Merritt also tweeted something along those lines it's baffling to me that they would would ratcheted up the rhetoric to they're not there were ... well that's their right but it's now you're going back more from them so we'll be right back talking to John's American the taxes show stick around\n\n\nKelvin I I always talking about really factor but it was better to hear from somebody else so today we're going to hear from and here she is\nHas changed my life as the only thing I can say an exercise thing for years\nMy shoulder isn't bad bad shape and swelling at her I don't know during the night well I heard about ... factor on the radio and I've been hearing testimony for a couple of years I said I'm going to order really factor\nBecause I Need help I was sleeping setting up for five years of pillow in my back\nAnd now I'm sleeping flat on my back with one pillow\n... this is amazing I I begged my relatives to take this I was at a wedding recently I'm begging them I'm saying look you've got some pains\nTake this in three weeks you know if it works for you you're crazy not to try and by the way it's cheap like ...

economics those are the things that really really dry but those are the passions that we had because we we understand we believe that that's what will make the country great or not great\nMhm and it has gotten harder from\nThirty years ago until now when I started to get to that point you and I are determined that's what we're going to do not that we're going to ignore or anything else\nBut you and I've had this discussion we're going to you know we we want to make sure that you know that's what we love doing we're not going to get down into the sewers everybody does it or not everybody but a significant portion of the media does each and every day ... it gets to be ridiculous and it gets to be childish\n\nWell it doesn't serve any purpose really no it doesn't um and and that's that's the the um at times it can be amusing but but but frankly it's it's useless altogether\nOr there is no real purpose for it or when you talk about the the basic fundamental ideas and then talk about those ideas being implemented U.S policy that's where it starts to come together but nobody wants nobody wants to have a conversation anymore but don't\nI I just think the the ah the art of debate the

actual scientists\nWrite a national debate of scientists from both sides by all not at first round that part of our politicians\nThat that that and that's that's the that's where it's going to end I mean we're never going to get to the scientific community because again you can create the smoke or ... or\nOr scientists were strictly political agenda who aren't challenged that moment by another scientist and that's all we're asking for\nReal technical think about that on that issue the Democrats claim is the biggest issue that is destroying the world does anybody ever remember one national debate\nOr a discussion between those who believe that climate change is caused by man and those who aren't sure versus those who say no no no never\nThat's the state of the United states when it

eye radio a meteorologist John traveling\nSo much John eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n\nI just don't I mean blaming Trump for everything pretty much everything that's wrong and things that are drawn\nI heard someone say the other day about the economy well but it would be a lot better if\nLook we've had that discussion on terrorists and everything else but the fact of the matter is is right now the economy is looking fairly healthy the question is will it be sustained if the terrorists day in place\nAnd they were it but this was this wasn't even on terrorists\nThis was just a comment basically on if it weren't Trump anybody but Trump would have a better economy\nWell that's just blatantly false\nBecause I don't know of one Republican that would have gotten that down to Twenty one percent on the corporate tax rate I don't know of one Republican that was going to get tax cuts anywhere below thirty percent\nI can guarantee anybody who said that was not able to back it up\nNo okay well of course not as just as just as they're not able to back up you know him being an anti Semite or him being responsible for this or that they can never back it up what did they ever been a recently what did they ever been able to back anything that\nThey don't have to blame Trump it must be awful easy enough of a target\nBig red barn that's what he's become\nA Democrats this is from MSN dot com Democrats are sounding growing alarms and the final push before the midterm elections that the party lacks the message it needs to combat President Trump and went back democratic majorities in Congress is and\nWe haven't had a real message since the last presidential elections so wide change it now said democratic strategist\nChris ... we had no message in twenty sixteen we had no message in between you have no message going into this election you have to give people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else\nDemocrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact that they're voting base is fired up\nOr to send a message to Trump polls have tightened however and there was a recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base the narrow path\nThe Democrats won saw for the Senate majority has largely disappeared ... in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of a message it's just not there and that's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable said could finish nobody should be surprised if it's a good night or\nA bad night\nAh Democrats found a winning formula in two thousand six when they captured both chambers with the promises to champion a series of specific policy proposals\n... early the following year including the minimum wage hike and cuts in student loan rates this cycle they've replace that design with a shorter slate a broader themes a preferred blueprint in their eyes because it allows democratic candidates to tailor their message to the concerns\nAnd demographics of individual districts sounds like a hope and change philosophy right since Sacco ah this is not a national campaign said Nancy Pelosi\nOr it's one district at a time you had Democrats outside capital or voicing concerns that a blurry or message could haunt Democrats at the polls if voters are left on certain what the party stands for Rahm Emanuel the Chicago Mayor and former chairman of the house democratic campaign arm said his party needs to be more clear and his message for the country\n\nOr I don't want to say we did everything right into six but we had a six and six agenda a set of ideals are that are very clear\nA second democratic strategist that Emanuel makes a great point I couldn't tell you exactly what we stand for no so in that sense I think Romney's right at least back then we had a target we knew what we needed to do to get there I Can't say the same now\nAnd that's troubling\n\nThey talk about democratic leaders are quick to reject that notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and fighting government corruption by the way the fab fighting government corruption if there isn't a more useless campaign issue to go on\n... by the way any government corruption when you think of a government corruption\nFor the Democrats what would you think of\nIf I write for a Democrat if you're a Democrat I mean you're well if you're an American ride to Democrat or Republican Russian collusion right and we know it was the Democrats who colluded with the Russians not the\nNot the not the Republicans there's no evidence of it ... and any government corruption that you could look at right now and I don't know they claim they're running I I'm On corruption I don't know where I haven't seen an ad on\nCorruption but it by one thing but if you could promote if they wanted to get away ... or if they wanted to help eliminate any type of corruption or wrongdoing and the process is a support voter id\nCertainly they are pressing for that right yeah I think they're talking government ... right I Know but you start with the idea that because that's where it comes you know you come down to all the voter fraud situations and you often have officials that are involved in a\nShow\nBut the biggest my my point was the biggest ... the biggest question on corruption is the Obama administration and the FBI and the department of justice and our intelligence agencies it is on the uh the size of course\nRebuke in the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens when it comes to secret warns those are the things that we used to view the I'm when I say we [laughter] I meant we all but specifically liberals used to care about\nUh up until about a month ago yeah ... well they cared about that since Trump spinning off well no I mean the ... if you think about the Russian collusion thing they cared about that all about 'em on\nRight on right than it disappeared and I haven't heard anything on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now it's that ...\nThe thing on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now it's that Trump is responsible for uh the suspicious packages are and the synagogue shooting and the most evil an heinous acts bats and the ... when the glare of the Caribbean mhm\nBut the caravans Trump's fault that the by the way
