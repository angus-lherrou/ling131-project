grandfather that and I don't pay folks it's Monday lawyers are a lot to talk about today who boy oh boy oh boy I'm first of all\nA we had ... I was away in Atlanta at a wedding ... right before I was all dressed up before I had to walk to to the wedding like to be there on time you know they had the vote for Kavanaugh while and I have to say a\nWord living folks we are living in weird times we are living in weird times in the United states of America is a women it it sounded like women's voices screeching ... in the Senate gallery\nI thought to myself if you want to be taken seriously is this how you behave well I mean it's just it's just so bizarre that in the Senate gallery I mean these are people who you know it's a huge privilege to sit\nIn the Senate gallery in your ... as you go in there they knew these like professional activists knew that they were going in there to do this\nAnd I thought to myself there's so many little pieces that you just put together first of all that the screaming and screeching was so\nAnd it was really animal lipstick and was it was gross ... screech is a joy that no no it was horrible it was hard but it but it was really like an animal lipstick shrieking and and and you know of course Mike Pence who's presiding had to you know athletes are journal arms to take care of these people and and to take them out so I thought to myself\nThis is so sick sounding and on the TV it really I'm not getting it sounded like demons screaming at some point to get very ugly right\nSo on Twitter I posted the demons you know screaming in the Senate gallery the there's there's shrieking because they know their time is is is short or something like that right\nAlready the there's there's shrieking because they know their time is is is short or something like that right now obviously a there's two things going on first of all it's half of a joke right because even if they sound like demons but also\nUnfortunately only half of a joke because sometimes demons who are very real do scream through human beings and do manifest themselves in whatever right you know so I certainly wasn't calling\nThese messed up people in the gallery demons right on but you know people like we're back at me and how can you say that they're demons and even it wasn't even an article where somebody said that I called them demons and I thought\nWe were at a point where you can't joke and you can't say anything complicated you can't see any new wants people are just insane\nAnd there's so much to say to unpack this I I thought uh in order to an ... uh we need we need to call in the professional we do and so I thought to somebody who is possible who's Breaking Bad if we can get so many big and bad and professionally John's mirror because I Can't handle is I have to tell you it's so troubling so uh can we get John's mirror today\nWill be there and looks like the they're beagles not as willing him\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I think right I'm with a with pig snout so there'll be relatively you\nRide them with pig parts that sweet ah John's Merrick what happened this weekend then what's been happening over the course of these weeks to me um gets deeply disturbing because people some of whom are many of whom I Would expect to know better\nOr have descended into a kind of\nMob mentality that that says the motion is the only truth it's really something we've been living with this in this country for a long time but it's never been so high pitched literally and figuratively and it has never been so pushed a to this point we've come to a point where this idea\nThat emotion is the truest truth\nIs we're living with it we we've been we've been seeing it people don't care about evidence or ... and if you don't give them evidence of preparation they say oh it's because you're hiding it horror because the Senate didn't want to see it or it's just he you it's a never ending battle with raw emotion what do we do like\nYou know what I think we're dealing with is the last two learned its lesson\nOr what happened with the Kavanaugh hearing and I want to I Want to bring you back to um the screeching and the shrieking in the Senate gallery the other day I thought to myself\nThis is the kind of thing you write about in history books right there is a moment when in this solemn Senate when we're voting for one of the most important things you have the vice president nights they get all these assembled senators\nDoing something very very serious our whole democracy is right there and this is the tip of the ... ward sort of democracy\nAnd then you have in the gallery a kind of animal lipstick shrieking it was it was deeply unnerving to me it didn't just sound like people screaming it sounded really sort of dark and spiritually dark\nRip really it's it's not something I Would expect to see nature but said something I Would expect to see in a bad apocalyptic novels sold like\nGun show in the Nineteen nineties I mean\nIt it's like bad fiction I Know a lot of people joke that we're living through\nYou know an additional season at house of cards but really I think will feel like we're living tore Frank Peretti novel or some other really crazy apocalyptic book because the kind of things that are happening are so creepy and crazy and you're right it it made it in so far as\nI Would say Ninety percent of the protesters against Kavanaugh or not motivated by how they think he's going to have my rule on anti trust or ... or a Citizens United they are striking because they think he will take the abortion issue\nOut of the hands of the court and give it to the voters so these people are shrinking against the idea that Americans will be allowed to democratically vote on laws protecting\nUnborn children as well I think it's so important that this made in the hands of five Ivy League graduates sitting in a row\nI I think that that's exactly right and I think that's why this is such a toxic cocktail this whole thing because on the one hand\nYou have people who are so angry that really no matter what you say you you can't appease them and now they've been given this idea that oh ah we're appointing a rapist\nTo the Supreme Court which honestly no I don't I don't know how you know I tell you the truth John I become convinced that there are people out there they believe it so would such emotion\nThat it becomes true in their mind they think that\nShows into believing well they shut them when they leave it to ... well okay but that's different from they sincerely believe it like they've examined the ...\nAnd when they leave it to ... well okay but that's different from they sincerely believe it like they've examined the evidence and he also ... did not have good evidence to believe that Jewish people were form of a ...\nBut so lists like tuberculosis he shows to believe it and it it's fed his emotions that fit his ego and he and he and braced it all\nThe more strongly\nTo a kind of demonic leap of faith\nBecause there was hero evidence for it and he even formulated a theory of the big lie that will do the bigger the live the more willing people are to believe it because it entails a leap of faith that like it had already of the leap of faith we make in accepting\n... I was going to say since we're we're talking about these big ideas what we're talking about right now when somebody demonize is an entire group of people whether it's white men wore white people or Jews or in the past black people\nIt ... it is in every human heart because we are broken and were sinners apart from God we are sinners this is what we do and so the reason we have the kind of democracy we do is to help us not to do it so our government uh\nPushes us away from tribalism it's white everybody like my German mother and my ... father can become as American as George Washington because we're a nation that believes in something greater than blood and soil but we were I eat when you push away those Judeo Christian\nIdeas which are at the ... the center of the founding of this nation when you push those ideas way what replaces them\nIs a kind of pagan tribalism it's just a different kind of begin tribalism so they don't see it as tribalism and then they call for being a patriotic American tribal is which is ridiculous but you see this happening now that they are demonizing those with whom they disagree and of course ideas ceased to matter if you don't agree with him and they're not interested in your logic\nYou know I I I wrote a piece that stream dot org which I think you you ... your readers might try and find it's called Brett Kavanaugh's persecuted used the death squad defense and I'm basing this on or a member watching Ted Koppel back in the Nineteen eighties with this uh this uh\nEl Salvador and guy Roberto there'll be so we don't we're widely report it to be in charge of the right wing death squads there that were massacring people because they accused him of being in league with communist guerrillas and or do we saw was questioned by Ted Koppel\nThat couples and you know if there'll be some there doesn't report saying that your the guiding hand behind the right wing death squads\nWhat do you have to say to that and and as I remember it will be son had had a five five response first these so called right wing death squads do not exist the army ... communist Smith second they're absolutely necessary to stop\nThe communist third\nI have nothing to do with them I've no idea is in charge them fourth to retire at my first point they do not exist but fifth they're absolutely necessary\nOh my God that's the\nKind of logic we saw from the people attacking Kavanaugh you actually watch Dianne Feinstein during the questioning she would put up\nThe ... things about the ... the so called teenage raped gang Kavanaugh would show up and down and then she would go back and tell us and throw it another piece of spaghetti at the wall that would fall and then she'll come back to the original one we saw that I mean even people who they were so desperate to stop him that at the end\nThey said okay well maybe there's no evidence whatsoever\nThat that's Kavanaugh's salted Ford and maybe the ... and apparently accusations of what happened at Yale are absolute nonsense and yeah yeah they were lying about the rape gang but look how upset he was look at his temperament how can you get this screaming flunk an Irishman and put him on the Supreme Court\nWilling goaded him to the point where\nThey were they were accusing the ... of crimes he should go to prison for for ten Twenty years and he their absolute lies and he got angry rightly defending\nHimself and then they accused him of not having the right judicial temperament that's exactly what they did in Stalinist show trials and the nineteenth or an Nineteen twenties and thirties and the thirties when style and put his opponents on trial and he would accuse them of being\nSimultaneously a spy for Great Britain Nazi Germany and the Vatican\nAnd then they would\nPoint out that we're ... and self contradictory all these things or and and they would say I could see the cleverness you see the subtlety you see how how twisted his logic is he's so good at covering all his tracks the fact that he's making these arguments shows us what he needed spy he really is\nIt's it's so I mean I think that the only way to cut to the chase is to say that there is something of genuine satanic wicked innocent play I've ... I've never seen\n'em something that smells as evil as what we're seeing right now I mean they're they're they're bad things in this world but there are things that that are so nefarious that you really can see the hand of the enemy I mean there are good people that I Know\nWho who have been so caught up in the emotion of this and who are so upset about their own sex abuse or something that that\nIs taking the foreground in this conversation ... ... you know you want to say listen if you care about people not being sexually abused you better make sure that when you accuse someone you don't do it in a way that's even slightly paws make sure you take this as seriously as you want everyone to take it\nUm when it concerns somebody who maybe didn't do it and I think that that's what we're seeing is that we're we're seeing the undermining\nOf legitimate or the sex abuse complaints because now it's us against them it's men verses women it's angry people versus law and order it's it's become this this ridiculous um hodgepodge I I really\nUh as I say I'm I'm I'm really concerned for our country before uh we we return of this conversation folks I Want to tell you about a line suspending freedom as you know\nA shortly after the historic vote in the Senate confirmed Brett Kavanaugh as associate justice of the Supreme Court Michael Ferris he's the c._e._o. of alliance\nDefending freedom he congratulated justice Kevin with these words you said justice Kavanaugh has demonstrated that he is committed to interpreting the constitution as our founders intended that commitment must include affirming or most fundamental freedoms of free speech\nAnd religious liberty which will most certainly be thinking cases that will come before the court in upcoming terms now you know folks alliance defending freedom a second and on defending religious liberty has been telling you all this month they argue and when cases before the Supreme Court\nBut providing legal support for free to people whose religious beliefs are under attack costs a lot of money we're asking you now this month to help with a generous skip Carey donation will be doubled\nOkay the matching grants do halls and we'll be doubled a eight hundred and five five six twenty seven Seventy if you want to call or just go to a tax us talk dot com attacks us talk dot com click on the banner I Want to defend religious freedom we need your help these folks are doing great work for free but they need our help\nGod Bless you as you give [noise]\n\n\nHey album yeah did I tell you that I take real effect yes you do I take a relief factor because running causes me sometimes back pain or hip pain or whatever and lean a lot of people uh have experiences with different kinds of pain and you don't want to take something that is toxic right I don't wanna like nominate Advil or whenever\nI take a leap factor because it's made from botanical you can take it all day long uh for example a guy named Michael from Connecticut gives us his point of view and he says relief factor\nHelped to almost completely eliminate my elbow pain when I couldn't find any of the solution is a great product has helped a lot of other aches and pains since I started really factor I feel like I've got more energy and generally feel better\nBecause that's why I take it like I say I don't think it for my health or actually I Do not using it for my health but it it it's interesting because people I think think that they have to put up with pain my advice is try relief factor to the quick start kid is only Nineteen Ninety five try it for three weeks relief factor dot com relief factor dot com\nHi this is ...

victims\nI you know what I grow at once and I also think what I find interesting is that anytime anybody wants to frame thing as the men verses women issue\nThat's a failure and I'll say why because every woman has a father a many women have brothers and husbands and sons that they love to death they loved them they adore them and they would want them\nTo get fair\nA fair trial they would want that and so when they see this railroading maybe they they keep quiet about it because they don't want to get in the crosshairs of of someone angry and the family but privately they see\nThat when you railroad all men your real ruining them too because they love the men around them the men that have black them and and would stand up for them just as I Would my daughter or my mother or my wife or my

the northern plains there's a look at your national forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls the the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and rock Obama President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney\nOr on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization guess what happened in twenty sixteen\nThe RMC had been working and that the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that ah but the RMC\nWhere they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it ah after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and\nThat's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing\nThe organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the votes is one thing\nThe Democrats though have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion\nYou know and and not you know to look the other way with an Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worry about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would want it to change because on many issues ah they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do well\nAnd she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate\nWill that happens all the time that that that ... that that's dating a or not they knew the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the partying you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now\nBut the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on frets it ended television time from the mainstream media as a\nA candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nThat he has said is said you know they basically are still leader yeah the DNC has basically said she's the ... she's the future\nRight I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason that media turns to that is because they see what's going on with the left by the way you know from the outside in\nWho who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats while it's ... it's overall if you were to term it collectively it's the protester it's the extreme left but what's the problem with that\nIs that how many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Brock Obama to campaign for him in taxes is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nWhat you meant it though you know it's going to have an ... if\nIf for clues as Obama's going to come out and say he should've used my endorsement well that's what he does he go party will say he reached shy he rejected my endorsement shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree for president or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd now look at it today nah I don't know I ... yeah our our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want brio years after he's out now we don't want him wind made\nBecause and and that's it what what a Casio court chest doesn't include here is internally externally\nThe political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside\nA that's a course at the end and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if\nThe Republicans were jailed last year or as the president ah took office in January of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after Kavanaugh then we probably would see if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely\nBut that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a president in in in one year and then gone and the next well\nWhat's left the problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group it which moves in most\nRussia is coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go where are you going to be with the feminists are the trench genders because you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and in doctrine aiding children and and and young people to believe that it was that it's right to wake up today\nAnd find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday [noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into any more\nYeah I mean what are the ones who was speaking engagements and that but that Iraq take our but think about it shows you\nHow the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow the one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need as endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the signs\nBecause the less believes he truly wasn't the liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause he was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought they did and worked with his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety road I\nWas reminded my roast and car radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you
