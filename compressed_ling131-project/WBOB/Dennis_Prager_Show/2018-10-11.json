V. looks the same so I actually know what no joke I remember I was at the Nineteen eighty democratic convention back when I was a Democrat and I went to the convention was in New York City\nAnd I remember I was sitting up and I and I remember it was the last day of the convention this has Nineteen eight ... democratic convention so Jimmy Carter of course was the nominee but\nTeddy Kennedy had tried to rest the nomination from him which is an amazing thing and the two of them appeared on the stage it was like the you know the kumbaya moment at the end and I will never forget\nLooking and seeing Ted Kennedy was giant and Jimmy Carter was released small like a peanut and he Jimmy Carter's probably be but I met him he's my size right and but Ted Kennedy's a huge figure\nAnd it was so weird because on T. V. everybody looks the same size as for the first time in my life I realized it's deceptive because just because you're seated on the TV screen you know a ... and you look the same size as the other guy went in in person\nTed Kennedy was huge ...

I don't want to keep up with a little while I'm not going to give them an issue of you so I it's lord up there I actually commuted my mother had a demon for Thirteen I had to get on at three o'clock trade\nSo I literally just hopped on the subway this holiday they tried journal they tried to radicalize the whole subway here's you know New York all have strong\nAnd they try to get people to go after many you people yelled I got out onto Penn Station at ten minutes\nYeah I Hope I got out onto Penn Station at ten minutes I got a couple of calls I got a smoothie in all you see on this tape is guys yelling here Glenn chill Mideast crushing the country and Donald Trump or his ruling the country and he's been ... and that's because of him\nYou know well well you don't you ... you must have realized Brian\nUh but the media has made it very clear Trump is Hitler to point out\nAnd if you don't come out against him you're part of the problem you realize now what what's going on right it's very simple yeah if you don't agree with the edible if you don't agree with that or you're in you're in big trouble I listen I had a thing on the subway the day of the election two thousand sixteen November okay a bunch of thugs got on my subway car\nAnd they screen down in a very intimidating way you could tell what they're they're looking for trouble because they hate anybody on anybody here vote for Trump because this is like polls won't even closed yet\nAnd being a cranky angry middle aged man\nHe only won on the subway car I looked at these guys who are like you know Twenty one years old and I think I'm a I Will kill you like if you if you dare you know to say that uh we don't have freedom to vote in this ... you know I got my backup you know I'm from queens right so\nI said I voted for Trump and all hell broke loose these guys went nuts and when I got off the train finally this gigantic guy next to me he said hey I just want you know if anyone that I was going to jump in\nAnd there was another guy or an older than me who started screaming these get so you you don't realize that there are people just sitting there that they don't think this way you know so New York is filled with every type I'm Sorry very sorry you\nHad to go through that I think it's just fascinating because they were forced to pull it down most of the you know I'm not saying the most popular guy in the world almost every kid got was negative because people see I was not the right thing I did not give them a moment I didn't just and Donald Trump or Fox I think it was necessary\nIt was it was a bar fight or to build off by huge I'm walking the streets with a thousand people and then these guys yelling at Trump's stuff yeah then when they posted it the next day I'm\nThe most is everything was negative and in fact if you read out they were forced to take it out well off his Twitter account one private\nWell ... thanks to people like Maxine Waters people are being embolden in a way that is tremendously destructive to the fabric of the whole country we we all know this hurts everybody mobs hurt everybody when you have this when you're going to go start going after people it hurts\nEverybody and here he now says something the other day and I thought that people should you know everybody who sees hearing you know should go up to her\nAnd confront her whether she likes being confronted because she's put the it's a it's a terrible thing in our country so I just want to thank you for for keeping it simple I mean I Know your Long Island guy you your instincts were not to keep it simple but you kept it simple\nYeah ... is very strange is that because I wasn't close to a broader goes off Monday and are basically track the whole story through social media\nAnd I didn't you know I did speak to the Hollywood Reporter today\nFocus on jobs and even bringing up on the air but that gets voted off on a year yeah so I'm just curious where it's all his bottom line is I just thought we could say you know you go out you could do to try to what elections you don't get pretty you give you that might already took it as you can but yeah we have to go he gets almost killed almost out at second base\nFor a Bernie Sanders supporter of everything happening to all these other people like physically being threatened you would think at one point\nThat people see look over the cliff and say I'm going to back up I don't think this is going into a place that it should go well meanwhile Trump is actually show back to those records it anything but all talk he's actually all action\nI gotta say uh I I I may not know this but I'm pretty sure I'm going to be with you on Fox and friends to talk about my book Donald drains the swamp\nBut I think to myself we need

J. H. G.\nOr which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites\nAnd that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nA sea level they were confident that their staff what's got to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board to make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station in our system through this gentleman and garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did\nWas documented where he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I'd just be a ... is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday\nAnd uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing you know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope\nAh for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times but then as you mentioned are going live later and this is something that again it is too\nI think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through the storm and very few people relatively speaking had been through the storm like this but when you're able to show people\nHow powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind and that's what you hope to do you hope to show people\nThat this damage and how powerful this storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now a Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas what do we expect them next and the next twenty four forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect that his life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on um to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a near the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia the Carolinas and they don't need any more water\nAnd they're still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would not necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and I thought they were going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise]\nUh the wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they're going to update that with a\nWith an advisory they were given one hour advisories this was the last invite history that a twelve o'clock eastern time\nThat we'll be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories and [noise] and um and so it's going to accelerate and speed\nAs it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a I'm probably not by the time for off the air but twenty three miles an hour\nA forward speed to the northeast and wins are still going to be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour [noise] and so now above the surface where we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet when ... been already clocked I'm using Doppler radar\nAt that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms and there is one currently caught crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and\nInto making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and that thunderstorm translates those higher winds to the surface\nAnd so in those storms they could see gosh two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at it a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five\nOf the speed of wins above the surface\nAnd and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic as a as a tropical storm ...\nWow so\nWe're not it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving that way off in a in a general direction John trout great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's got to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or has some some some roots that ah between Colombia and Ninety five\nAnd moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham\nAnd so forth that are that have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton\nAnd Fayetteville and both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow to see if we have more catastrophic flooding and damage we can probably we can probably say for the next time we talk about turning around and don't drought\nRight right exactly ... and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of the water\nYou it's impossible to tell that so it is always best to turn around and certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale and later John ... will also joined us uh and and keep updated what to expect\nA in the coming days thank you Tom we'll talk to you here and just a bit\nSounds good All right
