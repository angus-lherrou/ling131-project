and we can do this it those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect doors no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of luck doors and Trump had a net gain\nAfter the election after the election because these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that the that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the but you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just a ...\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something to back it up and she couldn't do it you know I and\nNeither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph done and the therapists notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there is and if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only have we know that you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point the point is they asked her directly who were the people that\nYou say are witnesses to this actual event right she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nStand with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman asked asked for them right because the the story came out that she and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we were willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there and they weren't you have to come to you know had\nPlenty of opportunity or they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on the ...\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of you are a little bit mistake and it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that an allegation should be enough\n... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough ...\nReally is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well uh doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just to have multiple unbearable hide threat allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just say this was the mainstream of the Democrat Party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nDream of the Democrat Party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy they were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be bully not another cases but just this particular case it must be ... now I Know that they generally said oh woman must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nAh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test mhm\nNone of it and it was ... again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream all the Democrat Party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set up due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all her witnesses said they couldn't cooperate at well they know\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nOr the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that its capital as the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Cabot was up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right thing to division was not created by Trump it was not eight six six Ninety
