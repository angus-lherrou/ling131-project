could start one of the time listen I I you guys are so entertaining on every level so I I really want to know\nWhere do you come from what is your story how did you get to do what you're doing before we get into that\nWe want I Want to say the reason you're on here is because in a few days\nIn a movie coming out or you are the stars of the movie what is the movie\nMovie did you say that\nI make me cry we know that the rain and that's what we're doing it in a slob and expose them to hypocrisy he wants to run around and say we need to pay well guess what we did what I\nMean what are you shouldn't have drawn right and we noticed that stand out of it and a million dollar man on a one hundred and Seventy four thousand dollar salary and the people in her living in tents\nAnd it can be kind of call Congress out out the hypocrisy we have to write because what we the American people we paid them are actually\nGoing to do what we want them to do are we going to come out and we don't get ... to ...\nI I just want to tell you just to listen to you guys I'm limiting with joy levitating a you listen first of all the fact that the movie is called dummy crafts\nThat is so dumb I can laugh for a year from that that is the funniest thing I have ever heard obviously makes me think Fred Fred Sanford you know because whenever something so funny about the word dummy it there's nothing much funnier than the word dummy but the fact that you guys have stooped\nTo calling the title of your film\nI mean look it out of a name for the phone rang again in a way was do I'm just telling you only you can get away with it because of what could understand yeah\nSo I'm just telling you only you can get away with it because they want\nYou to understand yeah the name\nAnd what not calling them names but we're than some of the things that they do if I die I think we're going to go along with it you know some of the things that you put it is dumb things you don't even come to the table and I was telling somebody just earlier you Democrat that comes to the table\nFor civil rights they didn't come to the table for tax cut it with the vote for that right well listen right come at a table to end slavery they pushed to take a closer look at what they thought\nAbout it but most people don't know that as you know the mainstream media has not presented that what you're saying and in fact they're going to make you out to sound crazy you know a ... ...\nHas put out a couple of films where he documents everything that you're saying yeah arguments at all and he got no press coverage nothing absolutely nothing and the fact is what he's saying it is true and I I Want to ask people 'cause there's so many people love you\nWho where do you come from I read first of all I did not know that you were in your biological sisters\nOur blood system is they\nAre less right this is where you will also sisters in Christ\nOh absolutely I parents are pastors that's\nWhy I'm brand on the other you know\nWe have in a household so a lot of our values we weren't raised conservative even though we tended to vote\nDemocrat us right and that's because we work and and also when Trump came along and it is talking about I'm going to secure the border I'm going to bring back job baby can say we we ate it that Trump train because we were on it from the very ...\nAnd a revolution we half the battle scars to prove it and listen\nPeople were gone that's it the more they have the more we continue to advocate and we let them know just because it didn't mean you have to vote Democrat we didn't need any one theater nothing we can feed us if we can move to think outside the box we can't do that as well\nThat's right you need to get more passionate about your message\nSaying you can't you can't just saying and that that way you're going to have some energy when you talk okay now look around you just said the more you hate the more we advocate\nNow why are they said okay that's what I said why you write me so effective it is so\n[laughter] we don't even try to\nWrite it down to like the I mean are we giving you the truth we know what can I\nAsk you what do you are passionate about it oh no I was going to just be out of your life has no doubt about it and focus on a don't focus on the poll focused on the go that's right that's what we tell them that's right\nWell let me let me ask you something what made you decide 'cause a lotta people falling on social media and every now and again on Fox or whatever we'll we'll see you what made you decide to do\nA movie I mean and in the movie what do you do some kind of see this movie coming out next week what what do you what you do in this movie\nIn this movie called no hypocrisy we're going to some districts and see how these a cop with men and women that's supposed to be representing some of these districts out these pictures are are are are doing and some of them are not doing well with women they're doing okay doing early where\nThey stay behind their picket fence and they ended up with it even if they were calling and exposing hypocrisy we're tired of the people running around here\nTrying to destroy and we take on our country and on American citizens trying to discriminate against people based on the color of their politics were tired of it and it's time to call up the hypocrisy when I'm so happy that you\nKnow I was just going to say well you mentioned Nancy Pelosi earlier\nShe is the definition of limousine liberal when you talk about how she ... I mean that term has been thrown around but Jesus definition because\nShe always pretends he's advocating for the poor but as you said the irony and the ... that she lives incredibly well and and just go has the cascade saw so much that they now have someone on the city budget listen on the city payroll\nTo remove human feces from the streets and sidewalks absolutely\nCan you that and we have the way we want to write down every\nI mean we couldn't even imagine that when we heard it but what we actually went there and so we we was taken aback by it because we couldn't believe that it was true but it is true you have individuals desiccated there on the streets\nOkay but nobody's doing anything about it they prefer to hire somebody to wash it down the drain and try to figure out how to get some port a potties out there for people to be able to use the bathroom and making them that they're at and I said these human beings are animals that treating them like animals\nNot animal here and

I'm grateful that you're using your talents for God's purposes because your voices have become very very important\nAh yeah I Know you're both women of fades serious faith you said your parents or I'm Angela so you grew up in the church\nAnd what I've always thought I Want to ask you about this when I'm hanging around serious Christians black or white or Asian or whatever it is we have a biblical view\nOf sexuality we'd say sex is for marriage is between a man and a woman that is what Christians have always believed in so so many people I Know black people there in the church\nChristians have always believed and so so many people I Know black people there in the church they believed that with all their heart\nBut somehow they have been forced to be perceived as being in lockstep with the Democratic platform which has pushed very very hard away from that and it's even tried to say that uh the civil rights movement of Dr King are\nAnd and all of these great people of dignity that it's the same thing as the ... movement right now and I feel that there are many of black Christians who felt disenfranchised who say wait a minute wait a minute I don't agree with that\nBut I don't really have a voice in the Democratic party and I'm assuming that's one of the reasons that you came for long ah to to uh to advocate for Trump obviously who is a Republican [noise]\nI didn't like how but Democrats are the three of our country and if you had a belief that they were your religious beliefs and belief that we talked for for for years\nAnd they were basically they bully you know you can't have that believe any more I think that's what really outrageous people everyone they cook in a bad people up in a corner\nAnd what they were created a silent majority right and so when Donald Trump came along it's like oh I I Will give you a voice that I'm going to protect religious freedom\nI don't care what anybody do and the compatibility of your home but you can't push stuff up all the people they have their beliefs or their religious convictions out those beliefs so\nThat the Democrats did it for the Republican Party can bomb I did that he would Hollywood wanted\nIt up with the average American want it\nAnd people showed up at the polls we didn't we go back you up at the back of your head all of these people these women market in the streets at these little capsule\nAnd they had to do what we want to vote for him and if you look at president\nHave protecting religious freedom he's making sure you have a job he's he's creating the atmosphere is a good economic opportunity for you if you want to become an entrepreneur you care I mean he's got these past\nAlmost two years old bottle was able to do an eight year okay and and I love it though I'm not beholden to anyone but the American people working with the American people right now the president of the world I'm the president of the United states I loved him for that\nWell as I say it's it's just refreshing to hear you say these things and you know I guess what you're talking about with religious freedom and that's one of the biggest issues that I've ever talked about on this program and wherever I go giving speeches religious liberty religious freedom has become the issue of our day because it's one of these things that we had so much of it in America\nNobody really thought about it until more recently suddenly\nYou realize you're under attack people are saying not just\nWe want to live our lives this way but if you do not agree with us we will persecute you we will shut down your businesses and you know ... to ... and others they would have lost their businesses and some of them did up because of this kind of activism and that's on American and so as I say\nThat a lot of people have been pushed along with that and I think many people represented I Know many of my black friends who would have voted Democrat years ago\nHave stopped doing that because the turn step the Democrats took mainly under Obama we know it would have been worse under Hillary unfortunately Tokyo\nYeah here's a sad thing about it you know the same Democrat attacked the Democrat taxes that's being used\nNow for being used back then the way they mate you may be up there are certain way just listen to how Obama said that the jobs will never come back they're not coming back folks\nYou have to wave a magic wand he

an unelected judge\nMaking law making legislation mhm we go back to a sort of my or a when she was a at that the one conference one college conference\nAnd talked about you know a a federal judge making policy and then got caught and said oops I Know we're not supposed to be ... say that and uh they really don't do that and we went out there you go you got caught\nYou know that's the whole thing they ... they they wish them they want the liberal justices in there who will make law who will ignore the constitution and when we\nAre as conservatives and when the Republican Party\nAs Mitch McConnell did a few times when he was talking he would respond you ... where would you like your conservative judge sure I'd like more conservative judges and I'm just point no because that's what keeps and I know it's going to be political to the left either way but remember\nThe Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence and we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was burned in my ear ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent\n\nNever vote for democratic get ever ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that or by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the lab we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now all of them [laughter] [laughter] ... a reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo have you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that they actually hate the constitution of the United states in where I actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the basic tenants of the constitution so that we will get to that House

Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me\nIt's been there for the last couple of decades right now I Will say but it had been there for the last couple of decades it was there a Bush like I said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was the one who said well yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Romney was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNo as we found out it doesn't matter who you are\nIf you are on the other side they will come after us they will defame you their range will be amplified and will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe when you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe\nThat you know these these people have\nA critical thinking thought that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake wasn't a hero remember when Coons called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the process a that was until the vote\nYour hero until the the ... and it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the left they don't you're not useful to them anymore Beto O'Rourke does not need ...

are looking at again today for clear skies in the region the Florida Panhandle the big band in fact ah the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nHas now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west especially southern Illinois and southern Indiana along the Ohio River\nBend as you move into Ohio we get a little break but then in northern Ohio around Cleveland up through eerie PA and portions of northern Pennsylvania into upstate New York a chance of some slide showers today\nTropical storm surge geo will bring some showers two portions of New Mexico and parts of western Texas today the national forecast I'm right on the radio I made a urologist John trout\nThanks so much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves been working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect tours no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in ... they don't look at the facts and anything\nThey don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her more of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but\nJust something just a ... a preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something to back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh the what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph ten and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know in that because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we know\nThat there is and if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only we know that you know we know that are not ... but it was a ... a came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people\nThat you say are witnesses to this actual event bright she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nBand with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because the the story came out that she uh and her lawyer through her lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there and they have to come to us had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that there isn't anything of substance that the left has on the ...\nThe only thing that the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you know you'll never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males and the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI and a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of that you were a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe than an allegation should be enough\n... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough ... really is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well or doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent such as a matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yeah that's yeah so then you get what you want just have multiple unbearable hide for allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those well that's not just say this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThis is the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy they were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be bullied not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being sold the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilds mhm\nUh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test mhm\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is done mainstream all the Democrat Party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence\nWhen the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that are witnesses said they couldn't cooperated with the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nOr the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was a vote along party lines\nWith what what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right now\nIf Trump wasn't president if it was somebody up yet and he was cabin was up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right than a division was not created by Trump it was not eight six six Ninety red eye\n[noise] thoughts with ... radio toll free ... wrote a
