had and civilian aircraft\nGot hit a real big in in in July or last week economic indicators coming out that big you know because of the tariffs\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you and I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro but you know\nThe ... and they're telling him you cannot have\nThese kind of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish can be president didn't twenty twenty you got to reverse course got you got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second\nKnowing the administration knowing that look Congress is not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine NAFTA's gone and nothing replaces is\nGoing into the going into the midterms and then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and twenty twenty and you've just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe\nYou've got advisors to the president saying you can't do this did you hear it a Christian or was the one they say that was the one that that got everybody to come down\n... ... ... was the one right read that that might well really\nWell I mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing\nOr you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada if you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's it's not\nLess well look we so we ... we said this already that they're you know to try to to try to regulate\nAnd international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can't stop it\nBut again I Can't stop you ... you can isolate yourself but you can't stop it it's impossible\nBut when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were a day if you look at the trade going back in ... in fact a back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nBut what a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states and the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four tires and we were selling Mexico to begin with per capita that's their population\nFor every dollar they ... that you know they sent to watch we sent them three dollars they're smaller country they've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population\nOf the United states Canada as like what one eighth of the population the United states and we were\nUh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person in the United states of Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of\nYears per capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible oh there's no way you'll ever get there no I don't care how much more\nDairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states won't even be close no\nSo uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know both start leaking out hopefully in the ... next couple of weeks especially since\nNow goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... electronics here's your forecast\nWe're gonna pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of right along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nYou'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year that snow can come at a moment's notice but most of what we're seeing today falling from Seattle all the way over to Detroit\nIs going to be in the form of rain clear today in the northeast and Midwest\nThere's a look at your national forecast Retta radio meteorologist John traveling so much John eight six six Ninety ... [noise]\nThey they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that that was later it was all over social media on friday this is why we go direct going direct means getting in your face\nWhich means expect more of that were ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president they don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to come by his situation now he knew he wasn't going to win in November So we decided not to run\nThen he of course that's been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly but see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you can be an agreement for that disdain with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes in and he of course decides he's going to hold a vote I'll I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it\nOn the broad vote well\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well so now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation no it does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nHit is they've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope of this is only about ... the accusations but it does include the mirrors accusations not just the Ford accusations right\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to have been by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations and you got what the FBI going and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate\nThat's how that all this has got to work so you delayed it by\n\nA week or\nIf you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury while the house isn't going to bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\nShe the problem with the the Ford allegations is that you cannot they ... they think it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said I'll but he lied about his drinking\nRight how yeah right\nI just how is that I you know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAnd high school he likes very still like spear right you know and and\nYour because you would have to get down to and he said he never order in every city boy he never he said he never blacked out\nRight now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... which might have you know but but how do you\n[laughter] why do you get my reading that you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I don't I don't understand well you know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president because I don't know I remember\nA block Obama and the and and ah and\nHim smoking pot in the story of him smoking pot and I play in our lives but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know it's the better but but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell\nThen this is and then you got to push back of course on Sunday from a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk but essentially goes back to label ... labeling him Kavanaugh at such\nFrom high school well gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton with with ah with Brock Obama and others oh it only matters as\nIf he's if he leans right if he's a threat to the left then we're going to ... well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goalpost were first on friday a and part of Saturday\nIt was he's two part just\nBecause of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the ... that he was that that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot serve he doesn't have he he doesn't happen it takes because he's too ... well the part that turned into because then the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty ah sixteen where she said ah that um\n[noise] uh\nCalls Trump thank her ... she's getting involved in politics you should be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation at you by individuals mhm he didn't take on the city and tired\nYou too bye individuals' mhm he didn't take on the say the entire Democratic Party he said you\nWell and I have written in in one story a because there was no promise or that he could\nHe could a ... he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got Sotomayor on tape on record saying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\n\n[noise] the whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan that the president nominated now there would still be objections\nHe must be up to something that would probably be the objection [laughter] if Trump he must be up to something I mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice I mean it it would have been something some kind of objection but for the media\nIs that there is no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased as side right do you what first of all but they still don't get it\nRight but then they dropped that ... they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger it wasn't that it was directed that because once against Berg thing came out of the women Ginsburg has been political all the time and then they had to drop bats and they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as a petition\nOr the or the or the ADA too uh to change their um\n[noise] uh uh their ranking up him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of his screened or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts above Nichols holds becoming a goalpost because Grassley and flake let it happen they allow them to move the goalpost and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote so\nThat's on them\n... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nYou're talking about friday this ... they had the ... they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this is where it did change according to reports as flake was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nBy the way to the idea I mean the ab the American bar association or she's gone to them and said you know he doesn't have the temperament to serve because he got angry excuse me somebody ... it and that just beautiful ... they they sit there and they accuse you\nThey do not not her but they said without any cooperating evidence your and attempted rapist and you're a rapist oh yeah because of the you know because of the uh uh you know you're a gang rapist mhm and they say that and you get angry at them\nAnd so then they scream and yell and say you don't have the temperament to serve\n... beautiful mhm that's what they're doing now mhm\nJust keep moving the goalposts for because it's every you they know it's a ... this is the desperate attempt you throw not one Hail Mary but everybody's playing quarterback on the left now and it's it's like they're all throwing a Hail Mary hoping", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "01"}
