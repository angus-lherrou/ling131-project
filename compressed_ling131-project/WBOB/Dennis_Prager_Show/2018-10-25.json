Tate is well a Janet ... going to tell us she holds the father Michael me giving each year of life ethics at Sacred Heart major seminary in Detroit Janet it almost sounds like you're Catholic\n[laughter] it's just a little just a little bit I think that I Want the dog to live in\nA you know what the dog my dog my does live deeply within you and that's why you're on this program [noise] uh I Love it when he got ... billion people let me ask you question first of all she how do you pronounce it ...\n... just ... they're\nJust well okay because many day it's a Latin it's a Latin term um and it is and it's cyclical written by pope Paul is that right\nOh politics but\nPolitics okay so this is in the in the sixties\nIn Nineteen sixty\nOkay I thought so I remember when pope Paul was on the throne of Peter I was just a kid of course but he\nWrote humanity taken in cyclical for those who don't know is a major document produced a by the pope's and it's it's meant to be taken very seriously it's a very thoughtful it's not a speech or something like that\nInto many details I was at the time rather controversial now why was it controversial in Nineteen sixty eight when pope politics wrote you maybe take\nYour question let me get to know that you might be a can of human life and it was it's written on the church's teaching on contraception in marriage\nOkay now I Want to I Want to say that a v day of course is life it's where we get the word vital vitality vitamin\nAnd then of course you many as is human so yeah so this is a wide ranging um document dealing with\nObviously would sexuality but specifically with marriage and birth control there many of my fellow evangelicals who don't begin to understand the Catholic teaching on this I happen to agree with the Catholic teaching\nUnderstand the Catholic teaching on his I happen to agree with the Catholic teaching on this I think what is true is true there's no such thing as Catholic through the Christian truth so tell us what the pope Paul the six say on that subject\n[noise] well you know it it was controversial at the time but the because of various\nUm cultural developments but every Christian Church had been opposed to contraception up until Nineteen thirty\nAnd the anger comes from the sport were the first group that broke with that tradition I'm In favor of confidence in Nineteen thirty or they decided not on the basis of deep theological study or but on a just on again pressure of the culture\nThat spousal within marriage for various she serious reasons could use contraception like there was a little debate in the Catholic Church about that ... up until the early Nineteen sixties and that was because the when the invention of\nThe contraceptive pill before that all was available was um some ill fitting forms of a diaphragm and the ... when the pill became available people started to think maybe this was on\nThe contraception that wouldn't be Congress that that that would be um rejected because it in ... in ... physical objects in the obstacles in a way of the spouses\nJoined sexual intercourse um [noise] but ... worked on that for a relatively short period of time and said no no no it it it it\nViolates the fundamental principle of it like when Hitler to form in constant teaching of all Christians that\nSuccess is very much a design not only for but very much designed for procreation than anything that is trying to torch a and violate the pro created power of the sexual act is not an accord with God's will or sexuality after after all one of the first commandment you gave\nWas they fruitful and multiply until the earth\nSo that some people thought there was to fall right in Nineteen sixties and still do right I think that um the most important thing to do was to control the population and that the show is just going to be an awesome tool or to do that than the UN was starting to develop big programs for\nUm distributing the show in ... in developing countries are underdeveloped countries third world countries so the church was trying to figure out how it could teach teaching in the modern world and that's why it made a new statement there was one in Nineteen thirty one\nIn cyclical by pious the eleventh cold I'm On cost cost ... which is on Christian marriages on chased marriages and than sixty eight\nA him on the weekend which just was reiterating what had been a constant teaching you mentioned evangelicals I I have to say that over the years I haven't been invited to many times to evangelical gathering so to speak on this\nBut there are remarkably beautifully receptive to the possibility that contraception is not in accord with God's Brian um they might make a simple argument but I'm just basically\nA ... ... have this beautiful commitment to a typing giving ten percent to God right off the top and I said no God likes babies a whole\nLot more than he likes money and\nAnd they kind of look at me you know and I hate you know I I Will not say you have to have as many babies as you possibly can have that God loves babies that's why he he created the whole world was for a new human life I have this lovely even joke on come up to me after one of my talks and she said\nYou know I never knew how to think about this she said we don't have any teaching with us and she said I didn't ... people would say well\nYou know have you have you changed your\nYour white family size and she said I didn't know what that meant [laughter] I said I I I don't I I think that she suddenly stopped at four she said that we thought that was what she said but I think we would have had more if we thought it was somehow acceptable to help more fresh in\nSomething that's happening want the middle ... thing that happened with the pro life ... of course was you know and your calls and Catholics working shoulder to shoulder you and\nIt's been fantastic for for both parties I think that even jail hostess covered that\nCatholics on whatever they thought we were um\nMember members of some members of a cult I think is a members prayers are our term yeah well no I have to say that it it takes a intellectual leadership and in the case of evangelicals\nAre we have to tip perhaps to Francis shape or in the Nineteen sixties he was the one who really helped evangelical Christians\nUnderstand that the Catholics had been far ahead of this a head head of us and that we needed to join but first of all we need to get on the right page with regard\nTo abortion and understand that this is something that God calls the church to stand up for life and so I'm thrilled to see fifty years and not just that the humidity day but it but after France is a\nA Schaffer was talking about this that most evangelicals do understand that unborn life is human life\nAnd that we have to stand up for it but most or many evangelicals still don't have a beginning of an idea of why within marriage they shouldn't use contraception and I've had many conversations as I said I'm an evangelical but I I it's so interesting how we buy into kind of what the world is selling unless somebody really says no\nThat's not okay we just kind of buy into it and they don't even they don't even think about it and then they say oh and you know we've been married five years but we're we're not having kids yet and I think wow where did you get the idea\nThat you could do that like don't you understand that marriage means kids and means family and if if God doesn't but she was a kid that's one thing but the idea that you're going to pick and choose you could say well we want to have one point seven kids just because we think we can afford it and stuff and I think\nYou're not really trust in God and and this is very controversial but I think it's important to one of the reason I Want to have young\n[laughter] I Do not well exactly exactly and they enjoy the calls and Catholics some not so much from each other through the whole like move on I mean\nCatholics have been very um [noise]\nUh well he won't say at a fight by this radical commitment of evangelicals to typing I'm In a very radical commitment to basically leading the Bible every day and we were sort of saying well wait a second well where are we on this and so\nIt not just for that reason but for many reasons a biblical studies have just gone through the sky among Catholics I mean almost in so many are now taking part of some Bible study group [noise] um well in my lifetime in a new\nThing well if it's one that we learn from

to say to my uh my friends out there who are not Catholics you know God's truth is God's truth truth\nIs God's truth and so there's no such thing as Catholic truth what do we need to learn from each other and keep open mind and I want to I Want to challenge folks who do not subscribe to a Catholic teaching on contraception\nOr that they aren't to think about it and one way you can do that is by reading a Janet's book it's a bunch of essays actually Janet you've written in it but it's you've also edited other people's essays we had the great George why goal or the great Mary Eberstadt and others are who are writing I'm In the book why humanity tastes\nWhere is that and others who are writing I'm uh in the book why he many details still right published by Ignatius Ignatius\nPublishes so many great books I always look forward to getting their catalog um but uh we just have a a final segment to talk about this and I was going to say that isn't it true that there's just kind of a spirit of our ages secular spirit\nThat really is at odds with life it's an anti life\nA kind of I mean we it's been called the culture of death and so people say well I don't wanna have too many baby that's bad and you think wait a minute in the past everybody knew that having babies what's good the more babies you had the more wonderful a joy you could have in your life and I see these big families of people I Know they've got eight kids nine kids but I think\nLook at the joy you can see it in these families there's so much joy but it's not much evidence these days that kind of a family a lot\nOf people don't even know that they exist or believe the existence and think that but people that have a must be something really special special people\nIn a way they are not when they started but to look for maybe ... special special people I mean some people look at people ate and I can say oh my gosh I could never do this I Am having such a hard time with just two\nAnd lots of studies event that show that was probably the hardest right and then you have number three four five six seven when my it it just in a sense it still remains hard but he got that many more hands\nHe got into that me more skills he's got that and you really change your values your values are that you need every kid needs a brand new computer in every kid needs a top aligned bike in every kid needs a hotline that\nHappy with hand me downs and you know and the neighbors give you think that their kids for the most animals I Know lots of contempt Goliath was full of my clothes and bags but people given them because they only two kids and\nMy spikes and all sorts of things so I I think that um people have to see that I have a ... a talk that has called on the family as a as the holy upset\nOnce every human being to be wholly and he doesn't mean of course just for priests and nuns and ministers\nHim oh better by the holy and since most people marry and have children it seems logical to conclude that God would have actually made the form of self marriage and the family a pack the whole you know\nAnd as you have more children you become more and more generous more and more open to diversity and variety and an were kittens so different and and you have to learn how to cope with all these different people and\nThen when you meet their friends and the the the children of their friends and families and you just huge community built for your rooting for everybody I just I Love to go to sporting events with where there's all these families and everybody knows every kid's name and everybody's rooting for every kid and that goes on for a long time you have a lot of kids\n[laughter] so it didn't know it is so beautiful and what people often don't talk about is that whenever you the bigger the family the more you have\nWhat I call a family culture if a company become like a a little tribe and you're all when you use e also just uh you know we've only been blessed with our one daughter but I thought to myself\nThe more kids you have the more you see\nWhat your genes and your spouse's genes can produce and it's it's fascinating to see brothers and sisters from the same parents in some ways similar in some ways totally different if this panoply of a you know gene expression and you should just\nAlmost laugh at how different they can be and how ... and you you know you see that when you have a lot of kids and there's as I said there's a kind of a culture\nIn families when the family is larger and there's something\nI Would argue inherently joyful about that or at least there's there's a great possibility of joy in these large families and we don't see that so much whenever I have seen it I have to say I I've just applauded and it's been wonderful\nYeah and you know I Do want to stress that you don't have to have a large get a little to live large family values but it\nComes very well actually in a large family it's almost you know enforced it's you know

I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well hadn't Donald that's not the point that it's not you're not\nYou're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message\nIf they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out\nThere but there is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time we're we're we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nNo we don't know why that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and I said you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base and never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who are listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it on shows like this you've sought out information like this to were not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that is willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference it almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he used a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people right if you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me he turned it liked but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost\nThirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here [laughter] yeah right that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an calm [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time meditation oh it's like sitting on a beach\nSo like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree but then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no\nThat's not our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing it so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mass of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping and you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already\nWhat frustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely\nAnd that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely related to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack\nBack\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell and we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need it that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we had the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night and Nevada bill ... who vote on well almost big was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay\nCan you can you can in Atlanta who've been you know and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like ... political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar tree we worship a candidate and get still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it\nBut as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yes\nWell except for free stuff\nYeah yeah ...
