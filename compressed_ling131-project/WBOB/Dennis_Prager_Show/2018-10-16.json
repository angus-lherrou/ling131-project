I'm getting now can be clear however I became very concerned about America and he said in kind of mental transformation that is not\nInevitable decline of America is not an inevitable I realize we're being out\nUh it ... the decline of America is not an inevitable I realize we're being outmaneuvered\nMy husband David called berries and novelist who wrote a little gray novel called breaking babble\nAnd we literally followed the plot it was fiction predicting life reality and it was a global billionaire trying to ... us election by funding fake kind of fake ministers\nInto great prominent why to lie the actual faith vote\nSo they realize you know we ... we started doing research and realize that sorrows with funding through open society foundation that Soros dot org twenty five billion dollar foundation now what's funding Jim Wallace Sojourners faith in public life faithful America\nA Catholics for choice Catholics in alliance for the common good\nI mean if you will be on an island is how deep this goes right I Believe that George Soros and Jim Wallace in Sojourners who\nAgain they've taken a ... I mean the Sojourners and evangelical left has taken a sharp left this is not the left of the eighties or the nineties and so they've gotten to people like John Case like people wonder what happened to John Case like that's what happened in various\nYes when listeners begin to think what's happening to my church and why is that suddenly the social justice agenda defined by the left\nFollowed the money that's what we learned it's sad but true uh where you know sort of funding Al Gore and John Kerry for president they lost that was a meeting why do we do we need the faith narrative\nAnd it's a wicked kind of a lens key tactic\nAnd answer it began funding groups like Sojourners to literally teach the last ... cherry pick up the Bible words\nSound like ministers they end up like ministers and he uses busy you know our mall and Americans just they don't understand and so um it's a clever tactic and we just need to just said well why the ... and it's and it's got well needs to learn about it\nLook let me let me say this and this people are gonna think this sounds a ridiculous ... but I don't because I I Know the story and I've done the research\nWhen the church and Germany was infiltrated by the national socialists okay they were very clever they understood that if we can work with people who are biblical he is not illiterate I don't know the Bible particularly well we can sell them whatever we want to sell them\nThe same thing is happening when in America George Soros funded people they throw phrases out there you just said they big grab a Bible verse like oh we're supposed to welcome the alien blah blah blah and people say on that are of course means open borders and I say wait a second\nThat's insane that doesn't mean open borders that means we're supposed to be loving and we're supposed to welcome the alien it doesn't mean we're supposed to change national policy so that no American is safe and we don't know who's coming into our country and we don't know where country begins and ends to make that leap is lunacy but people\nCan be persuaded because they don't really know what the scripture teachers or they don't have a sophisticated\nUnderstanding of how you marry what the Bible says to public policy they just use these catch words like welcome ... simple doesn't the Bible say welcome the audience what George Soros has done and it is really dangerous and if you and if you think that the church cannot be taken over in America and that the government can't be taken over in this way\nI just have to point to the Nineteen thirties long before anybody was talking about death camps of the Holocaust\nThe German church was saying uh hey you know what we can work with um with the national socialist and the national socialist pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed\nUntil the church got infiltrated and that is effectively what has happened to many parts of the American church the but the fact that you've done the research Kelly now people want to find out more about this is there any place they can do is there a Web site\nYes yeah so we go we created some it's American eating and ... with an American evangelicals dot com\nAnd there's a great little Fifteen minute video store its its formula for killing America guide for Americans but then scroll down and you'll see a new three minute video sources rented evangelicals\nAnd it gets into that that it's just three minutes if you share did I go to our Facebook page American Association of shared tear friends it's an amazing I opener\nAnd that our American evangelicals dot com it's

uncovered this stuff and people need to understand this is real they they can look it up they can look into it\nAnd people have an sinking Lee as I just said with regard to you know welcome the alien ... think wait a second you're grabbing one scripture verse\nAnd you're saying that you can beat people over the head and say that we shouldn't have borders and we should change our policies were based on one scriptures that is insanity I mean it's no different than finding a scripture averse to promote slavery I mean you know you you you can't\nYou can't do that you have to try to understand what is the scriptures teach and so of course we are supposed to be welcoming but it doesn't mean that we're supposed to change our national policies in so Soros 'em and Jim Wallace and others have very\nUh cynically in some cases in source case it is totally cynically and Wallace his case ah I I think it might be well meaning lately but ignorant Lee has has twisted the scriptures and people have swallowed it I have many dear friends that have swallowed this stuff\nAnd and they've decided that you know they need to vote for Elizabeth Warren or they need to vote for here he know or they need to vote for for Chuck Schumer whoever is out there that sounds compassionate\nBut in fact their policies are brutal they're not compassionate and they're not doing what they ought to be doing and expressing themselves and loving ways they just they're moves in sheep's clothing so it'd be limping gateway here you're\nRight and we're coming up to a break here I'm so sorry we're going to be right

secularist left these and it's disturbing so I Want to put it in a good word before we continue this conversation some people know that I'm always talking about Hillsdale College in Michigan why because they are doing just the opposite they teach young people or what\nIt means to believe in American style self government and liberty\nOr it teaches kids what is good and beautiful and true that's the whole point of education and they're doing it there but the reason I bring them up is because they're also\nOf education and they're doing it there but the reason I bring them up is because

stuff\nAnd we need to vote and we need to bring our white friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I you know I speak all around the country and and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to save politics is not for me that Christian in politics don't mix that is bad theology is bad it's not biblical if the Bible said that\nI'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people since the beginning of time I'd miss understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed and pulled\nLeft towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how and I I have to say with Kanye West\nUh you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate\nMay be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think we have to think for ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is

Trump was going to nominate and they were against some of the fact that if if you're a member of the placards of the protesters I don't even think the name on it I don't know if they had an ex or what they have\nBut it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president couldn't appoint the ... his choice let alone a conservative\nAnd the chief aim of that battle it's\nRemoved President Trump from office the left\nAnd the chief aim of that battle it's\nRemoved President Trump from office the left and the Democrats and the media\nThat's all the same as I pointed out before never accepted his victory\nAnd they're doing everything possible to undermine that that's pretty obvious so in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump has done during his time in office despite the best efforts of the left\nKnives set for months now I could care less about what he says and much more than what he does and in fact that's I guess it makes me behavior list that's how I feel about people you know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nI think that's what counts now his tweets of not always helped and he's answered people shouldn't that seems obvious to me and engage with people beneath his position to his detriment I don't think he gets that that certain people that's what I Do and I think I'm right I Know people that aren't worth my time well what's the point you're not going to get anywhere anyway\nBut I never expected him to govern in such conservative way in fact I think he said I'm not a conservative I think he said that at some point he's far surpassed my expectations for him\nI must admit he was not my first choice in the primary season I gotta I gotta for the call at full disclosure I was a Ted Cruz delegate and I I was pretty sure he was going to make it at our at least ... a lot of his people told me he was in the show all the numbers of all I guess that didn't work out [noise]\nAnd this is all gotten way out of hand and it was clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest ... or our government at the Justice Department and the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles was my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWhere we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nWriter champagne or celebration I was a big boats the celebration is supposed to happen in New York City\nThere were waiting for her match the only one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all of it would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistance started if not sooner\nThe swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so foreign named in this witch hunt like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't even know he was being under investigation I don't think at the time it's all part of the resistance and it's got it and\nLet me tell ya and I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls what I thought about President Obama we never did what

Virginia yeah you're on with mark\nHijack they mark hey how ya doing real well how you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that what you mentioned about all the good that a hundred and she was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem or recognize and conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nI think a lot of times we can see with the uh the recent interview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values ... Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a course touching a Kavanaugh\nWhat is something that you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her her personal server and breaking that sort of a\nSecurity law in that regard being part of the deep state having someone or something that you see might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight and the and the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle and I'll see her last night we may very well I Hope we don't and people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist that we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on its own and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought what happened like Dana Rohrabacher I mention his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back the house Jake you're gonna see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off and make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have\nAnd we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWe've seen in the past couple of nights some freezing rain and the area of a western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nHas moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those will extend through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael\nNot necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this front but could see a pop up shower or to looking for rain for the mid Atlantic today all the way up into the northeast for New York city and Boston so that leaves a good portion of the country dry today the mid west\nBut northern in central plains to the Rockies Pacific Northwest and west coast all under high pressure and clear skies today\nThere is a look at your national forecast ... radio I meteorologist John trout\nAnd on march ... what he recalls eight six six Ninety\nRed eye [noise]\n... and you know and then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth these people they they're beyond the word despicable wars Hillary puts it a deplorable a you know it it it it's you have to be totally\nBlind or just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts and look up part of this country is falling in eight years we had we had a leader previous presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations\nIn our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years a peak but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden I to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he sent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was black think hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he he ... you're right it's worse now the animosity in this country is is the worst since he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown in Ferguson was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store you push the owner around the store or the Senate in the store not be attended down walked out with a budget goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble that guy was wired for sound so\nIn some of minority it only minority leader\nSays that said it was the way the police officer similar look you're right on all counts and rubber Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country have a friend on radio who said measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president\nAnd at the end of the day as far as the person is so that\nIt didn't take very long for them to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about ... odd Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and al Charlotte and\nIt didn't take them what was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to push to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know the amazing part of it was as they grow\nThat Michael Brown and gone into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gunned that showed him\nYou know you better\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd Pete I Want to have their or they said it triggered a point that I think is very good on your side the left just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we waste two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming there right now although uh it became climate change always from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart\nBut you as you said you got a president now who's not let him get away with this in fact my love what he said the minority community he said what do you have to lose about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win that election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening or will agree\nWith us maybe maybe I Am wrong I've been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them smoke them off the stage\nBasically well and there was this guy has so basic political affiliations he had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people the respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts\nOver the top sometimes you know I Wish he didn't say some things on you know write songs on Twitter that he does and I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I I just listen to a game a partial list and far better than George W. Bush\nAnd in certain ways it can be to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he he's done so much he doesn't get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done\nAnd as I said I don't care what he says I care what he does\nYou know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis what kind of surge in do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition he ideally you want both the guy's been terrific in office and I think he's grown into an even better than I expected\nUm and here's someone else who agrees but I'd go to disagree to mark his in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you mark and um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess\nHe did not needed at all he was already a billionaire he wasn't going to lead us he could have sat out there and and not worried about anything\nShe worried about the people of this country and to go ... in this country was going okay we're going down a socialist path they were going down we are going down\nSo wrong path\nAnd he told us out he grabbed us and told us out and do all left is going crazy\nAnd do a left is going crazy and\nHe is right when he goes to the uh [noise] you know campaign thing [noise]\nWhat he is chalk is absolute truth look I grew up in a democratic [noise]\nHousehold I mean lifelong Democrats [noise] only time my mother she switched was well she voted for next year back in the ... because of the anarchy that's going on and now we've got an orca again [noise]\nAll ... [noise] you know capitalism socialism is good I got kids in college that I agree with socialism\nThat lady hits in college now in the ocean ... good capitalism is bad and we have to change the system [noise] hey we're not a\nRacist country we elected Donald Trump I go to a black church I'm a white man\nYou know and really the Bible teacher after the preacher and his wife and the other you know or or Democrats while they're all Democrats okay wait\nIce wrap it up I got one of the ... go ahead go ahead\nOh I was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we got to go to the break but a ... you know I even love his style ... President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top\nOr as we said you know as a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought the would ever say ... ... he's a character\nBut he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for him to be re elected a new although I shouldn't say that can you imagine their reaction I'm Talking about the left and the resistance\nBecause they're trying to get rid of them are right now that's why the young men of called me at the beginning they are saying well they expect is going to be the worst part the next two years I'll tell you what the worst part is if you guys don't go out there and vote\nAnd the Democrats win the house\nAnd the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be nothing compared to what they do the next two years that's my biggest fear and that's when we got to work on and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine seven three three three nine mark ... filling in on red eye radio\n[noise] ones over for your goals eight six six months he wrote ... radio [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine radio and shoveled sellout making your hardworking journeys more manageable cobra\nElectronics these rabbits aboard the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives from breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radio zone who was making a donation device thinking the fight against the answer is the right to the", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "16"}
