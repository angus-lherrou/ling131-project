thanks for telling people about the dentures I didn't want people to know and I use a very powerful fix the tip of who you can only get it on the black market so my dentures never slip oh and most people assume they're my real teeth because they're discolored but the fact of the matter is\nThere are hundreds of years old now I was going to buy you some ... blue for Christmas and I thought you could you know while you're one of the few people that that know that these are\nAntique dentures that I wear a creepy it's almost like a Halloween thing I'll marry actually Halloween is coming to you know Halloween is complicated because when I first became born again in Nineteen eighty eight\nEveryone I knew who was serious out his Christian faith are believed to Halloween you never celebrate Halloween and I've kind of got more mixed feelings about it now I think what happens is\nA lot of things get hijacked\nAnd then we wrongly\nKind of kicking away like oh it's bad now you know it's like people have this attitude toward rock 'n' roll music or something in really what we ought to do is redeem what has been turned bad but you know when\nWhen we were kids was actually very sweet little kids would dress up as Superman or print Batman and cowboys and stuff like that and and Indians and you'd go out um\nAnd it was very sweet and if you watch for example the peanuts episode of the great pumpkin yes it's so cute it's so sweet now just because\nSick people have hijacked it I mean all Hallows eve okay all Hallows means all saints right how to be hallowed is to be seen did so this was\nA celebration of all of the saints who had gone before that's November for everybody and the night before with the evening or the eve so all Hallows eve all Hallows Eve in Halloween to so many people know that but I just want to make it clear if you don't know that [noise] and so there's\n... who's so many people know that but I just want to make it clear if you don't know that [noise] and so there's really no reason for it to be um\nHow shall I say a\nA a holiday where you celebrate really grizzly bloody violent ghoulish things I mean ... can be cute like Boris Carl off in\nThe original Frankenstein ... or ... or the you know all of those um I never remember the studio oh ... oh I don't remember what was it was All right so you have Bela Lugosi and those kind of thing and there's a kind of\nA lizard genre of that kind of thing which I think is charming which is not demonic but of course\nPeople always hijack things for their own ends or now everybody's dressing up like in really sexy costume so it becomes all about sexy and violent and\nI just want to say here that it it doesn't need to be that way and I think that I mean people who don't celebrate Halloween that's fine with me I'm not exactly a big celebration of it but if you do\nIt can be a wonderful thing but I think we also need we need to know both sides that that you know this is when a lot of\nUm a pagan and drew is in which is actually do\nPray or to the devil isn't that sweet yeah it's so sick\nBut anyway I just I just want to say that speaking of Halloween album and we're having a Donald the caveman Halloween contest but it's really a Halloween slash mid term contest because the deadline is November six is so vague term okay if you dress up as Donald the caveman\nAnd send us a picture okay I mean the costume doesn't have to be like you know Hollywood quality you dress up as Donald the caveman this for boys and girls by the way uh I don't I don't I'm not offended by that kind of cross dressing at a young age if you dress up as Donald caveman\nOr going to send you a sun ... can be signed with my hand my own hand and my right hand now my left and my right hand which is my writing hand we're going to summon assign it to you can send a T we also have a Donald uh he's my caveman sticker\nAnd we'll probably put two of those in because they're very thin and easy to mail and we also have a a a Donald he's my caveman um button button yeah they were going to send that too but I Want to say that uh if you do that\nI think even there of ... yeah well listen I Want to talk to you about Halloween because you're kind of an expert on these things are you and I know we talked about it on the program before that um there is something very real uh the demonic realm\nThat a lot of people discount or they think it's funny or they they get scared but they don't really want to deal with it that they don't they don't know that Jesus has power over the dark forces so they kind of let themselves get intimidated by the dark forces are manipulated whether it's in a real way or just in a slight way um but it's real\nOr even a lot of experiences with the dark stuff we talked about that on this program before so what is your general view of of Halloween because you know a lot of Christians don't celebrate it uh but some are as I was saying can take it more lately a ... and redeem it'd make a cute thing but what what are your views on it\nWell I think the first point is to understand that when Constantine league legalize a church in the beginning of the fourth century a day\nOr stop the persecution that was a good thing\nBut then he brought the Roman empire under his leadership\nTo protect the church and that boomerang because within a couple of generations or the state began to persecute Jews and begins to begin with constantly protected them wanting to protect the church than a boomerang in the process you know he didn't believe in religious liberty he believed in\nI mean this is what this is what Christians or there was some there were there was no credit for like ... what happens is once once the early church lost ... lost the ability to understand religious political economic liberty as Greek thought came in er which is rooted in slavery when you come right down to eat leaders and slavery\nWhen Greek thought came in and do all this and believe in good and evil were polar opposites as opposed to ... being a the some entirety of good\nAnd evil being finite whereas you our ... has emphysema so the infinite good versus a finite evil is the real contrast [noise]\nSo what happens is without a good Hebrew foundation with Constantine he\nWanted to protect the church against\nPersecution freedom from but there was no concept of freedom for ... even though he was also protect the pay cuts and Jews which he did to begin with\nBy employing the church to oversee the council's icy and so forth oversee proper doctor and so forth\nBy the time you get to the ... at the end of the fourth century he turns around and begins to use the power of the state to persecute non Christians and therefore and this is where the baptism I Know I Know you're bringing this back to Frankenstein and directed by go ahead and see what happens is is that when infant baptism comes into the for it's a measure of Roman citizenship\nSo what happens is that to bring in pagan who did not\nA woman citizenship [noise] so what happens is that to bring in pagan who did not want to be converted they had the saints replace the gods and goddesses they had Mary replace the queen of heaven\nWill hang on hang on I ... I Need to translate for that is what you're saying uh and and and and I know you're going to bring this back to Halloween but when I hear that what you're saying is that when\nA Constantine effectively made the Roman empire were not effectively he made the Roman empire old fish ally Christian yes\nSomehow when you when you don't have any concept of religious liberty the power of the state gets much together with the power of the church suddenly\nThe church gets watered down and really opens itself up to all kinds of pagan influences and so what you're saying is that the pantheon of pagan gods somehow gets much together with scenes and seeing so the saints become more than what they're supposed to be the kind of become like the eighties\nBecause it's replacing some symptom face in order to win allegiance to the church of the Roman church if they didn't call themselves a universal tricks about time that was later but the Roman church OK\nI and under the bishop of Rome so yes they did that and so to fast forward a very much for Halloween that's what Halloween as a result of\nSo you have the pagan calendar and the painting counter has certain holidays throughout the year the social services are and the equinox is that also ah in ... terms of modern paganism or you have a January first a Groundhog Day May Day and Halloween\nAnd so in each of these four dates a added to the fore hum a solar lunar dates or you have um\nA focus of energy for their religious rights and practices\nNow what's amazing to me it was religious rights and purr Higgins pagan once okay so they love to celebrate a you know the lowest point of the winter and of course Christmas was brought into that even though a the birth of Jesus was not during the winter\nAnd Easter from asked her a you know taking got us was brought in a set of Passover weeks all these things were compromising language and they can portray more to the ... calendar now I don't know I Do know the ... counters very ancient when it comes to celebrating the equinox is and this also says\nI in terms of the rest of the days of the air or that's more recent though I don't know the exact time table but I Do know that for centuries now Halloween has been a pagan holiday uh and it's it's meant to so it but it's a reaction to\nThe Anglican counter and the Roman Catholic calendar of all saints day which is November first and all souls day which was November second so these two dates are celebrating so all Hallows eve and the eat before all saints day so all Hallows eve at a certain point became a pagan festival and perhaps the most famous one right now well\nI guess uh you didn't answer my question since we're friends I could I could say that you didn't answer my question my question is I mean look first of all I think\nPeople get very hide bound and ... really ideological on things like they say Christmas is a pagan holiday and we shouldn't celebrate Christmas and you think hey folks\nLife is short do we really want to die on that hill can't we celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas does it matter if some people aren't Christians and they celebrate Christmas why do we get so hung up on now and I would say the same to some extent of Halloween\nI I Would I Would agree with you in terms of that attitude or because I celebrate Christmas okay uh and um that's mighty bigger via ... well\nI always have and they are and and you know Easter even if doesn't land on the Passover a week the way it should in the eastern orthodox church keeps to ... to that however\nWhat I was aiming at was you said my experience okay so this historical backdrop I'm Amazed in my life how many of my experiences in God's presence and demonic assault comport with um the ... calendar\nAnd so uh when I had this most incredible and counter face to face with site in the Nineteen Seventy two it probably was mayday or within a day or two so it's one of those pagan holidays\nWhen I saw the living God has a fourteen year old them prep school ... school western Connecticut it was on all saints day November first Nineteen sixty seven or remember that\nBecause in prep school we had skipped night the night before we had to ... ... and if you didn't cited you got turned the water they well they didn't trust in the water but there's too much cutting honest but I remember the day after that okay was when I made a prayer to an unknown God and then the next day\nIs when he showed up supernatural which happened to be all saints day and all souls day so for my very own conversion\n... what I'm Sorry I didn't know this when I asked this question is a very interests what what what happens is that this is my life is important in more ways than I can imagine with knowing\nEx post facto or after the fact looking at certain things that were consistent with paying counters in terms of demonic attacks and then my very I'm a ... conversion what was at the height of it I wasn't aware of\nAll of that being said can you answer my question my original question this is good backdrop but I'm getting back on you now\nIf somebody says to you hey ah what do you think following I celebrate Halloween should I not celebrate Halloween I was saying that I have very mixed feelings about it I I I think it can be a sweet thing I remember when I was a kid it was a sweet thing you dress up as Charlie Chaplin where Superman or whatever\nAnd you go around and you get candy there's nothing wrong with that now people often take these things in dark directions but we need to have the whole thing over to them and say therefore I won't do it I it seems to me that we can redeem it to some extent\nDo you know the apostle Paul opinion on that [noise]\nI probably do but tell me [laughter]\nReceive everything given by God as good and you can celebrate any day that week you want to you know see the ... best Corinthians Corinthian software that one day when Romans um uh is uh I well I'm not\nSure okay as a matter of as a matter but one point I think\nIs what he's talking about is in the a pagan city of current\nThe only butchers you had for your meat with those who first dedicated the animals to pagan gods and goddesses and therefore some Christians on the basis of a weak conscience said no I Will not participate in that because that means that participating in what Paul called the demons and he says demons are nothing\nEverything got as a maid is good if you receive it from God is good so receive the beef\nEven if a pagan butcher a dedicated to um some pagan deity right received because gods the ones who made it demons or nothing right so that's what you're aiming at you're aiming at the power the light to displace the darkness and so the next question is do we understand\nHow the darkness has a hold of our culture say through Halloween where to participate where not to so for example uh my class schedules normally on Wednesday nights\nI forgive you were just going to a break folks will be right back with more John rank and [noise]\nThat would happen to my\nLove among some a\nTailspin last time that we heard about what Janice has to say about ...

see these things and given us the background you said and I want to get this you said that the Hebrew understanding of the serpent and the guard\nDown the Hebrew to Jewish because the difference what's the difference the Jewish choose to do to either exile after Babylon overweight so you're talking about ... so so modern Jewish scholarship the way they look back okay on on the Bible is you don't consider this biblical [noise]\nTheir opinion no see ... ... what happens is the church will take host genesis materials and interpret it back in the genesis which is okay\nBut I really believe that all of genesis one and two and three stands on its own terms you don't have to go to search elsewhere to find out what's happening hokey but ... so I don't know why you would bring up Jewish view go I'll tell you why they don't believe the ... is the devil right just within the circle is an animal and once you do that\nYou see how it goes in crazy directions\nSo if that's a case where is the

[laughter] from everybody in the room and you ... yeah and they they talked to this guy from Austin, Texas Tim aged twenty seven ... who has never voted before okay\nBecause of that Nineteen fifty two congressional ruling there is a great chance but the Supreme Court would just say\n... as the Supreme Court has done before we're not going to get to the interpretation of it like it took\nOr what it took close to two hundred and was a right to two hundred and Thirty years before they ever said that the second amendment was an individual right two hundred and Thirty years but the Supreme Court to finally get to that point if you get don't get to the exact right case and write it in the exact same with the right way\nSo Congress has so many just for the Supreme Court has forced to look at it they may just come back and said nope you don't have jurisdiction there right end up story\nAnd so you never actually get to whether the you know get to deciding what the original intent was like they did in Heller mhm for the for the second amendment mhm and that's the problem\nSo in all likelihood we won't see it changed in my lifetime because of that\nGreat I Wish we would because the original intent had nothing to do with illegal immigrants and and that and and children of illegal immigrants in this country that I ever did for eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nFor six weeks on radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles have been registered to join the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com red eye radio and our sponsors deport your safety on the highway\nEveryone eventually sees the trucks carrying signs grocery store shelves\nGoods to help the community\nProducts they keep the business running\nWhat they don't see is what the\nTrucker carries inside you're driving your history\nWhat we do we see\nWe see you carry a career that help support families communities we see you carry the title of friend and neighbor parents provider we see you carry the sacrifice and the more severe and smell the jobs\nEach was a determination to get such\nWhat you carry inside he's more valuable than an\nBecause it's what's inside\nAttention owner operators I'm tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for some of the drivers or two dollars per mine for teams are asked me Pete he's all miles that hadn't back\nHome or not in their vocabulary there are no treatment rentals needed some secrets are asking the today at an innate RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three six five four apply online at R.

eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWhere some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band or showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nThe Atlantic seaboard including the mid Atlantic and northeast will remain dry today but showers expected by tomorrow and into friday look for mountain snow and the southern and Northern Rockies California and the desert southwest will be dry\nThere is a look at your mid week National Weather forecast from red eye radio I'm meteorologist John trout thanks\nSo much John eight six six Ninety red eye\nOr the Supreme Court has never decided otherwise now the problem is though as\nA let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the left in Ninety eight ruling in may Wong Kim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were illegal immigrants meaning that the court did that they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address\nActually the status of children born to parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not a a\nCase where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAs he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this is read all go back to Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point to the Eighteen ... of the United states versus long Kim arc but that case merely helping a child born on us all the parents who are lawful permanent legally dominance out residents was a citizen even though they said in it\nThey expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with that and and by the way I'm I'm from the and and I I Know you are to uh uh I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with\nYou know after reconstruction and you don't have to end the civil rights act of Eighteen sixties over right right where you knew that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes\nThat that's what that's what it was all about because the parents of those children being born the children being born slaves the the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction now that the problem is because\nI\nAs I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live but [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty years more All right let's throw out a figure\nThirty years I'm you know I I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this\nUh but the problem is the Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act they added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say\nA children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will look at that saying we'll since at that time\nThey didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpret it that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent to wasn't opinion are based there that the court might just refuse to hear it\nRight\nAnd send it back down to and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean a venture early we will get a bench leak someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it the hell are two thousand eight\nBecause the two thousand eight thousand five\nTo does not I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years it it ... it took ... to finally had the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment that it was an individual right\nSo\nAh two thousand at a time flies so\nThat that's the problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but those are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law\n\nWhich uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction as you would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do it as a construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say it differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it but will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually here's and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question and again I just I don't see it in the next\nThirty years I'll throw that out for example\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling\n... yeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president does you know going to take action near\nThrough executive order then you're going to see it in the courts the question is will the high court take a case like this\nAnd and so when you look at the question yesterday where I struggled when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question because the president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody\nChallenges can do it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of in a two ... illegal immigration in general\nThe the care of in a two ... illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong or whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach\nMaybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if that's the cause they know full well it's going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the uh the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly\nOr by just the announcement of it between now and and uh well six days where do the mid term but beyond that it is also something that I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it\nIt brings up the discussion but I think it gets us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will position the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm\nSo that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of it the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick\n... this isn't going to happen\nOr it the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be a mediate block from the courts and then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to go\nAnd I don't go to sleep but ever get right and this is something that\nI ... I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like to travel ban right that affected people immediately right\nSo it would just not jailing with with like what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that it was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but\nIt is not something that is going to be fast track because it it just it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the hospitals on the board\nI Know that growing up on the board I Know exactly what their burden with\nAnd but this is something that that likely is not going to be fast track eight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book for red or radio with Rick early Uri McNamara [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shovel tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shell world tell us what matters is inside\nWhat does it mean to the corner office well\nThe seat in the wheel of the new free ... and the prestige of the corner office takes on a whole new meaning", "show_name": "Dennis Prager Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "31"}
