could talk to you about something more fun but you know what if we're talking about something it's important it's even more important than just having fun so let's get into it there is so much going on in our country we need wisdom what are we to make of the current situation what are you what do you have to say\nWell apart from being a gas and\nAppalled and horrified Eric I Can't say that I'm particularly\nIf you take a step back from the immediacy of the Kavanaugh debacle uh at the hands of the Democrats if you try to look at this from a thirty thousand foot vantage point\nIt all makes complete sense because the Democrats look ... the left has been at war with the constitution the country free market economics individual liberty\nFrom essentially vary from the beginning of the republic but certainly over the last century or so the progressive movement has sought to in the words of President Obama fundamentally transform the nation\nAnd what a bummer meant by that is what the ... the left means by that more broadly which is change the United states away from the foundational principles that made a great\nIndividual liberty economic freedom strong national security rule of law move the country away from those pillars and toured a collective state ... state socialist economics a command and control from Washington and so on [noise]\nThey have been on a war to affected that change for decades now\nSo they have they have met with resistance by the American people who are essentially a center right people throughout this entire war that they've been waging so because they haven't been able to achieve a lot of those goals by the ballot box\nBecause the American people see it for what it is and rejected they have used the courts particularly the Supreme Court but the court said all level to impose their ideas and their agenda because they couldn't do it legislatively\nSo when you take a step back and you look at the confirmation fights over Clarence Thomas for example Robert Bork were they were successful and torpedo going back and it and see for that nomination right now with Kavanaugh who will replace the swing vote Anthony Kennedy\nIt makes complete sense that the left would take this approach\nTo destroy the man his career his reputation his good name his family\nThe battle against those who would restrict your religious freedom unfortunately

I was very sympathetic to what she was saying and I thought this sweet woman she seems so fragile and so broken and she's trying to get this information out\nAnd when it was all over the holes in this began to to come to me I wasn't thinking of it while she was on the stand while she's giving this testimony but I began to think about\nAll of the strange stuff like\nShe doesn't know how she got there she doesn't know how she got home nobody knows what House it was and then there's not a single person who was there who can remember which doesn't make any sense because I remember high school parties and then you just remember stuff like that nobody remembers that in fact all of them are clear that they don't remember it\nAnd then to me the weirdest thing was her she had this little girl voice like her whole demeanor seemed very very fragile\nAnd I thought how can someone I mean of course a sane person says okay I got to be sympathetic this person has gone through something but then\nYou think how can anybody believe her when there is nothing forthcoming beyond this testimony it's just somebody says some stuff and we say isn't that sad we have to believe her of course we don't have to believe or we need evidence\nThat's right and that's called due process that's coal rule of law but the Democrats in their wider war\nAnd due process so it's cold rule of law but the Democrats and their water war for the future of the country gets thrown out these bedrock serve our constitutional or legal and judicial system without a care\nBecause of course their ideological motives and goals Trump everything else including the constitution and including the rule of law suits woman he or she may or may not have been through something traumatic\nAt some point I mean I feel for anybody who has gone through trauma I think most of us over the course of our life experiences of trauma in one way or or the other\nSo I I feel for anybody's pain but the idea that she can't put the pieces of the puzzle together in a college here in a way that can be corroborated ought to a rule that day here now the FBI is\nTalking to people and so on and we shall see but I found it remarkable that the Democrats and and I've got a piece coming tomorrow column in the hill talking exactly about that the Democrats like camel inherits Cory Booker ... with their performance anger\nA world without a shred of evidence but they were engaged in indulging in in performance anger meanwhile judge Kavanaugh who I Believe has been unjustly accused of my goodness drew lugging an and guy intoxicating women said that they could be gang raped\nOkay I mean he came out with the incredibly righteous anger being unjustly accused and they mocked him for it and then they bought but not that to say he did not have judicial temperament to sit on the Supreme\nCourt is that whole area ... right\nWell listen uh what what I find the funniest speaking as a as a as a white man of a certain age whenever somebody talks about white male anger I get angry 'cause I think to myself this is not white male anger my wife who is not a male and my many friends who are women\nWho are black women candidates Owen has been public this is about right and wrong ... so when people talk about white male anger\nThey prove that they cannot see past their bias ease with regard to sex\nOr color they are obsessed with race they're obsessed with sex most normal Americans are not most Americans don't do that if you have a son a brother\nA father a grandfather and uncle you think\nAbout those people and but these women are are are so unhinged and the men that that are adopting this point of view they cannot see pastors so it's never about right or wrong it's never about facts are lies it's always about what's the color of your skin are you a man or woman and and I just have to say when you when you have to go there so to speak\nYou've already lost I mean when these people have to do that\nI think to myself that I I really do believe most Americans see through this that's my that's my face\nAnd yeah and it gets to my earlier point about how they they really do have to destroy Kavanaugh block him the way they tried with Clarence Thomas and so on because\nThey cannot achieve their goals at the ballot box this country is still a center right the left his ideas of socialism collective isn't state and some are roundly rejected by the vast majority of the American people so they relied on the court to slam into place their agenda\nOn and in in what you're talking about identity politics\nThey got to slice and dice the American public by race gender ethnicity or and so on because that's the only way they even have a chance to win it through the courts\nAnd it's by dividing and conquering us\nThat's the only way that they have any hope show that's what they continue to do it is fundamentally anti American you know our slogan on every penny ... soon them out of many one right well they throw it out and to reverse out of one of many right\nBecause that's the only only hope that they have to get their agenda to change the country\nIt's it's I mean I have to say that uh it was very very heartening uh to see someone who I don't think of as particularly a conservative Lindsey Graham\nAh finally say I've had enough I think that there are people like that who don't fear speaking emotionally there there are many who who do and I I think that they have been so careful that they've allowed this to happen they allow people like Dianne Feinstein and Cory Booker and\nKamala Harris and others to take advantage of their graciousness you know 'cause they act like well the Senate as a club and we have to you know when you realize that\nSome of the people in that room they don't really believe in anything you just said it before you're referring to Ted Kennedy I mean the idea Ted Kennedy was a swine he was a swine Nash man threw out his life often extremely drunk\nTouching women having all kinds of I mean just such a mess he\nWas a Senate tore for decades and he was lying eyes by the left when he passed and I think to myself\nThis is the this is vintage double standard and I unless you talk about it but people forget people forget that you have people like that\nThat we're we're the lion eyes by the leftist chant below yeah women in\nMy column tomorrow in that held talks exactly about the Kennedy example in particular but remember it dives like Kennedy and Bill Clinton because they were on this so called the right side of the issues\nIncluding most importantly the abortion issue they were protected and on top of that the the the extra layer of protection of the press\nThat something that Brett Kavanaugh does not have he has on that quote unquote wrong side of the issues most importantly abortion and she does not have the protection of the press\nSo he was being destroyed well guys like Bill Clinton credibly accused of rape and Ted Kennedy literally killed a woman went on to to be celebrated and continue to be revered\nWell we're living in very very strange times of the bill Clinton stuff is probably the strangest them all this man was accused by when he'd have Broderick very clearly clearly\nA did something horrific probably raped her we don't hear about it from the other side folks when we come back we're going to continue our conversation with Monica Crowley look for her column in the hill tomorrow this their taxes are going to taxes talk\nDot com why because well many reasons you get a free

media bias is something that has to be mentioned again today the New York times has\nA you know above the fold an article it says Democrats perked by limits placed on FBI's inquiry in other words they they have to kind of lead\nWith that or it's not\nThat they're ... I mean maybe the principle here is that no matter what you do they will complain so finally\nThe GOP says okay we'll have FBI inquiry now they're complaining about that it it's at at some point it's kind of like a parent where the kid keeps putting excuses about I Can't go to bed now because I got what about this what about the ways that you know what you better go to bed or you're going to get it\nI kind of feel like the G O P needs to be it's like no matter what you do the other side snipes and snipes and winds and what about this and what about any think wow they really don't care about anything except winning I mean it's kind of obvious [noise]\nWell yeah and ... you know I mean no never does anything big like this\nWithout having everything pre scripted in advance I Would not be at all surprised gets over the course of this week when the FBI is doing an investigation no less ginned up more accusers more accusations\nDemand for further investigation and more delay it they they are at war I mean they're just playing three dimensional chat said All right it's like oh gentleman's rules from the Eighteen eighties right now\nWe're planning on two different playing field here\nThe other side is waging war and our side just thinks well if we give them this it will will show or good will will demonstrate good right it doesn't work that way and so on our side get it I think like the Ted Cruz is that the world I think even Lindsey Graham is now has awoken to this\nGuy's like Jeff Flake who are completely consumed with their hatred of Donald Trump are allowing to all of this to get in the way he was on sixty minutes last night with a Democrat Chris Coons oh we forged this bipartisan compromise to allow the FBI to look at this for a week\nDo you think the last ... think Coons do you think Feinstein and and the far left that they look at this as oh this was so great a bipartisan compromise this is just yet another delay tactic they want to push this past November and vote\nTo see if they'll have more leverage to stop this seat from ever being filled until the twenty twenty election right\nI mean that that's obvious and that's the question is do people on the ... is there anybody there\nWho gets it I Wonder what the president's role has been if he's had a role behind the scenes or if he feels that he has to be very careful but I the president has always gotten this stuff he's somebody who is you know kind of a warrior at hard sometimes to a fault but I really do think that Americans\nWho are inclined toward traditional values toward a\nUm toward voting a more conservatively I think a lot of them the reason they voted for Trump and the reason they're probably upset with the Senate now is because of this I think what is wrong with these people are playing Patty cake with the devil Dianne Feinstein is so\nCynical her legacy will be how she cynically played this this is at the end of her career so ugly it's so negatively political it's depressing\nYou know over the weekend irregardless watching MSNBC a little bit CNN a little bit the bill Maher show on HBO a little bit\nAnd I literally had to turn it off because I felt literal nauseous because these people are so cruel and there are so vicious and they're so ruthless and the pathological liar it's not\nThat there's anything wrong with that because we know we know that we're not going to judge\nThat ... the ease with which they will mock and disregard and tear apart a good and decent man like Brett Kavanaugh over politics over their war for the future of the country the vicious and cruelty that I saw I literally had to turn it off and get away from that because\nI felt it on his spiritual level and you live talked about this we've talked about our our beliefs and and our faith then Jesus and everything I look at these battles\nNot just on that the sort of a natural level and the political level and so on obviously it is but I also see a spiritual level to this is a spiritual warfare this is good versus evil and it's so clear to I think you and me and and maybe not to some others\nBut the weapons that are used to are so outrageous and inhumane\nThat I think most of the American people even if they don't see sort of a spiritual dimension to this I think they feel it and see it on some level\nHey I'm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them ... to ...

and uh and this came from a National Review a column and National Review or they're talking about lives Swisher one of the cabinet as former classmates who\nAre over the weekend a went on CNN and was interviewed by Chris Cuomo and was asked the question what do you know about Brett Kavanaugh that he was not truthful about in the hearing Cuomo asked here's a quote I\nWould have stayed on the sidelines if he had said I drank to access in high school I drink to excess in college I did some stupid things but I never sexually assaulted anyone end quote and then she said but to lie under oath to lie about that what else is true\n[laughter] that's it right here National Review\nBut what's your comment about what she believes capital ought to have said in order to be truthful lines up almost exactly with what happened I didn't say during his testimony I quit I drank beer with my friends\nSometimes I had too many beers sometimes others did I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of black out and I never sexually assaulted anybody\nAs well and and he pointed out you know sometimes I went to sleep which by the way is what nearly one hundred percent of people do after a night of drinking I I\nBut it's just you know and and you know look at I was we said yesterday that the story started falling apart for them because of meeting we after they got the FBI investigation than boom\nA if they started with the all the you know ... everything else and it was his drinking what did those words really mean in his uh you know a ... year book what did the slang

what what Republican\nMet okay what made you wipe Republican men need to be castrated and I don't know I don't\nI don't know ... regardless I think that may be going a little overboard\nYeah\nI I Want to take some time to to look into this [laughter] uh if the president could have the FBI look into this\n[laughter] all of the white males [laughter] and it was said and get it done within a week by the way didn't Democrats used to love the FBI yeah yeah\nI remember when you were criticizing the FBI you were undermining the integrity of our republic thank you Mollie Hemingway for a really great tweet on Monday recover electronics user forecast\nRange from what was hurricane Rosa will affect Southern California portions of south western Arizona and the central Rockies through at least tomorrow as much as three to six inches isolated amounts of ten inches of rain\nFor areas are right up through the central Rockies you're going to expect some heavy rain again today alone areas or vi

Midwest is moving off to the east we saw those heavy showers in Iowa portions of Wisconsin northern Illinois\nAnd Michigan today that system slowly moves to the north and east we'll see rain for I eighty one all the way over the eyes Seventy five\nAnd then on I eighty east and west we'll see those showers rather heavy today\nYour national forecast from red eye radio\nWest we'll see those showers rather heavy today your national forecast wrote a radio a meteorologist John traveling so much John ... and oh and also the new trade deals look good and bad\nAnd they know it has that been someone claiming that about Obama and two thousand eight that it never would have sold now today well ... well you know it's coming out now is the leaks that completely anonymous\nYeah right there was another one uh ... completely a ... a an anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh there's another lettering from somebody else have you paid attention to social media\nBut you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often I mean it's just\nAnd and it's to me it it shows you know that NBC don't ever\nEver complain about President Trump using the term fake news now and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of peace trash story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in\nThat this person is walking back everything\nThat they say and you can't find anybody to cooperate it you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from my it was we talked about yesterday from Eric Brady at USA Today and when he\nWrote will should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source by the way just the un out as I said on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know that it's important see that's what you're doing your blood people know that [noise] 'cause somebody might find out and and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in in touch over the years just on Facebook\nA which is a space whose Facebook balance delete it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claimed it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh\nIt's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it hit home with me\nThey are never going to\nGet off the brand care no no ever this it and it won't end when Trump is no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls them out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating it they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nA story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now hit it metro had reported that mine finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court\nThat would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news\nIs that an all time low\nThat's it\nNobody believes you and I see right through you\n\nYour tax nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior now ... stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right\nYou're not even worthy of his recognition frankly\nBecause you're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't\nBackup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process from the prosecutor gets zero time\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level right that'll really take 'em off\nWell that that's in and that's what it's that's ... and that by the way coming from a guy who ... who has how many times that\nSat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account away for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively were he said something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House had been horrible but that's how bad and the NBC but it's all you don't\nHurt you shut it you have an earned the right as him because it's also what you get from the left that well because of this presidents and there were changing the way that we do thing yeah we haven't no\nWe haven't shall we don't care who looks like we have communication\nWe do thing yeah we have it no we haven't show we don't care less active communication we we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton back at what whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and if the two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do when do they\nGo out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody that they themselves as a news organization can't backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and ask that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr forge claims and would you say the same thing the memo did not even that\nThey completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals jumping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to think what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here we're well it's interesting\nBecause one of the one of the other stories that came out\nDuring the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that the fear that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left and as the founder of the network\nAnd then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN think that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump resistance\nBut we know that we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know bear before\nThat can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's they're not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a ... they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis\nThat's a new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see why your hand analysis\nShould be here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion\nSo if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what the cat's already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC it's at the bottom of the network news\nIt's not Trump it's you yep eight six six Ninety read I\nWas really much about and recorded radio [noise]\n\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to
