for listeners to this program its taxes for Hillsdale dot com Hillsdale they when they educate the student they held their college they don't take a penny of federal funds right which is a wild concept but they're like almost no colleges are able to do that down and down and so they are genuinely free\nTo teach about American style self government and liberty they they teach about American exceptionalism they teach their kids with the constitution means all the stuff that not only is not being taught in many college\nThe two she means all this stuff that\nNot only is not being taught in many colleges today in most colleges I'm afraid to say but it's actively being taught against Hillsdale their champions in this there's very few very few colleges um that uh that understand these issues and teaches who choose to their students but the reason we have a website set up my taxes for Hillsdale dot com is that they want\nTo teach the things to the whole world right they want a everybody who's able to go to that website to access what they are giving their students so the same professors\nTeach college courses that are available online for free these are the actual Hillsdale professors wearing the actual clothes that they were in the classroom that's not a joke\nSo if you're going to taxes but he'll feel dot com you can find that out such good stuff their their their\nTheir champions and I just had to say that All right so now we've got to talk about the contest\nMhm see mine no no please do this was something that you needed to share with ... no I think the caveman contest is terrific\nOkay wait here's the thing that in order to get a signed copy of Donald drained the swamp we're going to make five available so this is only for the first five people who do this a more people can do it but they can enter the contest but only five ... automotive first five people\nWho dress up whether for Halloween or for all saints eve or whatever you want to call it

getting really excited because\nA man sharp we've had him on the program before\nA ... I wanted to get him on again but this time with his client a man who is now\nA effectively famous in the world of religious liberty jak Philips a the owner of masterpiece cake shop in Colorado I have them both on the line thrilled to have you both on the line gentlemen welcome to the program\nHow folk I'm Glad to be here they travel is\nYeah I I got to say a ... thanks to both of you met your there too right yes I Am yeah well listen uh ... this program I Am I my audience knows that we're doing a a a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom because you guys do everything you do for free and everything is at stake but I'm really excited\nTo have both of you on but there's a lot of times you know somebody like you jak seal up your name your out there people don't understand you were real guy just like everybody else you're a small business owner you were a normal person I have met you and you know we forget\nThat what is happening in America it to people who have basic biblical values is crazy it's absolutely crazy it's happening to folks like you in fact\nTo you and so I Want to talk about uh the Supreme Court victory and I want to talk about the more reach into trouble or is that uh that we've had so maybe I'm jak you could just describe if you would uh what happened way back when when this couple came into your\nInto your shop and asked you to bake a cake to create something not just to sell a cake but to create something for a same sex wedding ceremony\nStarted or six years go down to two thousand twelve Thursday Afternoon to German Bakery in me to create a cake for their shapes actually\nI don't ... same sex weddings they were surprised to hear anything else in the shop other historic cookies brownies just ...\nThey got bad for you know they stole my store so that the country [noise]\nWell okay so we have to be clear because I always want to educate my my audience so we understand these things if somebody goes into a hardware store and says I Want to buy hammer\nAnd the person who was a hardware store says using gay I don't want to tell you that hammer get outta my store I hate gays or maybe use as an even more ... term for gays\nEvery body in America would agree that is not okay if you ever\nEvery body in America would agree that is not okay\nIf you have a store and you're selling cameras you got us all hammers to everybody it's none of your business ... what they are what are you know but we're not talking about that we're not talking about\nA lunch counters refusing to serve a hamburger or to black customers we're not talking about that we are talking about somebody coming to you and saying I Want you to ... I Want you to use your to stick skills\nTo help us celebrate something that we think is really beautiful and should be celebrated and at that point you say well\nThis is complicated because you're not asking me to sell you a sheet cake for birthday you're asking me to create something and to enter into a celebration of something that because of my faith that can't celebrate now let's be clear you don't celebrate Halloween you know there's a lot of things that you as a Christian you say\nI don't agree with this and you're living out your faith in your cake shop\n[noise] that's true yeah this is October we turn down dozens of cakes to celebrate Halloween because Christian faith I don't believe that somebody can do\nTo celebrate the same sex wedding I Believe vital teaches just betrays to celebrate something other than that goes ... core of faith and they said I'd be glad to sell them\nCookies brownies anything else or make other customs ... birthdays graduation so it's just a quick fix that go against the teachings of like\nOkay so they wanted to sue you they did to you and Matt Sharp what happens at that point\nWell unfortunately or as we might expect actually the civil rights commission and and all the way through the Colorado court system they ruled against jak ah they found that despite the fact that Jack serves everyone in and even this couple Harry gladly would have served him [noise] ah you know off the shelf items cookies cupcakes but\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation\nAnd so we took it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court and we're glad to see in a a strong decision a seven to decision that the court said Colorado you are demonstrating hostility towards ... elite\nUm how you been forced is what you said about his believes all show that he wasn't getting a fair shake and and the state was targeting him because of his beliefs about marriage and that is in permissible under our constitution\nWell it's an amazing thing first of all I think it needs to be set against all Americans need to understand that we're living in crazy times I mean somebody might just say you know one jak I got to be honest I totally disagree with you I think you're wrong\nIt's another thing to say you're illegal what you're doing is a crime in you're going to pay and we're going to sue you and you're going to pay and then to have the state agree and say yeah you have no right to have this point of view because I I just want to be perfectly clear\nPeople listening because ... you don't need to agree with me or with Jack you know what I Do agree with us\nIt's one thing to say I disagree it's another thing to say I disagree so strongly I think you are doing something criminal\nAnd you need to pay through the nose you need to suffer for this this is not OK and the state says yeah we agree this is criminal\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just be honest not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views\nI mean look people like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy\nBut you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their view is whether you think it's crazy or you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only do we like the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up when it's great lawyers and say we're going to have to go to court\nAnd this goes all the way to the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was argued December yeah go ahead go ahead Jack [noise] you know you go ahead and nobody I Know in December the ... of December the ... okay I\nThink that was Seventeen so almost a year ago to Washington DC so the court Ruth ginsburg Gorsuch Roberts all of them\nAnd it was a failure to let's be clear with the seven to two decision seven to two\nOkay now this is a big thing I Want to say that again are we in America need to understand and this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justice and said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices\nAgreed the Jack was wronged\nYou still have to fight these legal battles it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost a match sharp\nIn legal bills if alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cage shop says uh okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved\nBecause you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and I'd say I'm best part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jacket hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding Idaho person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand that\nThis most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff to shut you down because they think you're a big it as I Want to say folks\nWe need you to help we have a matching goal if you go to my website ... attacks us talk dot com right now click on the banner we need you to help this is important we

to a to match sharp as with the wind defending freedom and so you guys are facing yet another battle that somebody has come to you and said okay you're not done we're gonna make you fight again we want you to make a transition\nCake which almost sounds like a joke like it sounds like is this real the transition cake I when I heard that I thought this is just um it just ...\nI'm sort of playing head games it's like a ... let's see if we can get Jack Philips to make a transition cake or and now you have to go back to court effectively don't you\nYesterday ... freedom is right back to help us again\nWe're allies for freedom is right back to help us again in the short says what are the best lawyers I Know [laughter] so that juries are going to be working with is hopefully we'll get to straighten up this time [noise] for a\nWhile now ... where do you see this going I mean uh what is the next step who ... with the first battle\nYeah so it's kind of two two phases one we've got to that same civil rights commission that the Supreme Court ruled against it is\nDemanding a hearing on this um and so I think it's it's ... scheduled sometime in February but we're working with jak we are going on the off chance on this and so we've actually filed a lawsuit against the the civil rights commission and the state\nAs simply trying to put a stop to this that enough is enough jak has already been in the six years we've got a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThat state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of this is asking the federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating a shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is kicked design\nYou how much baking you getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court and it's kind of nuts\nYeah not enough food to yeah it's still busy\nRight [noise] um my goodness I just ah [noise] it is that a cat\nNo that's a torch on and so there will be watching the door of soda\nToo and I do have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll ... everybody should read it gosh\nThat's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them\nBut I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know um what it means to be an American and how precious it is and what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberty the rarest thing\nA really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it than most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have a both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people\nFighting um thank you for um\nReferencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you or you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick this as we just said you did not pick this and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom\nWho knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now um but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so that's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased or proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and put an end to all of this\nUm said that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay ... and ... which federal court is it can you say\nYeah so we're in a federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but it's not it will go up to the court of appeals and potentially back to the U.S Supreme Court but we're hoping that\nUh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nGas or when the Supreme Court sent a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't bring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that ruling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law\nWe think that's a strong demonstration of the exact hostility that seven members of the court\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one of them W to

went on vacation because I Know that we had talked about before right so uh we'll get to that coming up here in a little bit I you know there's an ad for Claire McCaskill\nAnd we need to stop the divisiveness\nShe's a Democrat now for people who don't know in Missouri mhm\nUm\nShe's desperate right now yeah so she has a new ad out\nWith two men talking you know how they do that the whole conversation with an ad like like it's really two guys dodging that'll what do you think that in in the ad scripted they actually save is Jimmy at [laughter] she's not one of those crazy

immigrants are well potentially illegal immigrants wanting they aren't illegal immigrants until they actually are illegal in Mexico some of the ... yeah like right illegal illegal immigrants and Mexico I get right yeah you can say that ... a then uh we have the\nA potentially destructive device suspicious packages\n... story and I use those terms because those are the quotes that are actually being used by the FBI right\nAnd and you and I've just been you know I'm of course like everybody else following the story but\nBecause there's a lot there's a lot to the story I mean there's the there's the actual investigation what's actually going on here\nAnd nobody really seems to care about the investigation in fact I wrote down here media screams we must stop this divisiveness as they become make a divisive by blaming one side and the potentially destructive devices story yes how much more divisive can you get we need to have civility papal does\nThis suspicious package and I think it's your ... you don't have the evidence and you don't you have no idea we had no idea what the evidence\nIs about who did this or why they did this I Believe was Andrew McCarthy and National Review that said look I'm I'm not you say you know you're on social media you can look and you can see that\nThere there are people on the right there are saying okay this would be a perfect thing for the left to set up the Trump Administration you said there's no evidence of that and then he goes to the New York times and writes would threaten and says but the New York times is saying you know when you see what they're writing they're basically saying the opposite they're coming out in stating\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking law enforcement you and I remember\nWe shake tapper writing and writing pepper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear mhm they were they kept pushing the narrative\nThat the you know that the police rotted control hands up don't shoot you remember it right they they they were part of of pushing and amplifying the divisiveness that was based on a lie mhm\nSo CNN don't sit up there on your high horse as if we're just the end is worthy innocent Arbor tours of the news\nWell he's just a ... is soccer calling out his own Don Lemon for the other night saying that ah regarding the Ted Cruz and so then that that comes with the territory that in in a private setting on private property it's OK unacceptable\nTo be shouted out

I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me who was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well and that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not\nPart of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do and this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across\nAnd if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not thoroughly now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get the\nMessage out there but there is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time where we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nThat we don't know why that's never been the goal to convince\nEverybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population that people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the ... one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and upset you know I used to think this way and then I started all you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them and listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base ... never be satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you've sought out shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he used a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people writers you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me ... if you'd like to but just\nWhat you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really a calm [laughter] it's always a very old high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table isn't oh it's like sitting on a beach\nIt's like that just sitting there and say I I got friends in St Thomas sending their Virgin Islands St Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and\nAnd so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree but then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil no that's not our goal\nLook after them on the issues go after them was with a you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric is it doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mass of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation ... they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand that on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely related to that it gets ...\nAnd under the side that I'm most closely related to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack\nBack\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that\nThey work well well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand four\nOr to him becoming president and two thousand eight\nOn hope and change to just the other night and Nevada bill ... who well I'm a well almost big was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what\nI Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater Brock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and votes they're going to win the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay Kenny can you\nCan I ask her about it and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issue is that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate could still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand that people have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day from what you saw was the shell of the Democrat Party which is the\nOther night which is no ideas just imagery and symbolism yes well except for free stuff yeah yeah the ... are
