welcome to help flying on your host pat Campbell and we are sponsored by the find folks at the surety products\nOne of my favorite gas is on the line we've got Chris kill him also known as the medicine hunter standing by now CNN calls Chris the Indiana Jones of natural medicine because he's constantly scouring the globe searching for natural remedies\nYou may have seen criticizing the doctor on a show or maybe on PBS or CBS and also on Fox News where he does a health segment he's been featured in New York Times and\nAlso on ABC's twenty twenty anti Bush is joining us today to discuss not one but three of the hottest nutritional ingredients out there on the market today even better he's teamed up with purity today\nTo give away a complementary bottle to everyone out there in the listening audience so do not I repeat do not change that dial\nFirst a quick introduction Christian ... is an author and an educator he's written fourteen books he's conducted research over thirty countries again he's been on with Oprah and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much that it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with us\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it can be daunting\nYou know with all the different supplements that they're not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin and some fish oil maybe a few other things go into the three super hot nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell I'm happy to do that pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated these in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza there a trial I've worked with scientists\nIn Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field and meet with the top scientists and my conclusion is that\nGreen tea ... came in from Tim recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health financing agents that\nEverybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea human different spiritual why did you want a combined three there's always a method to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you call it a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to\nPut them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derives so it's kind of like you can make a salad\nIf you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidants so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial in\nOne product with truly meaningful amounts of each one not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging\nBut what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood glucose ion you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nWhat you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nBut don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nBeneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood and concentration of antioxidants so what happens is you get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating\nAround in the body and protecting the cells of your body organs\nEvery part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are that right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to thigh on\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue the thigh on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do\nBut it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula really offering free brought on a few minutes but talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know it's one of the most\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea helps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar\nAnd unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increase the weight\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract when you've got the right extract but the sciences there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with purity\nFormula it provides you with about three cups with green tea in each to Capitol serving obese cutting edge liquids off Joe so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alertness in just too soft gel caps plus you get the ... human and the ... too so it's easy you call it\nYour daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cut and explain some of the top benefits as well\nWell I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest\nSuperstar protective health enhancing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that you can get in a capsule\nAnd a good liquid the soft gelatin capsule or otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the medicine and are now in this new green T. C. R. formula for purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain health\nWell I especially like\nThe liver protective heart protective and joint modifying\nProperties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact blood and studies show that newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants\nIn their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nWe might not think about our livers that much but we need that and and we know that curriculum and protect the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nFrom a joint standpoint we have in numerous bolt studies showing overall improvement in joined health\nAnd relief and stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind\nAnd Kirk human delivers all this so I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body\nSo I regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat enough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated curriculum and extract\n[noise] I don't want to remind people didn't call now to get started with a free bottle of green tea CPR for purity products this is their unique green tea formula would see Kirk human and the ... each of free bottled today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five right back to the show 'cause I don't want to get to technical here but these anti accidents and green tea or classified as police females and they really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists\nBut in this green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea it's got the ... the written very thoroughly we talked about\nClass grape seed extract pine bark bio fibroids vitamin C can you talk to me about this array of really super anti accidents and poli sci fi knows that you put in the formula\n[noise] well yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract in pine bark extract\nBoth contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity\nBut also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there is there a troll the bio flab annoyed\nAnd hence the overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take and so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nIf we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realize that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great\nThis formula the Greenpeace ER will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I Love this green T. C. R. combination formula and remember this ER stands for human ... spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners can get started for free that's great value what what people expect to pay if they bought all of these separately in the store\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty\nSo they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend on the green tea see our formula and they still wouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the ... the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results can people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking this formula\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy\nBecause these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control\nI think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body when you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see are limited history to provide you bought three cups worth of green tea and each to cancel serving plus you get the anti accident equivalent of several servings of fruits and vegetables plus\nYou get the ... of several servings of red wine and the joint comfort in brain function benefits of the curriculum and I mean while the only one formula in the last two minutes talk to me about this short cut to better health and why you want everyone listening to this program to call now from that complimentary bottle green tea see are\nOkay fortunately\nThere's and the man's body of science that has been growing steadily for the past Twenty years and it's really rich science now we know that of the various plant derived substances that exist green tea extract ... extract and ... extract are at the absolute\nTop of the list of protective\nVitality and ... overall health promoting compounds there just isn't anything like these there in the green tea CRC our standing for ... product in meaningful amounts people will take this product it will be\nRapidly broken down in the system very well absorbed they're going to feel the difference you're going to feel energy you're going to feel more vitality or just plain going to feel better kind of more fluid and in that flow of good health so I Want people to experience that and\nGiven that they can get a free bottle I'm also not saying that put yourself at great risk and spend a lot of money and say no try it free let the product speak for itself\nChristian them as always fascinated information we appreciate your insight thanks so much\nThank you pat it's always a pleasure to speak with you\nThere's an incredible free bottle offered today on purity amazing new green tea CPR super formula here's the deal purity products right now be one of the first thousand polish today just pay for Ninety five for shipping which is one hundred percent refundable if you're gonna rush you any complimentary bottle of green T.
