that both of them Secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised that would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trading bloc in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are\nThat are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who had to pay my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to American stays in America [noise]\nThe there is a a sunset

it's an extremely important to Graham it\nBetter than than anything in the states as everybody goes she had it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune but in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers\nIt's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is\nThe the the President Trump trade 'em um type and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nFor talking above Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement I bought one of the things that were wondering is how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing with is there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this and Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly there there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that uh\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ... in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or they think it doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticism you have which is sort of an odd and one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should have talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together\nAnd then they draw that conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan\nFor working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being\nPurely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican both if that's what we had to go she hated that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and is not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood from CNBC said specifically regarding auto slipped listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry in those provisions work\nMeans our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nSchool I guess my I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all the ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford F. ca wishes to cry sir Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all set is going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've also that's workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take him to sit down and blue sitting there belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they do that what they're talking about this was going to be\nReally very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe get the idea and by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to the biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content [noise]\nAbout cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest off we're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who's going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy\nThe people to talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America\nThat could be candidate also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nWell I think what President Trump promised honest on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bob Lighthizer USC are what's next I mean are you guys gonna get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland and some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they and the Swiss are anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\nYeah and that we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise] we have a lot of things that we're doing a small deals dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through 'em but there's a bunch of other countries and then of course\nDon't even know about we're talking I won't go through 'em but there's a bunch of other cuts you do it and then of course the big the big elephant in the room just China and one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the\nWall Street journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things just sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S and the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced his three Israel one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like\nWhat it is what are the things you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire that the ... the opposite it and then the other ones that you should look at it I ask any of your your list there to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January twenty second march eighth but July and August twentieth yeah\nYeah I just looked at the points but but at the bottom just show where the where the the the China actions are the markets like straight up from their\nRight I mean is hilarious right as well\nI'm Glad today that I I Know without prompting what the three of one means like how many how many people know that other than you ... ...\nWhat I can and careful I should be careful I I used we we all sort of jargon and the short\nAnd whatnot I mean if if we have\nA statute that allows us to take it as the president to take action when somebody does something that's unfair or

see we'll see what happens but uh the end of the day that's all that really matters but there's gotta be a little bit of this NAFTA waves still running yet maybe not but I Would think that it's still

but you didn't I didn't let you panic and you might not have listened and panicked anyway but you didn't panic so you stayed in that was very good\nAnd ah your head you did because you begin to do enough sense in general sure you have not everything has been gone up since but in general you've done very well so that's good news um\nRight now as we look at what is going on in the markets are again the downs up over a hundred points but that's only a third just over a third of one percent but still very good European stocks\nOr continue to be under pressure now they closed in about twenty minutes and they continue to be under pressure\nNow there's a a new thing on Greek fiscal worries so Greek or Italy is where all the pressures coming from but now they're starting to be some concern

the austerity Saturday measures but now they're out of whack again\nSo investors are beginning to get worried about what's going to happen and what the future's going to look like a they're also concerned this would be the euro zone also concerned about global trade issues now we aren't as concerned about global trade issues as they are because they have more to lose China should be very worried but they're not worried at all they don't\nCare\nBut European Union as we start to see stocks coming under pressure as a result of Italy and Greece fiscal worries one would think that as as they get to that added to the concerns about trade policies one would think\nOne would think\nThat they would start saying you know what let's sit down let's get this trade delegation uh up to speed let's get to America let's sit down with the administration's trade delegation\nAnd let time or out a really strong trade agreement\nAnd they all to do that I Know that we have continued to talk about

treated these which has passed away so I'm looking for who can help me buy and sell church bond says is there that that doesn't seem to be a popular out and what the stockbrokers so\n[noise] yeah well it's that's because none of 'em are publicly traded um there are all you know there are all privately listed most of them are privately listed [noise]\nUm there are great great stories about church bones and there are some horror stories about terrorism [laughter] so um they you know um\n[noise] it is there is a a a big group out of Atlanta I don't know where you got a ... you know where your church bonds originated from ...\nUm but there's a big group out of Atlanta that is a [noise] you know it does how does a lot of church bond issues you know in other words they they work with the church to um to develop the bond to get it issued and then\nYou know putting it putting out there but\nUh I'm not a big fan of church bonds because may you know I'm I'm all for financing the church but when I've had churches big churches call me in and and I've talked to me about that I always try to discourage them from doing that and the reason why I Try to discourage them is\nUm I think it's important that the church family truly take ownership of of the church\nAnd I think the church bonds oftentimes or a way that we get ahead of God you know we'll we'll get the money will go ahead and build and pray that God will raise up\nThe money to pay the bond often pay down and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that in in you know in and of itself but I I Love the good old traditional way of raising up the money the day that you need from the church body\nThat should be you know more than willing to do that\nAnd and building as that money comes in so I'm not been a fan for all of the whole of philosophy of doing\nOtherwise I'd have a you know two million square foot studio maybe I don't know [laughter] by uh you know world were raising money for a studio but if all the money doesn't come in um\nYou know bull stop so it does I mean you know it's just so I'm not going to get in that that that kind of debt but you know all in all I think a lot of them it has a proven to be very good and a great source of\nFinancing for for churches I just don't like for lack of accountability what's that\nCuts at all amount of performed very well and and they they are you disagreed up and then when it when I matured they paid them back so I mean it's just\nI've got one left and I just I just need to get rid of it because it's so small now that by itself is not really helping\nMe yeah and the only way you can do that is you've got to go back to the person you got it from ... who passed away this past year why that's why you did see that [noise] um but you know where it originated do you know is that there's got to be a company where do you get a check from you know where you get a check from\nRight yes yes I can walk and be able to them\nSo you can go to them and ask them if I'm telling you want to sell it back and often times they will especially if a small and they'll take it back um and that would be that the best way to do\n[laughter] well that sounds good I'm Glad it's your time\nAll right thank you Tony I appreciate the call thank you God Bless you thank you\nUh let me go to Mark Mark is calling on during that time yeah let me go to mark in Virginia a mark\nI'm we're talking about no income\nOff that you're looking at that and I was just trying to understand that if you haven't Raul act look out and\nIs there a strategy you which one do you call from when you're going to need it for 'em and then your other on that you have that are for road\nWhich one would you have that and\nWell if the if you have a raw sucking Utah Nevada Roth account right\nRight or wrong ... attack a little town there on trade and I have a right and if I had a choice\nWhen you first full from that Raul act will count you have this is for calm and and whatever I don't have or whatever you wrote that you promote\nYou know what your foot in the act or how do you plan to order straight\nSo a Ross IRA as not taxable\nThat's why I was um I was a little confused so if it's a ... there are no taxes ever right okay so you um so it's not a it's not a taxable\nAccount when you when you pull money out of our Ross you don't pay taxes on ...\nStreet plan which one would you put your\nIncome producing products versus non come produce a product so he's always fly off the odd I at least tax is possible and um and for it to 'em\nOn that that you're not using it for income\nYeah so my my goal would be as you draw down money\nIs do you draw it first out of the deferred camps only because I'd want to try to get rid of that like in other words I don't want to get the last I don't want my state to get left with my wife and I go down in a plane I don't\nTo get left with my wife and I go down in a plane I don't want my kids to get my traditional IRAs or deferred accounts I Want him to get the ...\nSo I Want to preserve if I'm going to preserve money\nIf I'm not going to draw I Would rather draw it out of the ... the thing that is going to send me a ten Ninety nine that I'm going to have to pay taxes on I Would rather pay the tax\nNow and work on getting that money either outs or moved over to the Roth account\nSo that a vast you only the only thing I have a laugh is a Roth account\nAnd then of course all of my income producing anything that I have\nIs gonna be in that Roth account so that as is producing ... income and I take that in income I'm never going to be taxed on\nOkay so basically I don't think but\nI Need a thousand dollars to live off of and I'm getting ... percent I'm going to have that you earn versus if I was from the wrong or that will count Rob ... you know\nWhat would be no long term Fifteen Percent but instead of doing that like starting it go ahead and bite the bullet start the taxes on the act or that your attitude\nThat's yeah I Would ... unless you don't care about your errors getting whacked with taxes\nSo on I mean if you're trying to save taxes in general\nYou know I view it I mean it is so your heirs are going to get if you believe them and the IRA account traditional deferred stuff and if it's deferred and it's not an IRA could even be worse\nYou know they're going to get you know twenty thirty percent probably more than that\nThan they're going to end up with if they end up with the Roth IRA okay\nSo it really depends some people I Know people that say okay you know I'm not let my kids were about my kids I'm not worried about him um or or my airs or whatever it is I don't care maybe your heirs are going to be charity in which case I'd be taking all my money out of their off because charities\nNot gonna ever pay any tax on that\nTradition I mean it really depends I mean I you know a\n... every circumstance is different I'm making the assumption\nThat some day you're you're all of your money's someday are going to go to somebody else other than a spouse that doesn't count but are going to go to somebody I'm making that assumption is that the case I Would want to give them\nMore ... than I Would give them traditional or deferred otherwise\nAnd also I Want to everyone else out there\n[noise] this information to be able to get this information and the the cost of eighty for the for the hundred and twenty five right invaluable honest coughing guys would\nAnd convictions to be responsible you briefly told us at one of our band Branson retreats but I Need to

has done what he is done in in in my life\nOn all that God has done what he is done in in in my life and to\nMe of all people so it's obviously very moving um\nTo me even yet so because of the emotion of it I never did it for years and finally a many many years ago I was doing a town hall meeting I'm probably twelve years ago or so maybe more in Rogers, Arkansas\nAnd it was a huge town hall meeting we probably had I don't know um Fifteen hundred people there maybe maybe more\nAnd I stay you know I stayed I was there for late into the night we were I mean we were there to probably eleven o'clock at night long after everybody left and there were still a group of about two hundred people and we all pulled came in together we sat around and they were asking me questions and I was answering them and we were talking we're having great fellowship with a lot of fun\nAnd a a a woman a young lady uh asked me about my testimony\nAnd I so I went in and gave her gave that group that small through my testimony\n[noise] when I was down there were people very moved and crying and I said to our the lady that asked me the question I said are you okay you know I'm you know it's I'm I'm good this is all good you know and I was probably emotional giving\nAnd she said to me I'm so sad\nThat all those other people didn't ear\nAnd I was just it was like I'm life going through my heart because I knew 'em I felt like God had had placed her there to say that at that time\nTo\nRemind me of the lessons from scripture [noise] so ever since then I've made an attempt to when I speak\nPublicly in the in the setting that would allow it to give some testimony I never get my whole I have so many my testimony is good news is ... is more than one event but I give some of my testimony because I think it's so important um ever since that\nSo I'm just because of her that I now give testimony but I I I've been a you know I haven't uh I don't do it often and I don't do it as often as I should\nI came to the lord late life as I said there and I don't go ... you know I went to Branson upright went into my life up prior to\nUm my testimony which I don't always do but at a very low point in my life I was one of those people that pulled off the side of the road and prayed to accept Christ listening to Charles Stanley it we're speaking directly to me that was right after I heard another man who had a life very similar to mine gave his testimony\nAnd then getting a car and I hear Charles Stanley and that man was Ben Carson and this was in the early eighties nobody knew he was\nA back then and um so uh it it is an interesting testimony\nGrateful because when I heard Charles family as well as I Know when he was coming towards the end of some ...
