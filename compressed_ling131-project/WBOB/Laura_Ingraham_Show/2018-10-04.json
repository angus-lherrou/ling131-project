tweeted publicly about how many people were interviewed\nIn the Gulf Kavanaugh's previous background investigations but majority will permit the public disclosure of the number of people interviewed by the FBI for the supplemental background about nine were in ...

I think they're just they don't know what to do at this point they saw\nI think they're just ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out\nI mean they say the stall ... I think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they've been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's why I really believe\nOr let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful lengthy Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left [laughter]\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing our job is pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this shouldn't be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is ... and the others were sent to Washington to do and we're all waiting ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame that say okay we don't do that when it first\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think that when people tweet around things like look a man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] you know or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps an artistic kid and they and the seven eleven or the other video of helping him stock things you know it's nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things around people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to know that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no I have well\nSadly like there's so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your ... and Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room [noise]\nPeople who are applauding us he's walking down the halls and hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six Kavanaugh FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of that really she thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out\nMiss characterize what's in these FBI findings\nSo it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scott ... the\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually how profound you're through all the political saturation of ... you know the back and forth\nAre profoundly positive the exposure of the last quarter there I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to the need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll do literally\nAnything to get there and what's happened in this capital earring is literally from what I you know for I'm Seventy three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time\nTo witness that you know that they have their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I got plenty of Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything that they're lobbying if this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very obvious\nYeah that was the ah that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos where we should have calm where they want to rebel routes and intimidate\nInstead of show results intimidation over ideas that's where it is I think about it it's intimidation\nTactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports\nIntimidation\nOver information and insight ... intimidate this is all they're the biggest bullies in\nTown they're intolerant other of other people's views well they claim to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that you're anti immigrant\nWhen all they do is talk about white privilege racist in your they're obsessed with race we want people to be treated the same\nThe rule of law should treat all people the same doesn't matter what color of your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Lara glass half full I Believe that's coming up next a former assistant FBI\nOr a staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n\n\nThe ... that are real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need help ... trinity of one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something to talk to a certified comes from where\nThey were able to take all of my different payment input then altogether\nTrinity will consolidate during accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payments put a stop to late fees and over limit charges and reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you saved thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors and being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nUm and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out\nBottom line is how many and if you have to do are\nAs many takes the latest pass the election watch\nIt outside their cards so the the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this weekend by\nSaying to his should should not be any more delays you do the best you can do\nAnd the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative\nTo to allegedly offer and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college or law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what would your response to that they\nDo they know that if they ever read on how they know what's in the supplemental they they don't know what questions are asked was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with\nOcean yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to continue that the alleged doubt\nSo contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the\nWomen up down here that Bill Bill or a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that ah the FBI prove that you knew or testimonies from former classmates of Kevin ... these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo would the FBI prove those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and bottom line is first of all it's coming from Ronan\nA secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses to that and they're not permitted on the stand in a court of law\nNever mind are doing this and you have to make that cut off someplace into what is you know calm and what does make sense to do and none of these people make sense ... anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't carry any weight with anybody ...\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happen Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense are and that's not happening I think the problem that exist share of the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out that the the the Democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all Trump Trump fans from the bureau\nIf it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know look I was going to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that\nWas demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and you you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting\nIn a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no with no corroborating contemporary be contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... brought us this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what the role of the FBI us\nBut you see the ignorance it's the willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be sacred this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is these some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on it's wrong it's because they support they have to say well I Believe that uh the the judge Kavanaugh was guilty and you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion\nBut they do\nHave him here on the ...

this guy's life on the basis of two people who testified who I think are fair if there is no cooperation and that's certified by the FBI\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the geo pay a new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree uh and they were\nMade some joke about Tina Fey hum who took white women to task after the Trump election who helped him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nFaith focused her remarks on college educated white women\nForty four percent home of whom voted for Trump\nSaying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support among Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nWell I think that is the the biggest\nBut both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory point for the Democrat so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women\nWho voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for uh for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis Kavanaugh nomination never help that I always thought that a woman nominated who even women nominees for what might have been more conservative ... would actually have been for the right strategic choice here\nI think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those\nIssues that Trump is focused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see uh LA Times\nPoll counted twenty for ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women eight twenty eight percent advantage\nAmong married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this is a substantial block\nOr the married college educated women that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans so that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen who has the right we point out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message ... every day every day that the the national question is is she\nRapists or not\nThere's a day that do but he's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers ... come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why and Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans and come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states than show\nAgain the races are tightening even fake that perhaps Donald Trump busy data that shows that this is driving conservative the conservative voting base back home of course he didn't do plays exactly to Donald Trump strength\nThe one thing he is an expert in is resentment specifically in this case white male or as a\nWhite male resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men though to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics on mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far and\nAs you do\nA for a long time I I've been against both class warfare and the density politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize they were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing\nHas awakened the Republican base you know in in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately\nUh I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading and and now I think you can see it kind of a balance among turn out here because the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again ... you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who\nAre are dragging their feet on the on the nomination or the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nBut see that's ironic thing that I could really see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate race has tightened up because\nThe Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice load and if you're in a state that voted forty points for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see confirmatory in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and didn't leave there's no leadership\nSo much you know Ryan quit his job and didn't leave there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or you say has stepped up maybe some people think we're leaving some people you know I think too harshly but as you said you stepped up he's got a message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I have to read or less\n... less than that at the Paul Ryan should have left if he's going to retire should have left to let this thing can be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh this politics of her age that we're seeing right now I think the people that Trump was\nEmbodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote for some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in this basic principle of fairness and would as mark said if you really shy away from my identity politics\nA political correctness used as a cudgel to silence people you've got to vote get a get out

ago um I feel I feel good about it\nA singer is saying that Dana parks that money in the twenty\nUm has been as drops in her interest rates will cause that ah that fun to drop a little bit and has\nA should I Move it into a CD I we always Sandra it really depends on what you're going to do with it and what you're thinking about with it um [noise] you know if it's long term money um I don't know that I Would be too awfully concerned about it trying to place it um\nYou know in the CDs but at the same time if you do that and um for the next couple of years you're probably going to get a little bit of a better return\nI don't know that I can say that over two years but I Will say over the next six months of the next two years even eight months you're probably going to get a little bit of a better return so I don't have a problem with that look this is this is treated pretty much as cash\nI'm perfectly fine my number one first priority option for any kind of cash is a CD [noise]\nThe reason that particular mutual fund is on my list as I have ... as I've said in the description of that particular stock that it's really there for tracking more than it is anything else not it's not a by is there for tracking\nIt's an air so that you can use it\nAs a way to track your cash because their share of value remains at one dollar so if you have cash in a CD or at least you can put it in your tracker if you are prime partner and you're using the tracker uh that's the main reason\nFor being there but you you know it's fine there's nothing wrong with there's nothing wrong with owning his ability responsible I'm but\nI'm I'm a I'm OK either way and I don't think it's a bad idea to move to CDs I don't want you to take a loss on it that's the only problem I'd rather wait it out if you if you have a loss or you've just seen the payout go down a little bit let me go to Tim Timothy and Michigan hate Timothy\nHello Yes sir\nI'm twenty three years old man a man I've been at all what you read and buy all our\nThat's our ...\nOur costs and rhino problem of course then Bobby Beth what type of investment would you prefer to looking to to ...\n[noise] I guess uh I I Would I Would want you I'm Timothy to think about probably some good solid\nYou know our stock of some good solid technologies technology company ... so I mean I Would look at now if you're looking if if you've got a little bit of money\nThat you can set aside for the long term something that you can you're saying to yourself man I all I Know is when um whatever fifty own at you know I Want my money to be growing and I'm going to have you know I'm going to be getting sick for retirement so and so forth\nI mean that's how you have to look at it is really really hard\nOr your first of all you you want to open an account of Robin Hood\nRobin Hood is a great place to get started because it doesn't cost you anything so you can buy ... shares of stock you can buy five hundred shares of stock and it's not going to cost you anything\nNo no no fees and it's a great place to start but let me let me tell you something Timothy and I I I'm I'm really sincere about\nThis if you if a twenty three year old person if you're twenty three and you said yourself you know what every payday I got a little extra money I got you know um I got fifty dollars a month you know extra\nAnd I would just like to put that fifty dollars away in something that I can just forget about it not even pay attention to\nAnd you picked a stock up um you know what any stock\nA stock up um you know what any sockeye technology stock a in a dusty trio stock whatever any kind of stuff you pick a big company though big company stock\nAnd every month you joke and you bought whatever five fifty dollars you're gonna buy of that company so say bye to share you buy to share and you do that every month\nFor between now and the time you retire every month once a year to share five years ten chairs or whatever it is you do that every month man you have more money when you retire and you know what to do I'm I'm Sears you're gonna have more money you know what to do it and you don't but the key is not getting too excited\nWhen it goes down who cares keep buying when it goes up yeah that's good it's up I'm not going to get real excited by it\nAnd you just do that on a regular basis it's a ... ... people that I Know that I've met over the years that are fifty five sixty years old this started working for a company a big company and every week they pay they bought one or two shares of their stock out of their pay\nAnd you look at him I said the firemen and they don't even realize it and here they got a million and a half dollar sitting in there I mean it's like it's it's that's what it's equivalent to and it's a great great thing to be thinking about\nNow you know but but you can't if you look at a stock market and you're thinking man I Want to make some money quick or the ... and being quick I mean in the next couple of years I just want to\nPut some money or make some money quick you may you may do it you may do it but\nIt's really hard to do it's really hard to do you might just lose it all too I mean it could go either way so I Would say stick with a good solid company and just every every month just plug away little by little\nAnd put a little bit of money in it and stay disciplined to doing it every month I mean it's got to be like putting gas in your car man every month you're you're you're buying a couple of shares of this company and I'm telling you it'll it'll pay huge huge dividends to you as you as you get older\nOkay okay right right right\nSo give it a shot go to Robin Hood on on your phone you go to a phone app to have a phone out Robin Hood to ever have a computer out and all that and I just get an account open I don't think it costs you didn't get in an open and then you start start getting some money in there and and invest in it\nOkay I Will do this or I Will do it\nAll right thank you Timothy I appreciate it brother I'm Glad you called me thank you God Bless let me go to Marty Marty calling us from Tennessee hey Margie\nGood morning damn good morning I'm\nApologize first off or if you've already over any of\nMy eyes are it happens all the time 'cause we don't get to see where we really miss you don't you know be to be [laughter] oh yeah but anyway uh\nMy first question is we have our first and bond since February pretty seriously about ten percent at times and with interest rates rising\nThey anticipate do you think that the ... of those prefer junk bonds will ever come back\nOh well I Can't speak to the bonds I don't know what kind of bond you have or whether it's a bond fund or an individual but the preferred to going to come back because they're going to get called\nAt some point in time okay so if you have a preferred and you pay twenty five dollars for it and it's down to ten dollars\nIt's going to get cold and you're gonna get your twenty five dollars okay you so if you but if you bought a preferred thinking you're going to try to get some gross yeah then that's a mistake by ... because you got to be doing it for the income\nRight and are you getting the incumbent or you're saving the income or spend any income if you are when you're using it yeah and that's all that matters\nBecause it because if that goes to five dollars a share it's irrelevant from an income perspective you're still going to get the income and the full amount of money that you invest it is still working for you to produce that income\nAnd and so you know you understand that when it gets called someday is you know it's going to get hold of twenty five dollars if it never gets called for a minute for the income I don't [noise] you know I had one Thirteen
