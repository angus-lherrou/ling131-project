and make no money [noise] so Thursday was a ... it was an ugly ugly day\nIf you woke up and you heard the news on Thursday morning news was that morning while I was the news about\nIt was on Thursday morning news was that morning\nI was the news about rising bond\nYields yields\nAnd the news that China is implanting he Chinese buying chips and all of the government's computers and phones the eyes of the defense department's computers the Navy's computers all of the computers that we buy from China have a chip him\nAccording to the Bloomberg Businessweek article you\nWould not have been surprised then on Thursday morning to see the market fall all\nDay I've been warning you all that I thought inflation could get out of control could get ugly ugly\nMore on that later in the show though I've been talking with you about the\nChina trade war and about two or three weeks ago I warn you that the war had been downgraded downgraded to a skirmish astonished and then it was likely to be downgraded even further to us back to his fat\nBecause the president said he loves China he loves president ... there'll be there'd be a mess\n\nBut on Thursday we find out that China's putting computer chips spy chips are in every electronic device will use at home and then the government the government uses presumably to I don't know launch nuclear weapons I don't know to start a war\nI don't know\nEvery every every computer that the government's got got got secret Chinese chips in them\nChinese chips not and so so let's get to that story\nAnd and the and the story of according to Sean Hannity is a good men and women\nOf the FBI you know how Sean I says well I'm not talking about the bad men and women of the FBI like Jim call me\nWith the store King Day every day working guy at the FBI the good guys are really good guy they really do a good job\nAnd yet Hillary is still an indicted I understand the story [noise] I don't understand what makes them so good but maybe I'm wrong\nHere's a China spy chip story from Bloomberg Businessweek and this story this story could have your ... stock market implications\nAnd twenty Fifteen Amazon Amazon began quietly evaluating startup company called elemental technologies of potential acquisition to help with a major expansion\nOf their of their streaming service streaming video service that we know today as Amazon Prime video\nElemental technology had help stream the Olympic Games on line and it helped communicate with the international space station and had ... and if funneled drone footage from the various wars to the CIA\n\nElemental national security contracts weren't the main reason for the proposed acquisition but they fit nicely with Amazon ... business such as a highly secure cloud that Amazon Web services is planning to sell\nTo the to the CIA how many of you know that the CIA was going to host top secret information on the same crowd that you host pictures of your dog\nI knew that because I pay attention\nTo help with due diligence Amazon Web services which was overseeing the prospect of acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nThe first pass uncovered troubling issues prompting Amazon Web services to take a closer look at elemental main product the expense of servers that customers installed in their networks to handle video compression\nThey serve or who are assembled for elemental by super micro computer not my own company supercomputer super micro computer uh San jose based company commonly known as super micro\nIt's also one of the world's biggest supplier of mother boards mother boards are the big board and Saudi or computer that upon which sits all the other junk\nRight\nIn late spring of twenty Fifteen elemental elemental staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario now this is good right so elemental is going to send samples servers to Ontario so that some\nCompany in Ontario can determine if those servers that are going to the CIA are safe\nSo we're now we're now we're now outsourcing national security to the milk sucking Canadians but one cell a milk until this week it powdered milk to be accurate\nThat so I don't know why we're out sourcing our our our national security to some company\nAnd Canada hoarding milk\nNo stood on the servers mother boards the testers found a tiny microchip not much bigger than a grain of rice that wasn't supposed to be part of the boards original design now the first thing I think all you people at home should know\nAbout the CIA and the fear Federal Bureau of idiots and the so called good men and women who can't even find a cause to indict Hillary is that in the business of examining computer parts right like if you're intel\nOr your apply materials or kale like ten corps or your um lamb research\nWhen they inspect the computer chip Darren Darren ... acting the way for that the that the chip is ultimately etched on\nYou pick the day you pick a time\nI'll send you an email on a map with directions to the office it's closest to you and that's all you have to do a little while later\nYou're going to receive an invitation to register for the amazing Gemini private client portal involved as well as some basic on boarding questions that kind of need government kind of like you to answer so I can make sure you're a real person that kinda thing and then you just sit back and wait for the meeting just start\nSo I'm Peter Navarro Peter Navarro\nWants to tell you that our being held hostage to Chinese steel is the most important thing in the world we have to have our own national sources Steele\n\nI Would tell you we need to have our own national source of semiconductor production of computer production of electronics manufacturing so now it's your choice\nChoose me or choose Peter that moron Navarro\nBecause I Would argue to you we can always get steal from China we've got plenty of steel we can make in the United states\nBut well we don't have in this country is a reliable workforce that can manufacture high tech electronics and semi conductors we don't have a reliable source or we don't have a reliable logistics chain\nFor those items\nSo it's up to you to decide you can go after steel which is I don't know what thousands of years old or you can go after high tech electronics you tell me which one of those two jobs using pays the most\nSo let me see if I understand the story so far the according to Sean Hannity that good men and women over the FBI who still can't find a reason\nTo indict Hillary or Christine bubbles Ford or that any ... mosque for stock price manipulation they can't find a computer chip\nThe size of an enormous grain of rice\nBut the folks that apple\n\nCan I fear chai comes may have the keys to our nuclear systems are worse to our money the Chinese government didn't directly address questions about the manipulation supply chain safety they say in in cyberspace is an issue of common concern\nChina's a victim\nMeanwhile the FBI and CIA can't find a chip the size of a grain of rice\nOn the mother board of a computer which is the equivalent of you finding a gigantic Goodyear Blimp in your living room I may be wrong\nI digress Mardi please tell me there was a point to this ridiculous story please tell me that you've not may mean listen to this incredibly long over my head boring story to make the point that China is buying on the please Marty telling me there's more to this radio program all there is more\nYeah there is\nThis could be a serious there can be a serious\nRetaliation justifiably\nThat couldn't markets so it will be interesting to see how the president manages to deal with China knowing that they're spying on everything from your your\nAmazon Alexa all the way up to his aircraft carriers\nGot to be honest with you you know I got to be honest with you if this doesn't put price if if if listen if exposing\nThis story is saying that the Chinese hey we know what you did and we know how you did it if that doesn't bring them into the twenty first century where they can agree to cease and desist from this pattern of behavior\nIf this doesn't bring them to a trade negotiation that results in the end of this kind of behavior\n... maybe ...\nMaybe he's dumber than I think or maybe as dumb as I think he is smart president has every right to break China over this this is an existential risk to the United states this is an\nExistential risk to the United states and we don't have a supply chain or a manufacturing center in this country to replace the equipment that come from China and we don't have a room we don't have a reliable partner\nIn Asia that we should be relying on not one computer\nIn the defense department should be made by any company other than a one hundred percent American Company with one hundred percent sourcing in the United states and we're going to put US Steel and the damp pipes that we used to deliver oil or ... or liquid oil from Canada to the United states if that's got to be us type\nThe computers need to be us computers\n\nTwo weeks ago I diagnosed the problem of Ilan mosque of Twitter fame\nYou know him as a CEO of Tesla that overpriced electric car that probably will never succeed because nobody actually needs a self driving crap in it\nAfter I ripped him and his car company again over his comments to the SEC I don't know what was it the beginning of football season what is it now for games in\nAnd so you probably you know as I was floating in the pool with my good buddies jacking Arturo last friday afternoon you're probably\nAnd in the pool with my good buddies jak and Arturo last friday afternoon you're probably laughing at me because you heard over the weekend that he made a deal he made a deal with\nThe SEC and by by the time the markets opened on Monday the shares were not\nDown but they were up forty five dollars boy must you have thought how stupid I was\nOkay but I warned you never trust the Twitter famed yeah the the kind of person that has to tweet out his life\nHis dog is kept picture of his grandkids what's going on in the White House today when he had for breakfast like what's going on a Tesla\nThere's there's something I don't know mentally unstable\nAbout that behavior because frankly I don't want to know Ninety nine percent of your life I I don't want to know any of the things going on in your life\nBut he ... mosque can't help themselves and so this Friday morning before the markets even open\nHe's on another ramp ... but this time twittering against the SEC daring the judge who has to approve the SEC deal with him daring that judge\nOn new that deal and drive him out of the ... have you guys want to invest with a nut job

together starting at nine\nAM consider your pre game gift from me\nSo if the a reason\nThat the stock market's sold off on Thursday\nWas because of the incredible rise in bond yields\nAnd as stocks fall in price as yields rise in price how Marty you might ask the giant brain how is it possible to argue that this is a Goldilocks stock market\nGood question I think I have an answer I think Thursday sell off was Albert Resnick which does not mean that is not going to sell off more just in the form of just because people want to take some profits a lock them up as I just suggest it\nBut I think it was algorithm in which means that their computer potentially one with communist Chinese chips inside of it computers\nTriggered an algorithm that said hey\nThere and these these algorithms sometimes a very very simple but I Know they're very very difficult and and the way above my pay grade\n\nThe computer basically says hey bond yields rise therefore stocks should the value of the evidence stocks value of equity should go down because people like to put their money in a safe place they value safety more than they value growth they value the potential\nTo lose money more than the the potential to to make money that is what it's all about\n...\nBut the algorithms I think are not properly accounting for Donald Trump or the or the amazing Donald Trump economy or the\nGreatest economic green development in the U.S history you have to stop and remember how this recovery has work\nI'm going to be off script again I I Know I could probably gonna be ten more pet you got twenty two minutes left or something or we're going to be off script\nAgain you have to remember what this and it's important in order for you to make money the stock market you have to think about these things and know these things and inherent you yeah I that's why it's so important and I say to you I have CNBC on all day long is because I Am fully immersed in the stock market\nI see things and know things that you can't possibly see or know and I know the nuances of things that you can't possibly see or know because you don't do this all day for a living\nBut if you remember this recovery this recovery started as a consumer base recovery mom and dad got a little more money in their pocket\nThey were able to buy more closer you had a retail recovery they were able to go out to dinner so the dying the restaurant chains went up a little bit Wal Mart went up a little bit of Home Depot open up a little bit you're able to fix your house up a little bit you were may be able to buy a new house\nAnd so that's the consumer led part of the cycle but er but if I'm not mistaken only two quarters ago only two quarters ago six months ago and I am correct\nOnly two quarters you go to Donald Trump corporate tax cuts went into effect so the corporations the businesses are just now beginning their business recovery remember\nApple and Google him and Ford and General Motors and\nWhoever else you ought to Boeing they they have only gotten the benefit of these tax cuts now for two quarters and it took him the first quarter just to figure out what they could couldn't do ... how the tax cut ... what they might be able to do who's what other business list for sale that\nHow the tax cut ... what they might be able to do what other business was for sale that they could buy where where the where was there a piece of land that they could build a new factory\nOn these things don't turn on a dime we're only two quarters and so that Donald Trump corporate tax cuts\nNow have you say that we got all the juice out of that in the first two quarters okay I respectfully disagree with you maybe you know better maybe you got your advice from fidelity I don't know\nSo I think that the algorithms are not\nConsidering factoring in the benefits of this booming economy which is now\nBusiness led not necessarily consumer led\nAnd I get that I mean how many more Ford F. one fifty can you people afford to buy how many more Katie Holmes can you people afford to buy\nAnd so maybe the consumer is finally spit out the other news of Thursday was the headline news that Amazon was raising their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and oh my God\nThat was going to be inflationary that was going to be the cause of inflation that would cause the federal\nReserve to raise rates higher than expected somewhat like Anthony Weiner's I don't know somewhat prematurely you might say but here was the rub\nHere was the rub we've seen this story before and but but the algorithms haven't gotten the message yet we saw this story last year when Wal Mart raise their minimum wage and guess what\nThe ... the market's been straight up ever since then despite the fact that the whole\nAnalysts community said hey raising the prices waving the wages for some cashiers at Wal Mart is going to be inflationary it's going to be in the federal\nDidn't happen did not happen did it\n\nAnd this begs the question how many how many of Amazon workers are actually even pay less than minimum wage how many are actually getting a raise I don't know the answer\nMaybe there was a lot maybe they're maybe most of them were already making minimum wage\nThe concern was well\nIf I Am a zones raising minimum wages now those good guys at McDonald's or going to have to raise and now the guys over at whole foods is gonna have to raise wages and now the guise of politics is gonna raise bugs is going to be a catastrophe\nWhere people are going to be out willy nilly were raising wages way better out we women around the stock market gr I met her cause if we'd better cause the yield on the treasury says rocket higher\nWere better panic the Federal Reserve my normalize interest rates\n\nTo me it was so much water off the ducks back then was then there was the whole utilities things right I'm sure infidelity told fidelity probably explains you then there was the whole utilities thing did any of you know there was this much financial\nNews this week while you were out taking the kids to the zoo Moore yoga or or or soccer or whatever whatever sport\nIt is this week who knew guy on the radio could make money news this much fun\nSo Thursday's drop wasn't just big it was weird right it was weird the Dow Jones industrial dropped two hundred and points the S. and P. five hundred drop twenty four NASDAQ dropped a tumbled one point eight percent\nSo what's strange is that there were only two sectors trading up on the day and they're sectors that don't usually trade up together like Democrats or Republicans I no matter what one says the other does the other right\nTo raise your hands of you know the answer what two sectors were up on Thursday\nRight exactly correct the financial sector and the utility sector we're both up\nLike cats and dogs living together says Barron's utilities and financials moving off usually move in opposite directions but not Thursday\nFinancial benefit when rates are rising city group um J. P. Morgan but they really haven't they really haven't risen Barry they've been lagging sector for most of the year\nAnd utility generally game when ... are falling and that's the opposite of what happened this week\nBecause utilities generally compete with other forms of fixed income\nSo with a ten year treasury saying as big as one day most since the elections has twenty sixteen the moving financials as easily explained and understood\nThe but the but to move up and utilities a bond alternative often bought for their chunky devotee why were they up this week\nSo in treasuries rise it ... it's supposed to make them less attractive right now more attractive but that's not what happened\nThursday it's not what happened\nMaybe you just move out of some of your momentum stocks big tech stocks and maybe go buy some lower value stocks I don't\nKnow there's a new CEO at General Electric I Can't tell you what to do with that stock talk to your own advisor but there is a new CEO at a stock at a company has been decimated\nDecimated\nLine to see this as a buying opportunity an emphasis for asset allocation in rebalancing that'll favor longer years so instead of buying so a lot of you guys said well look I might put a little bit of money down here and these two years the three years he's the short term treasuries\nBecause the rates are so low and by golly where I'm putting them in these because I Want to be able to get out I Want to be able to get out when when rates go higher I Want to be able to get out without any kind of a a ... a decline in my share price will now that time he saying now is saying hey Marty\nWas out there he was looking at his bond his list of bonds that are available on the bonds of six and seven seven and a half percent\nI have to tell you if you're on an annuity and you can buy if you could come into my company and look for bonds that are paying six and a half seven percent versus an annuity you should be in the office on Monday\nUsually there was an annuity them bonds are two different things they both have pros and they both have cons but when it comes to purely generating income greater income than the other\nI got news for you if I could find corporate bonds decent quality corporate bonds yielding seven percent I'd want to be in my office I Want to be first in line on Monday to get into a meeting with me\nDavid out or chief market strategist said inform intelligence says rebalancing will favor laundry of this really looks he says like a technical event and a position squeeze seeking rationale that is more cosmic an existential\nWhat that means stock market could end up paying back in full\nThe some of the Fed's past easing actions he says that's how ... works but Thursday in other words what he's saying is\nLook at some point we can go back and re trace everything that the fed gave us since two thousand and seven and two thousand and eight but it's not today is not going to be the day\n\nWow wow\nI mean there's just this is ... if that doesn't ... if the if if you think this type of inside and understanding\nIs commonplace that that everyone gets this stuff if you heard this from Wells Fargo or fidelity or TDY or your guy or gal and you need to stay right the hell where you are\nBecause you got a great advisor have on the other hand you find value and someone who pays attention who understand these markets were you invest your life's work then maybe you should consider taking a meeting with me in person here's how you can reach out to me personally\nTo reach out to me in

to think about all of this disaster is news I Am I'm certain that apple some day is going to\nGo from two hundred and twenty eight dollars a share down to zero probably go out of business probably a fad\nAnd so as I said here I'm I'm really concerned about apple I I I I don't know what to do with apple I am perplexed I stayed up hours and hours and hours last night thinking about it on my

sure Kevin ... out of a\nWoodley Texas and um this is a [laughter] a name and have you used to not use it before but uh we'll get used to actually so Kevin as we are as we start back up here let's talk about you got the you got the corporate or you got the college education out of the way you've got a job\nNow you're married you you've done the American thing\nWhen that what time did you start to think maybe this is it into\nA probably a pretty early on in my like corporate jobs so I I worked\nFor ah my my first job was in high tech I worked for a summit conductor manufactured probably the only one out here in Dallas so everybody's but I Know what I'm Talking about [noise] but uh that was my first normally jog coming out of college I was there for Eighteen years and I think just going through that whole process I'm\nMaking a little bit of money and just kind of going through corporate America politics in the system and\nUnderstanding what's possible you know I always felt like there was something more I Would just spending just an incredible amount of time doing what I was doing and then travel all the time and you know seven AM meetings to turn around seven PM meeting you know it's just\nYou know burning time at both ends you know and trading a lot of that for four at the time was you know very little money\nAnd I think throughout the whole\nThe whole process you know over the course of those Eighteen years\nI knew there had to be something different I I figured there had to be something that an easier way a better way of of just replaced my income but if I were going to retire\nYou know how am I going to replace that income that I'm not going to be making you know and high tech you know you're lucky to make it by the you know I'm\nFifty five sixty is almost you know out of the question and so um it's not that I felt like my time with limited but I felt like I needed to figure this thing out whatever retirement what's going to be an hour I was going to make that happen\nAnd start early and then start early is what we always talk about what what what we're taught is that you know working say than we did that and we work and we said quite a bit\nYou know with with what we were bringing in [noise] and um\nYou know it was I think always something out there that I just couldn't put my hands on and it wasn't until you know\nReally twice Thirteen um that I that I discovered lifestyles on them and and that was only only because of a friend of mine you know when we're walking and having a quick coffee break down all the way we were talking about\nYou know a real estate investments that they that nature any kind of turned me all too but um you know\nBefore then it was the same thing that everybody else does you know it was or one K. was there is a mutual funds that was the gold in handcuffs and if you're in corporate America out there you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know they latch onto you bought it go and hang cups and when you called stock options and man that that can keep your ... or more years because they give you\nKnow so many shares that will or maybe the maybe you know be above water\nBut um you know at the end of it I was making really good money I had a really well we had a really good life I mean we were making six figures easy you know and uh what we thought was pseudo job security you know without really knowing what was going to happen or when it was going to happen in terms of ... but um\nBut it wasn't until twenty Thirteen that we fell off though and decided to make that job\n[noise] so let's talk about the transition because you know you got to get the good job working [noise] you know when you hear about this what was it that that enticed you wouldn't somewhat exploited to add to this must be a friend or work or whatever [noise] uh what was it that it touched you about this thought process\nFor work or whatever uh what was it to the ties you about this thought process\nAnd I think I realized yeah um I I think I realized pretty quick it was everything that I had been looking for you know the whole idea of real estate I I've read if people you know a millionaire next door then millionaire\nUm there was another one out there but I've read those books and stuff and knew that real estate was was something that that I thought made sense I just didn't have the means the knowledge or the education to figure out how to do it\nWithout putting everything that we had saved at risk and so there was hesitation and the skepticism then and it was you know me talking about these five twenty nine plans for kids you know college savings and and and and their teacher education then you know my buddy was you know carls was telling me about\nYou know investing in in a single family you know properties than he has three kids as well we had a lot on them to a bought three of them and his idea was I bought a house for each kid\nAnd when they're ready to go to college we're just going to sell out all the equity out and build their or college tuition I thought it was incredible thing I've ever heard how the heck did you figure out how to do this and he mentioned you mentioned lifestyle you know and um\nYou know we got into it you know for sure that way you know through Helmand that that little five minute session\nYou know to a major Kevin ... as you sit here\nAs accomplished as you are right now that that simple concept at all he wanted out of a worse you know so many of our members want to be completely retired so many of them want to be millionaires\nHe just wanted a way to fund his kids college that's an amazing thought that it can be a mall is that yet empowering and you thought that was amazing\nAnd now with ... you know promote all you've done you can realize that that was a very tiny step compared to what he could have done so it's it's interesting to hear the story\nFrom that perspective so how did you come to lifestyles originally did you go to a free workshop that you bring you to a case study how'd you how'd you get over here\nIt's his membership civil is he he's he's been with us for quite some time that two thousand nine but he's only bought those few homes and I didn't know about the case studies or anything like that are really anything beyond that Arthur helping a lot to do my research and found that free workshop and that was my\nThat was you know my my in and do a lot of the kind of you know see what this was about and and whether or not we thought it made sense and we went through that a free workshop and in that progress into you know the two day\nAnd um I told my wife I said look at the ...\nI think it was five hundred bucks or something like that at the time and said look it's gonna be the best five hundred bucks we we've ever spent because this was going to completely change our lives or not but it it it's a hundred bucks you know so um\nWe made that small ... that's what it is I mean it was a I mean for for my buddies is by three single family homes for him that was pretty big you know for me it's a five minute conversation which has the potential completely changed my life did and then it says that you know small little step that I had to take to make a a five hundred dollar investment just to figure out\nThe nuts and bolts of this thing of what it's about and you know and understanding a lot more this what I thought was going to be single family you know real estate oh I had no concept of multi family or apartments or any of that nature but it was just the course of these small steps that we took in these small decisions that we made and\nThat that really honestly got us to where we are now you know\n[noise] well you know when you look at this thing you look back\nYou probably sit there and go like it happened so quickly I don't even know how it happened I the older I get the faster time flies by these dates you're thrown at me or not that far behind you is there not that long ago and I know the manual were three or four apartment complexes now many on right now\nWe own well I mean we're uh we're owners than sixteen bills more than three thousand units we we own or manage two of them currently ourselves so we have our own property management company and and we own older managed to those\nSo three thousand units sixteen deals\nAnd that's like a blink of an eye in your life if you think about the lives of your children in the destination of your family that's a blink of an eye to own three thousand new sixteen properties unbelievable\nWill do short break and when we come back I wouldn't have Kevin keep going with the story and explain to us how we got to those extremes numbers and do so we write back and Kevin ... and the ... radio\nShow\nFinances are probably not even on the table for you the more you're probably that point was that many deals that much either you under your belt that you just don't even worry about it\nUm the other one is that\nRetirement is not the end but it's really the beginning you think about what you were able to do right now Kevin with all the time you have to think about a new business to create a new business to go with your family and do stuff let's compare time wise because now before\nLet's compare time wise because now before even if you want to do something and you were to brilliant engineer you couldn't do it you had to get up and go to work now something hit you in the middle of the night you get up tomorrow morning and you attack at like a dog talk about the time difference in being\nYour own man\nI yet again it's it's it's a night and day difference and that that that really is what it's about I mean in in corporate America America you're you're trading all your time\nUh for what seems like good money and and and that's what it is and you know I Would\nI'd be out the door before my girls even woke up before I could get them you know before they even ate breakfast you know headed to work just to avoid the morning ... you know what I mean and catch a catchy seven AM call you know work my twelve fourteen sixteen hour days go back home you know\nMost times you know not even be able to to get some you know before they go back to bed before I'm coming back into the door\nI'm you know catching better or not you know sometimes in some cases only to hop on another phone call at seven PM and [noise] and then that's the circle is is this just Bush's corporate circle that just turns in grinds and\nAnd um it's it can be um\nI I don't know people the people get used to that and uh\nIt's a it's a time the empire I mean I spent a lotta time traveling overseas traveling the world and when I was younger that was great got either world got to see a lot of things but you know with my kids and everything I wanted to be home I wanted to spend the weekends with them instead of being stuck in an airport you know I wanted to be able to wake up in the
