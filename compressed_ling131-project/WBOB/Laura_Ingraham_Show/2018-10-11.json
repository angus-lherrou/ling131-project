the friends the ah the has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks and yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy uh\nBoth assassinated and they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate I think\nI think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through Watergate you had a\nWe had a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point a US soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed of and there was a very bitter very divisive time ah but I think after that\nUh we became sort of more normal for a while\nAnd uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine a cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said it wasn't inaccurate that shot somebody will cause she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin out\nBecause we want to return to a constitutionally based\nCourt system that uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result if your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately to change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become just an enormously bitter blow for the\nPeople who who thought up into election night two thousand sixteen they were short Hillary Clinton was going to when they go at the two justices you got him\nAnd Hillary bin ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that it will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you ah Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this protection for the midterms\nIs air has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics and so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't going to happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they could be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way there's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right but it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one pay you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic ah and we won the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOf how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now heads or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in\nNorth Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points in his in ah\nTennessee as people we have to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system brightness in starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up protecting remotely I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know somebody out is a separate go and say ah where is the worst of the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races\nAnd some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for so many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been\nA run by Rick Scott and and to the idea of turning that state over as critical as that said in the country electoral politics\nTo a guy who was basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is um [noise]\nThe latest great hope\nBecause you came out of nowhere as a radical Democrat or he won an upset primary victory a heat the key temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one\nOf the ten highest rated governors or Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win or the landslide and the reasons exactly why uh we're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas\nAnd I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again\nThe difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work and I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign has to draw the distinction between results and resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nHolder was a perfect example of the resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA\nI think that's I I don't think people like that they had not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but\nI think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides and I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into what's you know fifty seat pickup [noise] ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments\nMaxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible you know jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on employment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out your people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know that George shores and others actually pay for them or which doesn't you know does that justify I'm\nBut the whole system that the left to try to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh advance before the mid term elections and there's one on October Fifteen\nOr where you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich Neal be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's

get done\nThis is what my my my wake up call to everybody would be let's talk policy if we're talking politics and separate the rats all downhill from it because that distracts us All right there on the Trump between good for the black community and and they want to try and good but let's evaluate him on that\nThey want to distract from the success so they can whip people up and do a perpetual state of her age and then they think OK American music awards register to vote near down twenty five percent the ratings are at rice go to Andrea Nevada line for Andrea welcome\n[noise] right I wouldn't really so happy to know the economy's going to the White House I'm African American woman\nI Am a wall and I love our president so much and I really like I said that I guess like programs like CNN pretending like they're representing all of us are not\nConsider my ... my cup of couch in person so we're not represent who a lot of water you're not represent me I really love our president\nFor black people not to completely gray that's more than\n... our law we must do it on a show and I haven't looked at it one speech that Obama made because I Can't stand them looking\nAt All right Andrew we appreciate it let's go to a Cheryl Colorado are very quickly Cheryl\nLaura my comments ... our prompted by the CNN panel with Don Lemon and the other night you played a portion of it but you didn't play the offensive portion [noise] um I guess we ... we have we done OK sorry I didn't I didn't hear that but you know what I'm referring to um what kind of\nPeel back another layer the onion about how the liberals the media don't give a rip about minorities he said you said they want a mano climatic voting bloc they do because it's a means to an end that and is absolute power\nI think it's it's always been about power and the power is to change the American social construct\nThey want to destroy the foundations of this country so they can rebuild it no way that they think it should have been built in the first place they hate the founding of this country they think the country was founded on corrupt principles and a corrupt way that it was staff from the American Indians and the Mexicans and it's now time to restore the order\n\n\nAnd\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves it it should go to

literature and history a bill I Want to talk about\nWhat you see because you know one of the smartest political analyst out there with all your experience reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight style a type of frenzy in the streets\nWere bought or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country so you have\nGuys like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well\nWith unlimited amounts of money who basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do [noise]\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabin or hearings\nThat send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted people\nWho are paid to do certain things\nYou know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't\nAccidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it begins this huge money behind it but they don't now\nThey promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling of this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been health saw has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nIn the way I just laid it out to you and your listeners are just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness ... whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change our it and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money to radical left people\nAll right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year by George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported lore deer that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's that's what's happening and you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties we've had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods are there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a feed her thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ...\nCause in the media is the same cause the George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much [noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was leaked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the windows are all lying by the way they were all line two and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now no new two of them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm\nRight and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to want to make a decision by the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got Kavanaugh they almost got him and this is kind of country why ... is is it\nYou're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nAccept it because it's been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth the only the apparatus\nIs the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should release\nThem and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence due process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say don't matter\nPresumption of innocence or somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it they're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and have that\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing and I think bill I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nTell I Am ... I Am petrified of this I I completely agree with you and I was slammed for the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the uh kicked to the curb denounced um put up on a cross crucified lose a promotion\nThis has got to stop that 'cause I got out but anybody well and it had happened it happened to me at ... obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation in in one Syracuse is something where do you do to get your information that way\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of the capital and mess when you call them posted on Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm it's about ... exactly about how are you or a truth has replaced bought truth\nOkay so ... and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now watch them on our Christine for 'em and and I I mean I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nI'm I'm I'm interested in the people behind her ... you know I first got flag could is when she her letter was leaked and immediately she hired the most radical left attorneys in the country\nAnd I said to myself if you're a victim of an assault is that where you go no\n... going to go there\nSomebody's ... years of experience in this rice area that's where you go that was a huge red flag and of course the press ignored it you\nWill you'll be you'll be were two thousand Eighteen ...

here boy it's been a very quick day lots going on obviously yesterday we're looking at the markets right now the ... three and a point the Dow was up last time I looked at it was up ... points so we're seeing the volatility start to come back in again again some of these algorithms are kicking and nothing is really really happened\nI'm In the markets or to to indicate that we did get a pretty good consumer price index so inflation actually for the year has gone down is the under two points we present from two forty seven percent that's very good news people like that because they feel like okay that's good\nDefense and not going to have to take care of that\nBy raising rates anymore they're going to continue to raise rates so it's just been a lot of volatility obviously yesterday there were some profit taking there were some selling there was some moving at the volume was very heavy yesterday so there were some conviction\nOr I don't know what the volume is today but based on the swings I Would say it's probably pretty heavy as well so far today so\nNow people are taking advantage of it buying in taking advantage of that debt that we had yesterday I hate to see that go to waste if you are a partner with this ministry I Hope you're tracking and found a long and I hope I hope\nThat you of all listened to this entire program and you continue to listen if you miss look folks look if you don't get the second hour if you don't get the first hour\nOr if you don't you know get the third our\nYou we there's no reason not to get it if you want to continue to stay engaged

two you know we've got all those other things you listed financial issues you got to just go to your Roku box you download F I S M dodge TV or a financial issues that you could watch on your TV so\nThere's no excuse and we've got five hundred and Seventy radio station ... somewhere we don't we're on we have five hundred and Seventy stations that that ah allow us in the program so\nReally great every single day for the last two months I have no idea what's going on why this has happened I haven't asked for it I haven't talked about it but I'm getting emails I ... I you know I get them from time to time but not like the last couple of months\nAnd I've been getting emails from people saying can you please ask\nYour second hour or your third our\nTo the radio station I I'm not in the radio station\nWe we have studios\nIn outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where we broadcast and from that studio goes out to all these stations so I Know it sounds like a local less you realize that that accent certainly is not an accent from Alabama or Louisiana or Boston a and you figure that\nThat you know it you're you're on a fixed income you know you have you got a pension you got a four one K. you got Social Security or whatever you have there you know what that is\nAnd so it all it all comes to uh you don't want to use some of that income to put aside in in emergency savings you already have that [noise] so uh I Would say if you have been relatively new home you don't feel like you feel like most of the maintenance or things that\nCan happen you're going to do out of your regular you know just your normal income stream from on a regular basis you don't have any debt\nYou know certainly you want to have a ten thousand dollar you know emergency savings account eight to ten thousand dollars but I Would say as you get closer to that retirement and you're now you're you know two years away from retirement you want to have that build up a little bit more\n[noise] um yeah no I agree with that that not because I get it from like the working perspective that a long time to go like okay I'm On the market in the mind right round Margaret expensive six months expenses what every year and I just didn't know if\nI guess I heard your last Frank I'm somebody asked about well how much money do you eat you know have that before you can retire at you had let them know that you should be able to plan on a five or six percent\nReturn so I get as far as like OK shooting for an income strain to be able to let on right but then I was just wondering okay like in addition to that you you you know how\nHow much they pay us the percentage or I guess if there is not that wasn't really work but\nLike well I I mean remember ten years ago Fifteen Years ago I Would have been worried not not I mean if you worked Fifteen Years younger I'd be worried about I'd ask you things like what kinds of jobs do you have the feel secure in your jobs have seniority\nIf the downturn in the economy would you likely get laid off because you're in the construction industry or would you be fined because you work for the local government or you're a teacher\nYou know so I Would look at those things are critically important when you think because if I lose my job do I have enough income to carry me Kerry my expenses\nFor six months so very different situation I'm not as concerned about that for two reasons one is your little closer to retirement\nA you're a little bit older I Hope you have some you know real sense of security and your job\nAnd the other thing is we live in an environment right now where um the threat of you know lay offs and losing a job um aren't as\nBig a deal as say they would've been seven or eight years ago [noise] so I think I think the important issue is to take care of those emergency expenses that you don't want to get in debt to fix so well\nI have a credit card if my furnace blows up I'll use credit car well yeah but now you got the debt and you're going to survive that dead for a lot of years\nSo that's not a good strategy a better strategy is my furnace blows up I've got savings that I can replace it with so for and you know or maybe you have income that you can use you know but so I Would just keep it isolated to those things and everybody is it a little bit of a different situation and that\nThat ... area that's why I hate to say you ought to have five percent of your income for ten percent of your income or you know one third of your annual gross salary you know committed to her emergency savings because it\nMay not it may not be the case said it all you know\nSo I Would just try to work backwards towards some worst case scenarios and what would happen right now and do I have emergency savings to take care of that sort of wants to get in that\nOK okay thank you very much\nAll right Bonnie I'm Glad you called I sure do appreciate thank you for your partnership that's great uh sure appreciate it [noise] let me go to stand stand also calling it was time to stand also calling us from Ohio a stand\nAlone to an good morning here last year saying by speaking the gospel turn for financial aid but I'm In the street\nAnd better question about my ability to specific stock and bond reference or not a teacher and coaching or their finances are rushing retirement funds\nAnd leaving it legacy for the next generation\nI'm not a licensed broker a pastor right right but I was wondering what the lion was someone said oh I lost money because of you and you're not a a licensed\nStockbroker vitro sales personally yes the white handled\nSales personally yes\nHandle financial liability my scenario minister\n[noise] well I don't think you really have a liability and they're um the liability comes when you're charge you know see\nThat's when you have a liability so if you charge somebody if somebody says you know a pastor I was thinking about investing money can you help me\nAnd you said you know what for you know I for sixty five dollars an hour you know I'm I'm you know I'd be happy to help you then you got a liability um [noise] so I wouldn't be too concerned about liability\nBut even me one of the things that I Want to do more than anything else and it may be easier in the environment in which you're working for you to do this\nBut my our goal should be you and I stay in our goal should be that the people that are in front of us that we want to convict them to bring Jesus into their money\nWe want to convict them that as they would try to walk closer in their day to day world activities with Jesus that they would not separate\nAnd compartmentalize their finances that that that too would be a part of their walk and face\nAnd we want to convince them of that we want to share the versus you know you hear me say that God says\nUh for those you honor me so I see on or not he says that in in first hand me a whole chapter to at the end of chapter to and you and and that you kind of have to read that whole chapter to get a feel for that promise\nNow I don't know how that what that honor looks like and I don't think we should be promising prosperity but I Do believe we can say you'll get a sense of peace\nUm uh by knowing that you're not grieving the heart of God with how you're investing your money\nAnd it's important that we pray about how we should do that where we should go and some ideas this as you speak you know some ideas would be look from what I understand there are\nThere's really only one mutual fund company that you can diversify your portfolio\nAnd diversification is important so you ought to call this Timothy planned group and talk to him where you can fully diversify your portfolio there are couple other biblical responsible funds you heard me maybe yesterday recommend a a um inflation protected bond fund for somebody\nThat was a bit bulky responsible to ban guard fun typically responsible most\nGovernment bond funds are biblical you responsible so there are some other alternatives but you know or use some of the picks that you know I I Believe in or things if you want to want to do that but you know the ... the key is your job is to convict them do want to do that\nTo to want to make sure\nThat they're not investing in a company they're supporting abortion and pornography gambling and the redefinition it was funny I I Know one is ... I'm I'm a mutual fund company that hosts themselves out as being able to be responsible somebody this morning a friend of mine sent me an article with a picture\nOf this company set up at the uh L. T. G. beach convention um you know I'm a ... or ... ... with the booze\nTry to you know bring\n'em the their their marriage or\nTheir same sex marriage into you know their community I'm investing investment so you know it's and everybody maybe I don't know everybody has a different definition of what's been the response whiny I only know God's word so\n[noise] um [noise] and what that sounds so I don't think you have any liability [noise] and I think the best place to start with any pastor and I've said this disastrous conferences is with conviction [noise]\nThat's great John I'm Glad you asked so here's how it works\nYou own a stock you bought this stock for twenty dollars a share and yesterday it crashes it goes down to ten dollars a share\nAnd let's say you own a hundred shares well when it goes down to ten\nHundred shares well when it goes down that way and if you buy another hundred shares\nUs just dollar cost averaging down your share price now your share price your cost basis for your share price your average cost basis is Fifteen dollars\nAnd you don't have to wait for the stock to get all the way back up to twenty once it gets to Fifteen\nYour back even if it does go back to twenty you're up significantly\nThat dollar cost averaging down now used a very simple example of doubling up on your shares and all that most people don't do that but if every time you dollar every time you buy shares bolo what you are religion only pay for\nHow many shares you buy doesn't matter you just lowered the overall average share price for all the shares that you own\nSo when you when you buy a share thirty and now you're buying it at twenty five and then you buy to get a twenty two and then you buy it again at Nineteen you are lowering your average share price\nFor all all of the stock that you won't\nSo when you do that and you're a long term investors I Hope everyone is you you you now are doing yourself a great service because one you don't have to wait as long\nTo get profitable because your costs basis was lower so you don't have to wait as long and number two when it does recover fully back up again to where it was you're going to make a whole lot more money instead of just breaking even\nSo that to a dollar cost averaging is and you hear me say sometimes want no no don't buy into it now I don't want you to dollar cost averaging ... up\nIn other words I don't necessarily want you to buy I Do it all the time because I'm looking way out in the future and I say I don't care if it's up on buying I you know I'm looking at belong to a very long term outlook but I don't ... you know that's not a good practice to get into the dollar cost averaging up unless you really want more shares about stock\nBut your dollar cost averaging up you don't want to do that that means you bought it at twenty and a six months later to twenty five and you've decided to like the stock and you buy more twenty five that's not necessarily good thing because now you're raising your average share price\nBut I may be okay because it may be on the move upward and onward for a long time\nSo that's what that's all about it's really good to understand the principles of that when you're managing logs or money is a very good to do that and hopefully a you understand that I Hope I explained that right\nSomebody is asking true grit is asking using your income port for full year to cover your R. M.\nD. I'm I was going to buy seal twenty five but you moved it to your broad ... still will go no\nIf you don't own it don't buy it yep Bye bye moves that I'm very intentionally this morning off my by list if you own it and you want a dollar cost averaging down that's fine but no do not buy it um\nJust just leave it alone All right so hopefully that that helps you\nFolks reverse rule of thumb maybe you're not a partner maybe becoming a partner maybe you're going to a partner up with a ministry by the way if you want to make a donation and you want to uh um ... do it by phone you can call six one oh six zero one\nThree six six three that six one six zero one three six six three\nThat to make a donation you also be a partner that way if you want to just not up yet but it will be in the next
