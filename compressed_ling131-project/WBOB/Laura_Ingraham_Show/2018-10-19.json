reacting to the same bite you just heard president\nAmong the this is John Burma reacting to the same by you just heard President Trump saying I Love doing this guy mark who's running for Congress in ... in Montana [noise]\nAh I Love any body slammed that reporter and yeah he was charged your body so I guess a reporter came up to them was abused will be full body slammed my guys thought Trump was tickled\nBy it and said so on the stump John Berman said this\nNothing like making a joke at a body slamming a reporter what another journalist was his name or his fingers cut off three weeks ago and administration has been dealing with that damage control and trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter Jake comes by the Scottish\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... D G A GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana bottom ... does is Walsh with you does\nThis negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa that whole ah explosion of violence in hate\nWe're seeing does a congressman in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump's side comment I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Leslie stall which we we decomposed ... or ... ... a demystify that interview written decompose that we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Leslie stall unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term\nOr will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think cliff what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nTo the polls is better than the crafts I Believe or behind this march\nAnd drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their bathrooms who's trying to treat him coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and publish it and that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into it in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly a an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more\nI don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers have emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this\nAnd it's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the caravan we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that's their ticket in if you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan clip thank you very much for the call out with also share some other uh reports with you here of how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in the lower Ingram we're right back stay there\n\nBill O'Reilly here my new book in the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled it\nThe book will stun you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than twelve million copies so I Hope you check out killing the s fast it's\nWell worth your time are you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect divide ... served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ransomware just a backup your computer often\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the tenth out there\nI think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent\nAnd but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes the issue [noise] uh and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and the the murder of him and this tremendously it'll or a tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and their season upon this and tried to attach it to the Trump but is it is or what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do what they're going to do since they only I was thinking God I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is he is he is the centerpiece and\nUh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like paternal\nUncharted at all [laughter] but generally gauge as far as the eye can\nSee anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate every sentence they\nWill be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the ... report W looking into alleged alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things in New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC\nSo I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you wanted if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up but you know I hadn't announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad base of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment of the I word impeachment uh last night ... go debate over three and James ... who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd he's dead in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that means that the president has committed a crime that tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in the impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and then make the best informed decision in the interest of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that pat does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it still\nDidn't hear the charge would\nSee exactly what that\nDoes that help no it doesn't help better overall working it was in a and veterans got his own problems these nine or ten born down or sixty two million and the bank I think but I you know no I don't think it helps him I think\nWe're better off work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in parliament for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race and Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from height and there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah your your final laundromat put him in a corner you\nPut you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's good to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over us but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have an answer people overseas crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign and domestic problems\nThat you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy\nThank you that and er into all of you listening what is driving new to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was a one idea that you could not lose an you felt you had to move on\nThat you could not loose and that you felt you had to move on um I keep hearing it was cabin all others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play you a little bit\nIn a little bit with the president said

going to raise a deficit that was from two thousand and seven\n\nAnd two thousand and eight President Obama\nOn the campaign trail in North Dakota said\nGeorge Bush is shameful shameful he said it's unpatriotic it's irresponsible like whoa\nIt was nine trillion dollars he and the Democrats doubled die some for some reason\nWe never commentators ever want to question Democrats'\nOn these ridiculous economic numbers they come up with you know why because all politicians are Republicans and Democrats\nNo one's saying the same thing they've known for that last Thirty years and they believe it has to change that this can only be because enough of them have not run in to financial issues the listeners at town hall meetings\n\nBut wind surveyed the vast majority of voters one surveyed and they're given a multiple choice saying what is the one thing that you know at least our belts before you vote\nAnd when one of the multiple choice answers is the economy it is a number one choice of voters\nNow look let's think of this logically\nIf you're a politician you are giving a speech you're doing a town hall meeting here trying to appeal to your constituencies so that you can get votes\nThink about this maybe it would be an interview\nBy a reporter and you're saying that reporter is probably one of those people that check that box that's the thing they noticed about think about how beautiful this is to politicians\nUnderstand they are free to say whatever they want to say they're free to ally they're free to fabricate numbers\nRather than just put some sort of slant to them they're free to grab some ... left wing think tank group of economic numbers and use them\nAnd if they said very eloquently and they say it with a sense of authority\nAnd often times they they find themselves in need of a supplementing their income they got to dip into this money from time to time and often times it can get out of control or where they might outlive it or it might it might go down and value as they're drawing against it\nSo you gotta have if you're going to take the lump sum if you're going to do that you gotta be able to be in a portfolio that is\nIn my opinion on the wall street got him a stock guy\nI don't so uh my opinion you've got to be loaded up with a good solid companies you don't need to take risk to make money you could have a great salad utility companies other companies preferred stock things that\nAre a little bit low risk they're still always going to be risk but low risk but there are a pain very good dividends\nThat you're making good income you can build an income portfolio that you're actually living off the income\nAnd you're not dipping into principle you don't need to\nBecause you've got enough income you've asked sufficient income that's an ideal situation at the end of ten years not only will you are living off the income but in all likelihood by the end of ten years you're going to have more money than your started with and you're still living off the income\nThat's an ideal situation the vast majority of financial advisors\nDon't manage individual stocks they don't even know where to begin doing that they're putting people in insurance products and they're putting people in mutual funds and they're not even thinking about or anything else because they either can't because they're not property license to do it or they don't know how they wouldn't even know where to begin that's and that's a problem\nNow you're exposing your portfolio sometimes it far more risk [noise]\nThe only thing that I promised people that I can promise you and your friend you can promise your friends\nAnd that the only thing there to care about some day I don't know what day that it will be whether it's Seventy five sixty five eighty five whatever it is there will be a day that the only thing they care about is how much money they have coming in every ...\nThey're not going to care about their portfolio they don't want to think about the economy going down they don't want to be concerned about it they don't want to worry about it they don't want to watch it they don't ... you know all they want to know is they can pay their bills and still live off of what they have coming in and their Social Security and so and so forth\nAnd you've got they've got to be thinking about income so here's the rule of thumb\nThat you can tell them that they ought to consider if they look at the ah county government a county government saying look at the when you when you retire you gonna get\nYou know I'm making up numbers here you're gonna get nine hundred dollars a month in retirement\nIf you take a lump sum you're gonna get nine hundred thousand dollars\nIf there they take the lump sum and they multiply that lumps ... by six percent\nAnd they divide that six percent by twelve twelve months and not income is less than the nine hundred dollars a month that they are being promise for the rest of their life then\nRemember what I said the only thing that I care about so much money they can come and they said that money they had that retirement all their life because they wanted to make more income they wanted to have income to retire on then they got to think long and hard about taking the income\nIf it's close\nThen find it investment advisor a good investment advisor that it's going to put them in individual stocks front and get that six percent maintain the principal and grow that principle so that they're not dipping into principle every month when they take their withdrawal\nYes that's what's got to happen because the kiss of death for every retiree [noise]\nIs going through a two thousand and eight\nAnd there will be another two thousand and eight some point in time and another one after that and you're drawing money out of your principal as the market is coming down\nIf you're in a situation you do that it's never going to cover [noise] you're never gonna recover it's almost impossible and it and it destroys the portfolio\nIf you're drawing money outfit is water to Ernie and those earnings continue even when the value is going down who cares so I deal if you don't have to care because the value is going to come back up showing a recovery backup if you haven't taken the principal so\nThere are some of the fundamental things that you need to help\nThere are some of the fundamental things that you need to help\nUh your your friends understand that that you know they they've got to look at it very very carefully there is great value and saying I'm going to receive nine hundred and fifty dollars a month for the rest of my life no matter what the economy does yeah and there's something for them to be said for that\nYes [laughter] that's great that's great information makes total sense and I I think the gentleman that does my um\n[noise] you know manage just mine is a brother or Asian my church is trying anyway but each garage very conservative on I think he's done away or you know\nThe ... it's just like you're saying right right I think his job I think it's done well I mean you know yeah I'm so I'm just trust completely you know\nIf he wants me to do differ on your show man and so that's that's my heart\nAnd yeah yeah that's great well that's that's where your heart should be and you know I Hope that if somebody that's thought maybe somebody that's missing to the program that that knows about being biblical responsible with those investments that were not\nGrieving in the heart of God by investing our money and pornography and abortion and those things and you know that's another that's a whole nother issue and something that you might want to uh\nUh talk to them about because\nUm I can you know a assure you the Lord's going to honor that and I'm blessed that as well so it sounds like you could you're doing the right thing you got your heart and the right place but you know there's that some great food for thought to get to your friends to they really need to help they need to understand that\nAnd um there's some great advisors out there they're just hard to find\nYeah you're right and uh [noise] so anyway thank thank you God Bless you Dan and thanks so much for your ministry and I'll be ... in\n... well I sure appreciate the phone I I just ah thank you for finding the program I'm Glad you found out\nAnd uh yeah I'm sure I'm sure you\nTell your friends about it and you keep them less than a theory of the questions you give us a call thanks for God Bless you\nWrite that you\nYou have good stuff and you know uh it is so it is so important that we you know I Know I talk about their so often folks I because it is my heart why I'm here\nI Want to do a couple of things you know I Believe with all my heart this ministry as an educational ministry\nI also believe that that ah it's an educational ministry I Know this for a fact that educational ministry that I never wanted [laughter] never wanted I winded moan about it for years when I was on the first on the radio I it's not something I I aspired to do\nUm [noise] but coming to the notion\nThat whether I like it or not it's the gifts God has has ah let me and I\nPray that I uh can now use them for his good and if I'm helping you to understand some things\nSelfishly\nI get to participate\nIn growing the kingdom\nBecause you all will feel better about your money\nNo you're not reading the heart of God no believe in first Samuel to where the lord says for those who want to me so shell I honor knowing that you're going to be receiving God's blessings and you're going to be able to give more\nI'm not talking about giving more I'm not sure that the kingdom of financial issues is not what I'm Talking about something about the kingdom of Christ was talking about you giving to your church\nBecause your church is seen people come to the saving grace of Jesus Christ that's what I'm Talking about you're going to be able to get to great ministries they're proclaiming the gospel and proclaiming the truth\nAnd I get to kind of behind the scenes selfishly participate\nIn your\nActive obedience and giving to the kingdom work I'm telling you folks
