September seventeenth\nDuring the Kevin are crush\nThe Trump Administration is designing a plan presented by UN ambassador Nikki Haley for President Trump to hold a meeting at the un that was next week a couple of weeks ago focused on Iran according to diplomats familiar with the meeting Haley had announced that Trump\nWould share a meeting on the world's biggest diplomatic stage quote to address Iran's violations of international law in general instability Iran so throughout the entire Middle East region\nFocusing the meeting on Iran drew immediate concerns from us allies who believe that the topic would expose sharp disagreements among the U.S Britain and France\nOver the twenty Fifteen Iran nuclear deal which Trump unilaterally withdrew from an may other U.S officials also voiced concerns that an article of UN Charter would allow Iran to participate in the meeting because it's quote a party to do this to the dispute under consideration\nRaising the prospect of an awkward in contentious stand up between Trump\nAnd representative of Iran\nSeems like the Trump Administration was right about this one stay there\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ratio and here's how it works with a ratio you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part of rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nCan you can you can you\nUsing her phrase can we segment some of the James so I can listen to it again I mean I'm just a little ... right now because I haven't slept enough maybe I'm just a little tired last night was a big night\nNo it was a very I mean I'm going to I I had to put the champagne glass down and then go do my show last night\nAnd we were celebrating at the White House it was fantastic everybody who helped Brett was there all the justices were there everybody was there who\nYou know who who really was instrumental in helping the nomination this confirmation his law clerks his old law clerks who helped it was great great to see everybody but maybe I'm just a little tired so I Can't follow the\nBrilliant and incisive logic of costs the court says well\nI think a lot of it has to do a changing our strategy around with her hands you know there's a lot of baseball and inside the beltway as you know you really say that term thrown around\n...\n... these just asked you what are you going to do and she answers well we're changing our governance strategies inside baseball I'm a forgive me but she at least what I've heard\nShe seemed like a very attractive person and maybe she's a very nice individual I'm sure she's a nice person she got people to go out and vote vote for her she probably a nice person I don't understand what she's saying we need more organizers okay you'll be in government you will be in there\nBut you see all goes back to what I'm saying they have NO PLAN for how to improve this economy it's all about creating the new social construct to lay on top of the u._s. understanding\nAs it has to be like\nAll abortion all gender fluidity higher taxes open borders legalize everyone legalize drugs pot all all of it has to be fully sit on the American people\n[noise] so like Obama she never really will leave the organizing world\nThere are various ... organizers will Congress and I think that organizers operate differently it's different kind of strategy\nYeah they they they have enough money for mommy and daddy to just walk around with these profane signs and whale and moan and claw at things like the Supreme Court big brats door\nThat Supreme Court video how many have you thought it was as funny as I did so last night on the angle every time I kicked off a Trump agenda item winning agenda item every time I did that\nWe played a snippet of of the protesters clawing at the door to make a point the better things are getting in America the more than happy they are\nBut the ... I just found that to be a ...\nBy the way there are a lot of different angles that people got what their cell phone videos of the protesters clawing up the door so you can see like the the hundred and twenty pound guy\nLooks like wearing skinny jeans he's banging then you go you see the woman there's like this will this liberal woman who's like trying to pry open each of these doors if I Walk through them enough times I Know\nThese doors probably way their their ceremonial doors\nThey probably way I don't know four hundred pounds their giant\nClawing at the door is trying to open them\nThis is kind of a metaphor though isn't it for what they're they're trying to their clawing and banging at the more traditional understanding of America [laughter]\nShould America down this is\nNot shutting the traditional understanding of America down to about ... you know they know they're not going to shut the Supreme Court ... court is going to go on I heard oral arguments this morning they continue to go on\nBut it's about shutting down you\nYour voice intimidating you so you got your back in the corner of an elevator\nIt's about shutting down this idea of traditional families\nIt's about shutting out the idea of understanding of American history shut it down pulling statues down with the ropes in the middle of the night it's all a piece of what they are and what they become\nAnd its public schools it's private schools it's colleges it's indoctrination it's the mass migration of the country of people who are here legally who are not brought up to understand what makes this country so great in our in our history\nTo understand why this is so important to preserve our country you really do have to understand why how it was so hard to founded this country the American founding against all odds we founded this great republic\nIn the term rent tremendous sacrifice of our framers the original are signatories of our constitution great sacrifice I made\nBut if you don't understand any of that then you kinda just arrived here in America that we can make money here boys is so great can make money China make money and you know cut our roommate money a lot

about the way you protest ... whether it's a dignified or undignified\nNow we're not seeing a lot of Rosa Parks out there today we're not seeing the classic non violent classy way of protesting this is a ... approach to protest\nTo run senators out of restaurants go to their home is that going too far [noise]\nI think that is their rules that there are a lot of people who are very very much I'm motivated so what is going on ... because ... and all that kind of force in our country\nShe went to the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez school of logic apparently or her on her own no one to hers or Alexander I went to her own and I was I Can't tell which\nSo in other words Mazie Hirono God help you in Hawaii Mazie Hirono wants more of this people people\nAre upset that I keep saying this but I'm going to say it again imagine if conservative activists\nKamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered into the elderly\nKamala Harris James imagine what would happen Kamala Harris gets cornered into the elevator with conservatives pointing and screaming at her and she's she's backed into the corner of an elevator imagine what they would say what's on the left what do they say it was anti women it was intimidating it was harassment\nThey would claim that all Republicans who didn't denounce that type of\nOf a a behavior and conduct that you were anti women and it would be a thousand percent Trump's fault it would be no thank you it would be all Trump salt in this case why don't we hold Democrat leaders responsible for these type of protest they should be held responsible they're not condemning it\nAnd and they have their moment where they said well maybe Maxine Waters went a little too far that lasted for like five milliseconds but they hold Trump responsible for Charlottesville I say they are responsible the Democrat leadership are responsible for the lefty is running the asylum\nIn these protests and teeth and all of it\nEight five five forty

to break that last hour [noise]\nOkay so I'm going to get to your calls aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three we've got some questions on Facebook someone you too so I had a a call are

keep awareness okay that\nMust be really pretty gutless you\nThank you Tom uh let me go to a let\nMe you know what let me just answer a couple of questions on YouTube that we are in fact the phones phones are aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three I'm\nCraig thank you drags just make it a comment on a particular stock or it is a great stock in perjury well um\nAnd and ah today you know maybe a good day to start you know to add to it a little bit but anyway great great company [noise] um let's see Tony asking me if I said did you say the forty four [noise]\nA was a foundational stock no I did not say that I say I was a we were talking about ... ah another stock that was foundation or wasn't he forty four though\nUm I don't remember what it was but it wasn't me forty four\nI'm so it's a ... oh I I Know what it was yeah no it was in it was in a wasn't even a a EnergyStar that we were talking about I remember yeah we talked about the same color that stock but that's not the one that was the foundation of stock [noise]\nUh Dan is saying uh\nOur preferred preferred valued went inherited\nAt the market or the ... you know a preferred are always\nPart value that never changes now\nThe ... the value of the price can go down or up there's the where it is right now if it's called it's always going to get called at par value\nIf you inherited it and when you when Harry did it was Seventeen dollars a share and the poor values twenty five then and you sell it\nThen you still have you know a stepped up bases so your costs space is going to be whatever the person you inherited from bought it\nSo from a cost basis standpoint that's how you would figure it's so if they bought it at twenty five and a Seventeen when you inherited it or not when you inherited boat or a ... on the date of death of the person your heritage and from\nThen yes that would Seventeen dollars would be your costs basis so if it's now at twenty and you sell it you would have capital gains tax\nOf that are three dollars per share so uh but when it gets cold going to get called at twenty five [noise] ah someone's\nAsking me Dan I'm Richards asking me Dan I have an investment in income stocks I have a nice\nA average yield a but a small loss made me from to stocks I'm concerned about one of those stocks does it ever longtime term upside well [noise]\nI if you're concerned about it I Would sell it I'm not concerned but if you're concerned about it I Would sell at a it's an income stock if you have an income stock you're not supposed to be concerned about any income stocks you only concerned about the income that you're receiving\nAnd as long as you're getting income from it every single my list has been a long term upside as far as Oxford so I you know every thing on my list long term housing upside to it\nUm if it does and I'm probably going to put it on my cell list but um I Would not be concerned about that if you are truly an income investor if you are concerned about gross\nAnd your income investor then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to be thinking about some different kind of growth stocks so I don't know if that helps you are not Richard maybe it does [noise]\nUh let me go to sue sue is calling us from Texas to\nThe point of fact a sure fire way about it and I guess they were paying for replacing her to the courthouse a good point\nAnd much better much better points that I made about any of that so yes a good point I appreciate your bringing it up because we she was such a strong person in that very important position we pray that God raises up another person as strong as for sure good points thank you for sharing that\nAnd then you know getting quite that\nYes yeah yeah exactly 'cause I don't think she's going anywhere she's going to be in the in the life for a while I Believe\nI think of right now if they bring our faith that we are thinking\nNo doubt about it I'm with you on that to God's praise God\nYep [laughter] thank you [laughter] okay I like I said and I are talking point on it or anything that will take them all\nLike I said and I are old self employed I'm an attorney in the real estate broker on any level one nine we currently have three teenagers at home I don't want anything pilot on or near Dallas the other two are in high school\nI mean they're not paying for the house with everything they need to pay for college they get bored and they don't wait for them to do something for all of our other children as well right but we had lost pretty happy over the last\nDecade on all things a lot of our our paintings but we're we are right now we have killed apartment building\nThat quite a while to hundred thousand dollars of equity I'm a little bit ... hundred thousand and it's a little bit more perhaps we're looking at selling those um and so and then we have about a hundred and thirty thousand dollar mortgage on our house we have no other that but we do not have the same thing\nGo like but then you know what we're seeing is that\nWe take that equity out of the apartment building and thirty one into something out\nOr get me out and start building a dad kept me out and buy our way you know what the plan or we can continue for war or a great long time but we are self employed and we all know often it but we want it yeah that's\nRight so if you are getting your your obviously getting positive\nCash flow additives apartment [noise]\nWe are but they are located in another state and about an hour one way drive so that was one of our thought what do we we are a great\nState of high income taxes and high taxes will they get to that so now they are they are a distance from up so that was one of his knee why we were thinking of selling them and then re purchasing closer to me that\n[noise] yeah so um I think that's a fine idea if you're okay having real estate\n[noise] uh I don't think you're going to do better from an income perspective and anything you do a\nBetter that's going to be better than the than the real estate and I think the idea of tend to you know I mean obviously I Would find get get some property lined up 'cause you obviously understand the time limit there you have to get that reinvest it\nThat's a that's a great idea I I think that you know whether I don't know how much equity a you say you've got about two hundred thousand dollars of equity and you've got two hundred thousand or two thirty on your on your mortgage um\nI I mean from my perspective based on what you've said I probably would I'm looking at\nUsing the equity to take care of your income needs for your retirement not necessarily to pay off the income or the mortgage now at some point in time when you do or tier if you don't work if you stop working then there's always a question of it is you were you know mortgage gonna become burdensome\nUh to to pay for that every month and now the the positive cash flow that you have in this new real estate investment\nIs a you know going mostly to pay that mortgage since you don't have the income anymore and that's where you have to think about I Would probably take the approach that I Would\nI'm\nNot still still leave things the way they are if you work another five years I Would wait you know that's going to you may be getting to the place in the mortgage where a lot more of your principal maybe have opportunity with some of the new Josh [noise] slowed the you generate to\nPay towards other principal\nAnd relieve some of the time you have left to pay that\nAnd I would rather see you do that and I think that makes much more sense so I Would do the ten ten thirty one exchange I Would get that done\nI think that makes good sense I Would do it sooner rather than later because I'm concerned about this the um you know the the sale of the property you know I I don't know where it is but you do and it might be in a great area and you're not concerned about that\nBut uh I Would do it sooner rather than later um get that sale\nAnd start reinvest\nIt very ironic say that and I always believe that God you know put people together or by this area we bought a about ten years ago with the idea that the area with increasingly protected\nFive or six years and it's just that he ... right now there is a very great shortage\nOf airfare and there and it's something about prices all over the price to pay a hundred thousand maybe more\nAnd if that's the case I think they're going to be hard pressed to make that happen without selling but the problem is they may sell to a private\nCompany which would be the likely thing for them to do [noise] if they do that's not going to be good for the stock holders or if they don't they\nThey do that's not going to be good for the stock holders or if they don't and they were to sell to you know Chevron or something then that would be good for the stock holders so I'm In a really depends it's too hard of a call to make\nYeah [noise] okay Dan thank you so much oh Reichert You're welcome appreciate the call thank you thank you for your partnership aid for for seven or seven fifty\nFive thirty three joined if you're caught you are welcome to do that we'll get back get back to calls that we could go back to YouTube and Darren is asking about I think already answered
