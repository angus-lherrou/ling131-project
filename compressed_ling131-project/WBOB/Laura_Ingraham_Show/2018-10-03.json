forty Laura ah let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\n[noise]\nUm I I just wanted to say I think um everyone tries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible but that's because it's the polite thing to say it's a politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists I I think\nAnybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible\nAnd Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social lie and he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up\nAnd and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here and I\nI appreciate it eight five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through\nWith no contemporaneous cooperation who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it\nAnd same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it\nWe know people who practice emotional extortion a political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism so conservatives need not apply

president a hundred percent but you know the war on women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case you know a doctor for whether you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they didn't they exposed it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this these people were paid by the center of public democracy\nOr they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting that listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple of years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think uh you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense\nAnd everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake our in the elevator and then you get the yelling at me he turns out the woman is a ... executive director of of a Soros funded group as he said Center for democracy and I think it's time to turn the tables were again sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just go to good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive the others I I Would say of there\nAre inherent civil rights and I totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some Congress people represented Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nThere apps get up and absolutely harass them Nancy Pelosi I don't know how they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on to tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans where they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and if it doesn't do anything else that you serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats have been playing office for the last hundred years it's time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense is is this is the time right now\nA senator Purdue uh there's so much a that is happening ... which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been unreal meant and laying on romantically negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay a or B she'd have to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big blow the eight or ... or Obama ridiculed made his way to go on for some are going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work\nI and and you don't hear nothing out of this huge milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did\nUnder President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the nuclear option of North Korea this president's agenda is working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the office talking about what's working in his agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or tried to harassment restaurant okay there's a new I tolerate that anyone in my family and my kids they they they better be they better be really ready because this is not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents and in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your three square meals a day in your ear you know your your activism on the side of it I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be ... this week and it starts right here in the United States Senate people who are supporting this actively encouraging and signing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nWithout a doctor for it or anything else these are paid activists this was a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them and stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nYou think we have enough Republican money banks types\nTo counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and ... and to voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nOr this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and in land a line on them like oh Trump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams Abrams who's lost\nWeight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia is drawn thirty million dollars\nFrom um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and Soros into other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there and it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday it seemed to kind of shift the goalposts little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee a lot less than\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks uh the initial a defense to judge Kavanaugh gave ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on\nAnd the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of the old ...\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... in the face of the old ...\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment this ring court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of disapproving these allegations that presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets not convenient for the Democrats I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause an evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just the tip of the spear of what they're of all of their ... activity I have actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit not likely voters hum and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or this governorship is very important for so many reasons for the state of Georgia\nA and the growth a economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that gross\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants to all these getaway programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nIt's a what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else has can do the issue Georgia right now is rated the best state in the country in which to do business and she wants to tear that day out we have a great Republican candidate blind camp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little uh a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet deal I think we should make this a huge issue down there and push push this uh this Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out in the cabinet thing\nBut I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in the figurative way not literally I said don't start talking about you know you can say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little

Ford was continuing to charge on their credit card\nOr after they broke up well it's not that big of a deal when confronted Dr ... Ford said she did not use the card but later admitted to the use after he threatened to involve per fraud prevention I didn't speak again to Ford until after two thousand to one Ford contacted\nHer brief him briefly um\nSo there you are a you're listening to the lower income show All right uh we have more information more news will get to all your calls coming up congressman Andy Harris was a victim of the left intimidation campaign yesterday and we'll talk about what happened when we come back\n\n\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI just wanted to keep you up to date on how things are progressing so I'm getting down to the nature every month maybe sometimes twice a month for my friend who had a MRI done CAT scan or last week\nA very good friend of ours too as a teaching ... told me two years ago she's going to be gone within six months\nI'm so happy that for down for nature [laughter] because\nAnything else we're just not doing it for her\nWhen you go use discount code Laura and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free coal eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nTo change the law obviously that's what some of these individual doing by tempting to elect people who said I'm going to abolish ice I disagree with that but again we can have a public discussion but you don't have to get physical you don't have to threaten someone and again it it it it's sad when you know when when a member of Congress goes out and says\nUh this is the way you should protest is you know getting people's faces confront them uh it's not civil it's not right it's not the way I was raised and I guess some people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable and ended up in a free country\nSome people are just raised differently in terms of what they think is acceptable it ended up in a free country\nA congressman Harris and your thoughts on the overall political climate in America I Know you sit in the house of representatives but given\nWhere this Kavanaugh confirmations saga has gone with unsubstantiated allegations most all of them are falling apart now\nOf ... people are finally coming out and saying whoa I Know this person should help to help someone take a polygraph wants clearly lied under oath if that's the case he's a firsthand witness a visceral the whole Bo [noise]\nUm and it seems to me that we have a lot of people with a lot of money who are unhappy that\nDonald Trump became president and by any means necessary they will attempt to derail his agenda but not with substance with again these types of stunts\nOh oh absolutely Laura ... in the media is the right front and center on this\nI'll tell you you know I was kind of a physician and I watched that testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who watch the testimony comes up the inclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview and I was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now\nI didn't say that but that's the that's what the media water to portray they have an agenda and and that's that's what's so different now than for Thirty years ago the agenda is so obvious is so arid a for many many members of the media the president by good\n\nGoalie calling it on its face and uh that had that had to be done and of course he gets criticized when he goes out to\nA congressman Harris thank you so much for that update you're listening to lower angering show at five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls in a more information on this ah\nMonica McLean ah here we go she was a friend of she has a friend of a Ford's a so Ford was in ... beach Delaware on July twenty six twenty Eighteen\nAnd her lifelong friend ... Monica McClain who worked as an attorney a for a P. O. Y. which is a ... D OJ and FBI and a robust beach Delaware apparently both of them are there at the same time that she wrote her a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nA Ford and ms McLean her best friend or the best friend she actually coached on lie detector testing were\nTogether for the four days leading up to the actual writing of the letter from the twenty sixth of the thirtieth\nIt would appear this is a conservative a tree house it would appear that Ford was with McLean again the retired FBI agent and former former New York field office spokesperson at the time she wrote the letter the Feinstein\nThat would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling ms Ford and how there would be an intentional effort from a subject matter expert on how to best position the attack against Kavanaugh\nWho better described the Internet history and know what process sees and people to enlist in such preparatory work than a retired lawyer who were deeply inside the FBI a lot of people are saying deep state was involved in all this not only did ms McLean possess a particular set of skills to assist assessments forward\nBut ms McLean would also have a network of D. O. J. an FBI resources to assist in this endeavor\nA former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph a network of politically motivated allies\nDoes the appearance of FBI insider and deputy FBI Director uh to Andrew Andrew McCabe Michael Brown which begin now to make\nMore sense think about it remember the lawyer she ultimately got with brown which brown which list is Andy McCabe lawyer get Andy McCabe former deputy director the FBI\nAnd we know that ah\nWell flight called McCabe before but not the case of the um Rosenstein excuse me before they he decided to ask for that extra week and that that that doesn't really bother me because they want to know what you can get done in a week an FBI background\nBut this FBI connection with the woman she was now reportedly within ... beach it's fascinating\nSo again if you want to examine whether she misled the committee put this country through a nightmare you need all her text messages all her emails\nAll of those that have been deleted which are recoverable and that is\nFor Powell McLean anyone who is ... it was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office all of that needs to be out all of it do you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away from this get away with us excuse me\nThe same thing with Julie sweat neck if you're submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary committee that are false knowingly false you should be prosecuted for that I don't care how long it takes I Would prosecute for that\n... and I I bet that text messaging trail to Christine Ford tells a fascinating story about what really went down\nAnd I'd subpoena that therapists if the therapist even exists subpoena that therapist they look there is no patient a doctor privilege here apparently she was releasing notes and showing them to at least showing some of the Washington Post she references them in her testimony gone no privilege but a lot\nTo uncover here so they want to go through other Brett Kavanaugh use the word drunk in a handwritten note to friends or whether he threw ice Nineteen eighty five I\nI'm not in July what happened that do you what would you be curious to know that I Would I Want to know if a former FBI agent\nUh over who has an enormous amount of institutional knowledge about how to scrub Internet history and other people in the FBI who would know how to do that if Dr Ford knew how to do that on her own someone helped turn this process eight five five forty Laura stay there your reaction up next\n[noise]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the

I'm Sorry gasoline supplies dropped because they were still doing the turnaround a which isn't as big a turnaround as it is in the spring to get to winter gasoline\nAnd so obviously they weren't putting out a lot of gasoline into\nSupplies are inventories that's going to change now that's going to say we're going to start to see gas gasoline inventories come up as they use up some of this eight million barrels we can get into a lot situation if they don't and then gas prices are going to come down\nSo we'll see hopefully that would be great wouldn't be great if we end up headed into the Christmas season with lower gasoline prices lot lower gasoline prices will say this is only one week we have to see if this holds so that's the big news oil prices\nHave a\nClimbed very closely very closely to a four year high now they have been on the decline here the morning they were down last slug about point for four percent\nUh last time I looked right now they have turned up positive that's odd\nBased on this report but they are per turned positive and backup over Seventy five dollars about Seventy five point thirty one so oil prices now are at a four year Heidi's or crude oil prices\nAre inventory numbers even at that and that number now this is going to increase image or he's because everybody's going to want to get in on the Seventy five dollar a barrel oil obviously\nIs going to be also good for oil stocks in the world stocks driving some of these this gasoline prices will\nNot gas up\nTwo and a quarter percent dramatic increase in that gas we're headed into wintertime and that would be reasonable a spot go down\nIt's a great wakeup calls are lured late to play some of those things in my heart so thank you for that day I appreciate you saying that\nThere's one thing America could use Google yeah not\nYeah so I kind of a longer term question or military guy currently working for the okay\nWe're we're pretty comfortable as far as financial go but I really feel like the lord has called me to teach and probably over the country maybe close to the school teachers\nMy I guess my question is currently get my teachers degree through Liberty University a minute mhm so a little bit too long I'm looking at going to the inner city kind of job\nOr the um with my dad would you what I Believe it or the next two years and continue to contribute or do I need to start looking at him on some different\nSo once you leave your G.

I'm In the same situation so from that perspective I wouldn't have a problem with you and also in it um I Would have that money though when you sell it in a somewhat of a separate account and what I mean by that is\nKind of have an account where yeah I've got a couple a government bomb funds are in it or something like that but not a lot of risk you know the kind of account that is that is going to be fairly stable\nUm in any case or something happens where a that could be a good girl fall back at some point in time where you say man I'm going to you know I've got a I've got to an opportunity to serve the lord and in a you know\nSomewhere in Tennessee or\nNorth Carolina or wherever it might end up being and or you can you can pull that money out of there without too much of an impact so I think I think that's what you want to do with it in that case just just sell it and and move any equity over into a good safe secure a camp\n[noise]\n[noise] yeah I think I think the housing market is depends on what goes on with the elections are the elections go the wrong direction in November I think the algae market's going to start to turn sour 'em over the next two years and I think that's I

thing is such a blessing and a I Would love to see more and more people young\nMiddle aged old singles married kids or whatever the situation is I think it's critically important that we do a couple of things you know God gave us a plan\nHealthcare play you give us a healthcare play\nGod reminds us in ... that I don't I don't know the chapter and verse I should I think it's chapter three don't know diverse early single digit first start ups are starting to come to me but um\nAnyway we are to share one another's burdens\nOr in the book of acts you know we see a plan that you know we we've come together with our dollars we help each other we support each other in every way and that's what Samaritan ministries is it's a health care plan that it's designed by God for God's people\nAnd it is amazing ah my wife and I've been using it just over three years now um we said do well over well over twelve hundred dollars a month\nUm eat but I can tell you you're going to probably save\nYou know if you're really young you're going to save three hundred dollars if you're above thirty it's probably going to be closer to four or five hundred dollars and and onward and onward norm or do I mean the savings is is um amazing but more importantly you become a better Stewart of your family's health care\nAnd the I Love that and we get to use God's Plan for health care and it is an incredible system I mean just to get a check from somebody\nElse for need that we had it with a\nPrayer for you know I get a lot of coal I get I get jak sometimes are people that know no me obviously from the ministry and uh his grade and I just [noise] it is really an amazing system my [noise] my wife is a nurse for forty years she was very skeptical about\nYour your lifestyle in any way to great\nThank you know I'm Glad you share that with all of us let me go to Elaine and Elaine's calling us from Florida highly\nI might go in and out of ten thousand dollars to put away for her kids college she has three children of her and she doesn't know what to do with it\nHow how old's the oldest Fifteen okay she'll be sixteen and the youngest is nine\nOkay so she has to be careful because the money is going to start getting drawl drawing on 'em in three years for the oldest one of them say fifty three years maybe for\nShe she had her five twenty nine going already but she does okay yeah how long it takes you put it in there and not\nYeah so how long has she had the five Tony non play\nOh probably about five years but she doesn't have that much in your family are probably three thousand\nYeah I Would put it in that but the ... yeah I think that's probably had a I think that's probably the by I guess she has him for all three children divide them up a editor and put it into that that might be a better way to go\nOkay off though is that there could conquer silver bar\nNot not really um unless you absolutely need the money I mean I don't know what you paid for it but it's about fourteen dollars I'm right now and some ... some of them more than fourteen so um I Do believe\nAt some ... some of them more than fourteen so um I Do believe [noise]\n[noise] I I I hate to say this 'cause I don't want people going out really necessarily him and buying of it but I was saying anyway\nI mean I think that uh we're probably going to see a silver and gold both are in the next couple of years two to three two to four years start defined that old balance and maybe start to pick up a bit [noise]\nUm the silver or does the one thing about silver and has an industrial
