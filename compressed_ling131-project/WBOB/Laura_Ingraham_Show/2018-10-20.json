were just\nOkay so they're gorgeous and they're both custom built homes\nSell that's different than just you know going to add trap builder spelled and everything the same\nThey both are custom built so one was built by said heck I'm On them that's the one in equal landing and the other one was built by north Florida builders and that one and world golf ... yeah and these home has something else in common\nKnow Larry from the garden show yes he did gardens had both of their homes\nPretty cool yeah yes they're gorgeous I Can't wait or we're going to tell you about them at the end of the show we're\nDoing open houses they have this weekend yeah yeah but they're they're both spectacular yeah inside and outside [noise] yes absolutely\nAnd you know what I Love about accustomed bell home when you walk into it you just feel the quality you can feel it you know hearing something solid you know you can look at the architectural details and you just get really impressed you or like everywhere I look I see something else the owners\nAre special people too in both cases [noise]\nYeah absolutely [noise]\nThat they are they are hey you know we had a great week first one I Want to say hello to everyone happy October twentieth well wait a second are you going to give a shout out to new homeowners to our two new ... new home on her customers that were lifted their house you know the ones we're talking about\nSteven Sandy OK and dining county yeah yeah that's all right well how many October twenty it we had a great week we met some great people and saw some great houses we have to give some\nYet we had a great week we met some great people and saw some great houses we have to give some shout outs\nCarol Murphy I Want to say a big hello to Carol Murphy she's going to be listening to the show this morning I Want to say thank you to Carol and her late husband for so much great service\nTo our country now I don't want to give a details about that because Carole may have some privacy about that part of her or she and her husband\nLet's just say they did some great service to our couldn't do it and um ... let's just leave it at that she has a great home in the in March landing and she's going to be moving soon and I just want to say\nCongratulations to her and thank you for your service and also\nRita now Rita is in the bay meadows area and she's kind of waiting for a message from above should I Move now and go closer to my grandchildren and that's an interesting question\nAnd she and I had a discussion about that and I was thinking you know when grandchildren are really young\nYou have a really special connection with them and do you have that special connection with them when they become let's say late teens because I'm thinking when they get their driver's license\nDo they really want to spend time with grandma or do they want to go and be with their friends and I'm thinking when they get to that time when they have their driver's license and they don't want to spend that much time with grandma so I'm thinking and I don't know how old her grandchildren are\nAnd I forget what those plants are called but they\nThey're kinda tall and bushy and then they had these purple soft things at the top they're so beautiful and then that walkway goes around that\nAnd then after that even is the golf course\nReally it's just sort of this breathtaking kind of thing when you walk in the house and um\nAnd I started you don't see houses on either side no you don't it's completely private and the great thing is for people who golf at eagles landing they know that this is a dog leg to the left so they are not going to get any golf balls on this property at all\nNow I'm not a golfer some kind of had to explain that to me but still that's a great thing sell you know and the golf course that's raised a little too said there's all this privacy it's super awesome yeah we're going to remember out of it anyway [laughter] it's really\nIt really has to take it is truly an executive home state yeah yeah yeah yeah it's an orange jumpsuit an\nAmazing um and you know what there's probably I don't know I don't know the value because that really didn't ask\nBut I Would say there's probably fifty sixty thousand dollars worth of\nLandscape and ... I'm just talking about the yard I'm not talking about the pool and all that I'm Talking about the yard but the thing that I Love about it she's so brilliant and gardening that she indicated that it's real low maintenance\nSo you know like for me I kill everything so I was sort of looking at a get a share way and she said oh no it's so easy maintenance so she went through great\nEffort in her designs and implementing and you know what that's another thing that we have to give a shout out for serving our country because she was a commander her husband was the lieutenant commander retired now but they certainly did serve our country well they did yes\nThat was actually not out to vote for him yeah absolutely [laughter] All right hey I Want to talk about um foreclosures\nThat's a really down her thing right ... years ago we almost led the country and the number of foreclosure that's right and it's gone down down down down meaning somebody less of them so yeah we're doing fine but there was a um in fact for the last\nThirty six months through July the country has seen a decline in foreclosures\nNow but in in July it went up one percentage point not here and do I don't know\nDoesn't matter and that's kind of interesting though to wonder why it well it's gone down so much\nOver the last three years that if it just goes up a point from such a low point it's no big deal but something happened last month there was a foreclosure and it happened to be in I'm In Texas\nWhere one house broke a record for the highest price property that the bank actually went through the full foreclosure process and took it back from the homeowner and it was over a million dollars cash show the contest used to call in and guess\nWhat the price of the home was\nTo to to talk to me or I'd have to call\nThem gifts to to talk guess within a half a million dollars higher low I'd say with the Texas that mortgage was text size property yes All right yes\nMortgage ... was text size property yes All right yes okay what's really surprising honestly and\nIt was a gorgeous house no telling how long that was in foreclosure 'cause you know a lender and want to give up on a property like\nThat well the interesting part was that when they finally went through the foreclosure and got it back yeah it was instilled in stunning condition\nLived there all the way through foreclosure yeah\nHad it on the market to try and get it sold it didn't sell and then the people moved out when it finally you know trying to work it out with the bank and the bank said no no and they finally took it back and the people moved out but it is a new thing now been conditioned\nTo think about um how classy those people were right that they didn't destroy the property so many people get angry that they are losing their home and they destroyed the property yeah so I guess at the difference in price right yeah you know ...\nIt's it's interesting it's not just people that are are poor\nThat home goes ... go into ... it's not that at all there are people that just lost their jobs or sure the economy went bad or one of his spouse has passed away\nThose are the things that cost at all um but um but anyway this was a ... and we don't know the story behind this we only know that it was a big big beautiful expensive I saw some pictures of it it's like\nOh my oh my\nOh my ... for people to guess yeah what do you want 'em to gas the amount that the dollar amount that now they're out in the market for right now within what\nWithin a half a million dollars either\nWay high or low they way you know call now I Know for two two to eight to five five\nAnd it's not as much as the mega ball or the Powerball [laughter]\nSo getting back to that [laughter]\nI Know there's you get out slim possibility but I Am super lucky person I'm I think I'm going and when\nYou do if yeah OK\nThe contest or the mega mall or power Ben Powerball power all please [laughter] ... one point six\nMillion billion ... billion billion okay [noise] well\nYeah All right so what happened\nThis week here in real estate in northeast Florida Angela\nWell our and according to the multiple listing surveys\nThis past week for homes and condominiums six hundred and three offers got accepted and that's about the same as it was last week yeah almost exactly yeah seven hundred and Thirteen new homes came on the market and that's down eleven percent from the previous week\nA hundred and twenty two and the seven Thirteen [noise]\nThey are already under contract\nSo what is that about a Fifteen Percent\n... almost ...\nAlmost twenty thirty eight of those went under contract on the very first day and four hundred and Seventy three people closed on a home for their self and we say the last numbers up a little bit from the previous week how 'bout that yeah you know you said that\nUm the number that came on the market is down eleven percent yeah that\nHappens that is starting to happen this time of year the number of people that put their home on the market goes down there are fewer people that list their home in October November and December and there are fewer buyers generally in October November or December\nHowever however I Love your however here's the secret they most realtors do no most homeowners will really\nMost realtors don't notice okay the same percentage of homes sell every month of the year so if you think oh I'm going to take my home off the market 'cause it's a slower season\nYou don't need to you don't meet too because there's less competition\nThere are less buyers so that is the same probability that your house will sell whether it's November or December or June or July it doesn't matter now here's the good part\nBut because they are less people looking around there's going to be less people that are just going to be you don't have to fix up your house and keep it neat\nBut the people that are looking very serious buyers\nWhat did you just say about you don't have to keep your house up well there may not be twenty people that look at it before a buyer comes there may only be ten there may only be five but the people that are looking very serious I still need people to keep their house up [laughter]\nWell what I mean [laughter] they're going to ... you have to keep it nice but they um\nHere you're saying that would be less frequent shelling that's correct okay that's correct yeah but they're series buyers\nAnd they really are the most important part about keeping your house up it's making airbags making sure the kitchens claim\nThere you go to the bathroom to claim their that's it that's really what you have to do every day and break toilet seat down ladies by kitchens bathrooms just make them spotless and the other hand the rest of the house come to the bad doesn't address in the house that matter okay can overlook anything out\nFine I still want someone to call in and guess how many millions the most expensive foreclosed house [noise]\nAnd I will tell you that houses Fifteen thousand square feet [noise]\nHow we think about that Alan [noise] Fifteen thousand square feet [noise]\nYeah I was thinking how many are cleaning people does that tape I dunno [laughter] comes with an indoor pool and in the indoor pool area [noise] there's a theater [noise]\nDid you see recently in the news they were talking about that sellers are going to request that their photos taken down did you say that this who's going to require sellers when they sell their house that they're going to want their photos to be removed from the multiple listing service\nI had not heard that we know some agents do that when a new lens they're listing\nYes may lose their looked at him but the interesting thing is is most agents don't remember to go to the cello and pulled the pictures down or to ... dot com and pulled the pictures down did you know that so a lot of times you can still find the old pictures out on the Internet\nYeah I've also heard agents in our office and from that and in other offices say\nOh the market for a higher and properties is terrible nobody's buying houses that are prized five hundred thousand dollars or more I've heard them say that I well I Want to dispel some of that I just went on to the statistics part of the multiple listing service\nHaired year to date and I asked year two thousand Seventeen year to date this year two thousand Eighteen and I looked at house prices five hundred thousand\nDollars in over you know what it's up twenty four percent the number about that the number of sold properties\nMillion dollar properties up twenty four and a half percent property from seven fifty to a million up twenty four and a half percent so all these\nPeople are just pull things out of the air and say oh high priced properties they're dead you know what they're not\nThey're not that so you know you know what contributes to that\nThe stock market's been great so consumer spending is up and\nBaby boomers are aging out said they start retiring and they are cashing in all their stuff and they're buying their dream house their kids are gone now and they're getting their million dollar place on the river or the ocean or that whatever but\nThe realtors that are complaining that has some of these listings that aren't selling yes maybe they're not marketing to home properly\nWell that's true they included in marketing program like we do\n[noise] yeah so if you have a high and property that is not so and give us a call and we can help you by the way how is the price of properties how is that going well the median which is the middle\nPriced property that has sold between two thousand Seventeen and two thousand Eighteen it's gone up from two hundred and ten thousand

I Love that movie he was a great movie because the guy had been in the employment does uh-huh\nAnd his comment was he says it's the greatest view you can see is the smile on the face of a person finally getting a job and\nSo how many things do we benefit as a people because folks are working they have a job and when you have a lot of jobs and there's less\nThere's more supply of jobs than there is demand now some people get a chance to improve their job and that helps for everybody a\nBig deal and that as evidence right now by the quit rate which is all of a sudden going through the roof\nBecause you don't quit her job unless you've satisfied that one early at rice area I got not only a different one but probably much better on\nAnd we've been telling people now for about a year people if you're not getting anywhere in your job now is the time to quit\nWell look what happened all of a sudden the number of jobs open has now topped seven million where we have six million people who are available to work well there's still a lot of people on the sidelines the people who dropped out of the workforce\nAre coming back down but they're not coming back in on a big enough rate is kind of a\nBalancing act I guess I'd say between those people and bringing in more people but we do not need is people who skills we do not know about\nThese jobs that are open right now are not shoveling snow in Wisconsin and mowing lawns and Florida although there are some of each of those I'm sure that are open but we're talking about people in the tech industry talking above manufacturing jobs and so on we need skilled people in this country and therefore we not only need\nImmigration but we need very careful very well planned them thought out immigration but yet we're not producing them\nAnd yet they're still is always the need for leadership always but things have how many different times you have worked for someone who inspired you\nWhat are we to board ... production land labor capital an entrepreneur as we need innovative people Labour without someone to direct it is useless\nThat's the old big the hole and then fill it up but the next soul and\nSomeone who is managing a business who was doing it by the rating or harassing their employees doesn't understand motivation team work those kinds of things and that she was going to lose their employees that's who's going to have\nProblems with their employer will survive only during the worst of times they will not survive during the best of times in fact just see a lot of employers now that of reducing the standards for entry into their companies a lot of them are now Reed College education doesn't matter\nAnd some are even going so far as to say some occasional drug use is going to be tolerated on your application hopefully it'll stop\nAfter that but um that it's all happening wages are starting to rise the national media is telling us one of the biggest problems in the Trump economy as wages aren't rising\nWhat they do not factor in is that ten twelve Thirteen thousand people or they retire because they're turning over six of the right they're getting replaced with much younger people who will work for less money as bad as not being factored into the equation good morning George\nYeah good morning I'm I've been pushing for ... for years now the school board now the papal cleaning bill Bennett who was\nSecretary education [noise] that ah we have some situation we need to avoid like forty seven percent [noise] of\nThe [noise] the freshman [noise] in state supported schools fail the first year they should not be there and then not mature enough or they should they had a trade school and therefore [noise] frankly every student should go for [noise] a trade trade skill situation say eight ... ...\nShould go for a trade trade skill situation say eight times tenth grade starting with putting kids on maybe six weeks or\nIn each type of job they might walk in eighth grade kind of work study I kinda did that because my father was a multi craft supervisor time again his commission we rebuild houses on the weekend or all kinds of things [noise]\nAnd I came out with a [noise] I'm not bragging because my grades weren't that great but I came out with the highest starting salary at our anniversary because of that\nBecause I already had the work experience so whether you're going to continue in trades are going to college we should have trade school for ... for a commercial school every single child and one other thing it does\nIs let the kids see what the real world like early on before they get thoroughly brainwashed\nHas been going on a long time for my wife was a teacher in the seventies and some of the kids that were coming into the public schools at that point\nHad very little concept of things like what time day it is that there is a dark time and time to class and those sort of fundamental skills if you're an employer and they've got a lot or so after that you're right don't look at all the things we used to well the ...\nThe Philippines graduate nurses before or twelfth grade or as they're finishing up a Germany is has kept trade school in the middle ages and Singapore has some of the best schools in the world but if it's because\nThe the parents are highly involved in what the kids do and and uh they do have the trade schools type situation also\nGerman has been a leader in that sense I can remember\nGeorge I would suggest you just hit a very important point\nUm there is a responsibility of parents to provide some direction some expectations but also the motivation\nI knew from very early then I was expected to go to college with my father got me a job after my senior year of high school for the summer working in a strip mine now that was the highest paying job I could have gotten in the Keystone heights area it also was probably the hardest job I had\nAn eye metal number of laborers and I realized very quickly I'm going to enjoy having this amount of additional money now but I sure don't want to do this for the rest of my life I better try to get some great going to go it's absolutely\nIt it puts responsibility and thinking about the future and the kid's head instead of memorizing a lot of silliness that they're not gonna ever use and by the time it's nice to have kept great comes around they ought to have to trade and they ought to have a license for it and then you leave if you keep the money\nFor eleventh and twelfth the the pre college or to change trades if you're a buggy whip manufacturers [laughter] thing for it goes out of business where you need to come up with a on a newer trade I push the for the school board and they moved a little bit\nBut we need everybody in town is listening

IRS and they said they won't have many people there until the first year they won't hire as many people\nAnd here's the question ah I'm retired now let me go back to work but I\nDon't have a job right now so officially I Can't put money into a raw and I want to take all of the pension money put it in the rough and\nI understand that is a six thousand five hundred dollar a year a spouse or a rough

obviously did and as most of us would say that their culture is not that way than you would do exactly that\nWell and I mean I worked at Wells Fargo was a great place to work they did a few things that cause them to lose and now they're having to reinvent themselves\nYou know as I was no different than in people who are practitioners in the financial field who take commissions the at Wells Fargo they were being incentivized by what was essentially a commission plan\nWhen a commission stands between you and your customer\nYou can't be sure which side that you are going to take your

over and over again for the last seven years I Am so grateful if he just stumbled upon yet yesterday and so grateful thank you for joining us again but if he isn't the first time that you have joined the show let me tell you I've been waiting for you\nThis show is about being a friend and having a safe place and you can go to and it is my commitment to provide alternative ways to heal and it is my mission to make awareness responsibility and truth a part of our everyday life\nAnd I hope you are listening as well as my viewing friends will feel empowered to break the truth and live the life of your dream now\nToday we're going to be getting a book called I hear\nYou and let me tell you when I first started thinking about OK validation okay how important is validation it turns out it's very important and so today we're going to be giving away a book the book called I hear you by Michael ...\nSorenson and you can find Michael at Michael at\n... dot com but for now let me just\nSet it all up now\nTo people will listen to the same thing but hear something totally different people need to be heard\nAnd we'll find out what's the difference between someone hearing you in someone listening to you that today we have\nReader researcher\nPersonal development junkie Michael Sorenson he's the author of I hear you and he's going to share the secrets of listening that will change the way we approached a relationship\nWith you but around the globe and since that is our sole purpose in life to give and receive loving knowledge I Am so grateful that Michael has joined us today to do just that welcome Michael to the Lillian McDermott radio show\nThings rather than yes thank you so much so she would have been about yourself and why you wrote this book\nAbsolutely you know it's funny I'm a I'm a pretty ordinary guy from being honest a lot of people when I publish the books at all but how fantastic I bet you always wanted to be an author I bet you you just always wanted to write something and I laugh and I say no I never aspires to be an awkward never aspired to write a book\nOr how I got here is actually a number of years ago I started seeing a therapist or to get some help working through a number of issues in my life mhm man\nAnd all they needed validation and they can put their wall down if they come to you and there I'm frustrated because of the project at work that you can listen to them understand why they're frustrated and show them that by validating them that help them feel better and even if they're excited about something and they come to you know you might just say oh that's cool\nYou know it kind of leave it there not to let down right they want you to go oh that's amazing gradually you know it's hard on that exactly right so so that in a nutshell validation then and I have had dozens of stories we can get into some of them here if you want but it it makes a huge difference in every aspect of life\nYeah I Love the story in your book I still want to hone in my I'm about how and why we should validate especially when we want to say okay I Will I Will give you a little tense about myself I'm a fixture\nI hear things and I'm already fixing 'em and so to me the way I think I could be helpful at time not all the time sometimes that can download eight in the proper way\nIt's like saying well daddy started this immediately offering results to because that's my strength to solve problems on the problem solver hey who knew so here I Am trying to help them but that is the strategy games but I learned in the book\nAbsolutely absolutely and that ... there's not a lot of research around validation that I've been able to find but there are a handful of studies one of them that really stood out to me is there a handful of researchers some sought out to try to prove you know physiological you if you will the importance of validation\nAnd what they did is they had a number of participants come into the lab and I asked them to do a series of math problems you know basic math got more difficult until that happened to a handful that were pretty tough and then they would take a break and they would bring the researchers at him and they would stand there and they would ask how they did\nAnd then you know a lot of times the participants would say well that was tough I don't know like I haven't done this in a while\nAnd they would respond in one of two ways the first would be invalidated saying well it shouldn't be that hard or a ... no one else has complained you never really you should just study you should just get better right give that advice like you're talking about yeah or they would validate that they would say that these are these are tough problems yeah they're hard yeah you know\nAnd what they sounded as they did this they were measuring the heart rate\nThey're measuring ... skin conducting levels which measure stress and then they would ask how they're feeling and what they found is when they invalidated the people when they give them advice or tried to say I don't worry about it or\nG. there shouldn't be that hard people's heart rates elevated\nPeople's skin conducting level do they mean and they were sweating more and they reported feeling even more uncomfortable yeah in contrast when they were validated by didn't give them any help they just said that it's really tough yeah these are hard problems\nPeople's heart rates went down people's skin conducting levels went down and they record it being much more comfortable and much more confident in their ability to fix the problem\nTank and they get and I love I Love learning about validation\nI'm In your book high here he said he was like to be the fifth color forecaster for seven three seven three five nine five nine okay so as I'm listening to you and I'm hearing in and I went up to date and acknowledge everything you're saying and the other part of me says okay well\nThe thing is and you're just in a pity party get over it\nAnd so let's talk about the difference between being helpful\nAnd agreeing or okay let's talk about the difference between disagreeing with what's happening and still being validating\nI I Love that you bring that up because that's one of the number one or misconceptions people have about ... right so the here about and I go I don't want to agree with someone you know what ... what if someone comes to me and they're all upset about their spouse\nAnd I know that they're in their own right then what am I I don't want to agree with them donation is not agreeing with them ... there's a saying I I understand where you're coming from I understand how you're feeling and while you feel that way\nThat's different from saying I agree with you know and and and I'll give you an example I'm at work I had a coworker who who came in he and I uh have had literally one to two hour long conversations when he gets upset when he gets frustrated about something we literally talk\nFor two hours because we'd go in circles and and if I don't agree with him as I often don't you know it's easy for me to say don't worry about it and I got this covered so this particular co worker came into my office one morning and I had just assigned a project to another coworker and he comes in and he says Michael I'm concerned because I don't think this guy is qualified for that work but you get them\nAnd I immediately jumped in and said hey don't worry about it I've got it covered I Know what I'm doing\nNothing about it right in saying should feel the way you're feeling because I didn't agree with them mhm what happened next though is to just shut right back yeah but there are a lotta and he starts going and then of course I push back and say hey I got this cup and\nAnd after a couple of minutes I realized oh here we go this is another five or another to our conversation and then I remembered validation I thought OK on approaching this wrong there is a better way to do is let me let me dominate him so I took a second and I I I put myself in his shoes right and I said okay actually this doesn't make sense why he's frustrated he doesn't have the whole picture\nAnd so I told him that I said I said you know what\nI actually I I can appreciate while you're frustrated right from you\nHoping that I said I said you know what\nI actually I I can appreciate why you're frustrated right from your perspective all you see as me but in this guy in charge you like as qualified and you're worried that it's going to affect our brand you worry that it's going to this and this\nAnd what happened next blew me away you laid back and go Oh yes that's exactly it and then he just wait and I am about well the first time that he seems to seems to have ... now\nAnd then I said may I share my side of the story you know I I think maybe you're missing a few things you can I share my perspective\nAnd he said yeah and then I was able to share with him why it had to find that person that project why was confident with water and work out and live within Fifteen minutes away and he he got a smile on to say it could make you so much for listening and talking about my office it was incredible to see how I could validate somebody even if I didn't agree with them\nNot only can you you must because it allows them to hear your side of the story it allows them to put their walls down and accept your feedback in your advice if they want it\nAnd I love it and it's so it's like if you think a bomb if it's the ability to defuse the bond so let's talk about some of the the different appropriate response is\nThat we can use as a validating listener or a listener with perfect and and you know there's a part of me and I'm going to be honest with you there's a part of me that feels that some of this nebulous there but at the other the other sense 'cause I Want to be\nGenuine we you know in order for it to come as delegation has to be January so let's talk about some of the appropriate response that that would be considered quote unquote validating\nSure well first off I loved that you brought up the manipulation concern because I've I have stopped that other people have mentioned that well isn't this just manipulating the person yeah absolutely not nomination falls flat if you aren't connected to the person so in the book I say the very first thing you have to have an empathy\nThat you you must connect with the person so a sympathy right as saying basically oh you poor thing like I'm On the outside looking at you oh that must be so hard that is not validating in fact that that to me this makes my skin crawl and I'm like I don't pay for it I mean you know yeah though is how\nI feel that you're feeling right and and and you have to connect with the person some first you have to truly understand where they're coming from\nMan you can validate them and so it's not manipulative at that point because you have to understand how they're feeling and when you do then you can truly awful validation then they feel that you appreciate them and and that's where the connection happens that's where the walls come down because they recognize that you care about them not that you're just\nTrying to placate them or make them feel better secretive I went through our\nYeah so I intention must be pure when we validate we must really be in a bright intention which is to connect with the individual whether you agree or disagree which is something that you're bringing out on the book in the book I hear you on that made me understand\nThat there is a higher level of honoring another person without having to agree with that so let's talk about some of the appropriate response says that you used in the book that\nAre really get that I used to some of the time that all the time\nSure so I I again I mentioned earlier the domination isn't just for negative emotions right you don't you can only use validation when someone's frustrated or upset but if they do you know someone comes to you and they are upset validating responses can look like\nYou know you you might say oh my gosh that's so frustrating mhm oh that must be so difficult you know I'm I mentioned in the bucket very basic framework about nation and I'd say about it in response ah one identifies an emotion into offers justification for that\nSo what that looks like is you know\nOf course understanding their situation so Lillian again to go back here maybe you're frustrated with something with a co worker you say oh my gosh I Believe that this happened so and stuff that is to me ... ... if I'm next to you and I'm just as frustrated as you I can say that right oh my gosh I Can't believe he said\nThat simple sentence is validated because it shows people [noise] so he's frustrated too I'm not crazy\nThey get they get in with\nThe calling for seven three seven three five nine five nine states color attack struggle when the book I hear you there still in off year relationship and we had a conversation with Michael sorry thing when we return white it when you think will be writing away [noise]\nBasic structure because it really isn't a science you know there's really no right or wrong way to know\nYou can go through that whole thing in an hour and a half conversation multiple times or you can go through those forceps and thirty seconds right if you're talking to me and and you go and I and I said who each other that's amazing that is so cool I'd I've listened of connected to you know what your family your\nThat's that's amazing that is so cool I I've listen I was connected to you know what you're feeling you're excited I'm excited with your son validating that it's not appropriate for me to offer advice and when we're done with the conversation I say oh my gosh congratulations again that is so cool\nThat's valid expect it can be very basic but that that framework I have found is giving people a basic idea nice direction on how to how to how to connect better with people\nVery good okay so here's the deal\nI understand the stats understand the concept that the stats but how do we become aware\nThat we're not using the steps\nHow do we stop when I think people you think Europe's that let me tell you about my coworker look what he did to me today how do we stop the why not being how do we stop predicting which I'm like really guilty about that uh and so how do we stop ourselves so that we can train ourselves to be better listeners\nSo I Will say I'm the same way lily and I'm definitely identify their sticks or [laughter] you know I I wrote a book on the topic do you think I Would be perfect at it but literally just the other night I was talking with my girlfriend\nAnd she was going through a tough time and I jumped right into giving her advice right and I was like oh that's a ... you should do this you should do that\nAnd I made sure\nThey know shutting right and so to answer your question how do you know when you're not doing it well you're pretty quickly she got defensive yeah I mean she's like well I did that but there are a lot and of course I give her more advice because you get the fences again oh oh\nI haven't gone anywhere she didn't want my advice she just wanted me to to appreciate how she was feeling antitrust these steps back and I said I said you know I'm Sorry I didn't mean you know marched into advice here um tell me more right and she started talking again and then I was able to listen and go\nOh of course you feeling embarrassed she feeling whatever right and then I was able to or they are so I find that people want validation any time they're sharing something worth you\nKnow they're coming to you with a great story if they're coming through with a problem if they're coming through with any kind of feeling they're wanting their wanting validation tricky thing is most people don't know that\nMost people don't know about what they're wanting all they know is if you try to fix them that you showed all over them they get defensive and they don't know why but I have found but it's actually because they wanted delegation\nMhm yes yes absolutely so validation one oh one you cover in the book as a matter of fact you have a chapter called validation one oh one should be the fifth call or text or for oh seven three seven three five nine five nine and when a copy of this extraordinary book that will help you build\nIn an improve your relationship okay so then you talked about empathy\nSo I'm so there's the empathy part is to that connection understanding even if you don't agree with the situation\nHow do you\nGet to that place where you go on so sorry I understand [laughter] which is not what you mean like I get it I get how you feel this way advertising is different than the ... the baby so let's let's go with the empathy that that train ourselves to be empathic not a sympathetic\nAbsolutely well and I think you know as you're talking a good experience that illustrates this was actually the very first experience that you know how to get me off on a learning about this the first day or so to church or first chapter my book so I had just started learning about validation I just started on ...\n... and I met this girl I don't remember where it where I met her um she was probably she was friendly she was outgoing I Love to take this woman on a date ...\nNext weekend I just figured I keep a casual you know I say let's go ...\nAnd rocket corrupt and we're driving over there and ah and she\nIsn't very open you know we're we're not really connecting to keep looking at the clock so you know give me one way or the answers and I'm like what is it like that but I must read this like a C not interested in it must be missing something here and it got to the point where actually like Fifteen minutes I was about ready to take her home because I thought she was clearly not interested I clearly must read something here\nAnd so we were driving back and uh I asked her a question about her family and she paused than indicated it sensitive subject and that's what I thought\nOh I I might have missed something to do this might be it and she said all my parents were in the middle of a divorce and I pause and I thought that what's going on here mhm and my parents have not been divorced and my parents are divorced so I I didn't understand or they couldn't empathy right there\nBut I told her that I just said oh my gosh I'm so sorry to say it's okay it's fine right and she was accused bracing for advice or feedback and I just said not fight that's got to be incredibly difficult\nShe said yeah it actually really socks and she started going in talking about and she opened up as I as I refrain from validating or they just said you know I don't understand\nBut I just let her steel big completely changed our dynamic and we ended up talking for an hour hour and a half in my car\nShe had been invalidated from people in her life so many people said well you should just tough it out you just put a smile on your face you got to be strong ... what I Want to feel you know that's not what I hear what she was telling me and that validation with like water you know she was starved for it\nAnd that was one of the first things that made me realize oh my gosh I I wrote my journal that night\nI felt so much more connected to her I could tell that she thought connected me simply because I was just trying to empathize with her a respected how she was\nFeeling [noise] you know my shoulders and that's a great that's how you start the book and I and everyone there I'm reading about that the first time I've heard about your son and I thought you know I\nWe have missed out with social media was all the different kind of salt connections that we made\nThat I'm really just need this reminder so I'm Wondering if knowledge you Michael for taking the time to write your thoughts down because it's so important for all of a

Augustine or ... million highlands Fleming island Daytona the villages up and down I Ninety five\nWelcome back all of you to this production of the lighthouse retirement our for Saturday morning October twenty or twenty Eighteen\nWell I have an absolutely huge show for you today and it's largely a list of I told you says from last week's show it's a long list of I told you show told you so it was\nOn last week's show last week in some of you Aaron Lee got a rerun despite the fact that the correct show was on the website ... castle is correct but\nFor some reason the station didn't get the data sorry for that I Wish you had heard it ... it was a powerful show some say it was a loud boisterous yelling screaming show and it was all of that and it was for two reasons\nOne is that sometimes\nWhen I see really stupid stuff\nLike last week's algorithmic crash that's back went back on Wednesday and Thursday when one starts sold off for no reason at all except that there was a rumor of marginally higher interest rates and accelerating trade wars with China\nThat cost you all a lot of money I get really angry I get really upset I get really mad when I see a big mouth Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell who really should be I don't know like wallpaper silent in the background taking no notice of it\nOnce the Chinese or humiliated though if you if you if you go too far and you don't walk it back which is what they tried to do last week by bringing out Larry Kudlow statement agents right after they yanked out Peter Navarro\nRight if you humiliate the Chinatowns you get their backs up against the wall\nThey have a lot of levers that they can pull that will hurt America so I'm not buying our boss and not doing business to to shutting down businesses to competing with our our with our other adversaries like Russia\nSooner this damn thing is over the better is all I have to say as I produce a show on friday morning\nReports are out from the south China Morning post how many have you read the south China Morning post how many even knew that there was a warning post in South China doesn't you know it's a newspaper\nSouth China Morning Post that in fact the two presidents Z and Trump indeed are scheduled to meet at the G twenty in Buenos\nAires\nOn November thirtieth so it's gone from being\nA rumor is to not being rumored to back to being room to being nearly confirmed\nMy guess is the two are going to talk the two are going to talk\nAnd so you're looking at a possibility that I don't know what is it the forty days from now\nYou could have President Trump for president as you say I don't know we're we've made progress if you if you have ... President Trump and president as you say we've made some progress you could see the stock market rally another thousand points of being bought a boom\nThat fast that fast\nBut you got to decide you got to talk to your own advisor Derek scissors a resident scholar at the Americans don't have to ask me asked Derek scissors a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute of Washington based conservative\nThink tank with close ties to Donald Trump said Trump and Xi\nQuote are going to have a meeting unless something happens that something happening is the president loses the house unless something happens to us and China are quote are trying to have a framework coming out of the meeting\nWithout saying where he got his information\nHe said he did not know how comprehensive the framework would be but a short term deal could be finalized in months which is exactly because I've already written part too I wrote part to Thursday nights I edited this park friday morning that's exactly what I tell you in part to\nHi I edited this part friday morning that's exactly what I tell you in part two of today show\nWe're talking weeks and I\nA couple of months good good times are here you got a hold is you've got a hold the house\nI don't think the u._s. could credibly promise he says that we will not take any action against China before the election\nReferring to possible changes before the mid term I don't think anyone would believe that and so already in this show you have more news that you can use that you're likely to get all the way from your advisor from the

that'd be good too and then you'll know all about it you don't have to listen to the free of the Internet for the rest of the world as I wrote this show on Thursday\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd for those reasons I Believe that last week's crash was algorithmic I told you it was mechanical not fundamental and we got news this week evidence this week by the earnings that it was not fundamental\nWe saw what was sold off we saw what got bought back first so it wasn't fundamental it was mechanical was algorithm it hit as it was it was ... you got to remember that\nThese Eighteen apps were created largely by these on line discount brokers they can't make any money any other way so they created these E. T. S. they sold them to you on the pretense that they're cheap and and good\nBut they're also tools that they and other people like them used\nTo create these algorithmic trades the stock market crashes that scare you and panicky when to sell a perfectly good stocks so that they can buy them back up at lower prices and you're standing around with your finger up your ear going what just happened\nWhere a stock market crash was dancers and then friday Monday and Tuesday or seven or eight hundred and far away then\nHey you guys keep buying those ATF from the from the discount broker from the vanguard from the fatalities from the eyes shares in the black rocks you keep buying a new chief enabling your worst nightmare\nAnd I'm going to explain that to you I'm part two of the show like nobody else does because I get money and they don't get money\nYou had a choice to prepare for this week based on what I shared with you last weekend or you could have waited for the silence from your current advisor to break you could have waited for the left to boot Becky ... quick to ask the same question that she asked John Bolton four days after I already told it to you on the radio\nAnd those reasons my friends are why this from is so dead gum special\nI think about this stuff before most others do\nBefore you heard it on Fox News I may have already relayed a lot of it's our clients and my morning commentary and my other messages to my clients and I've discussed it in the annual review that we've been having with them that we've been having for the last three or four weeks old I'm exhausted\nWhat they said oh the vanguard teeny what did they tell you about the meeting of the two presidents in November my guess is nothing my guess as I said hey by more mutual funds by more hope for more money and ATS\nI'd be surprised that after you meet with me personally you're not going to agree that it was the best time you've invested in your retirement ever\n[noise] you don't have to say you don't have to you know just because your money is that one of these firms doesn't mean you have to stay there it doesn't it just because one of these guys might be your friend from church they don't even have\nTo know you're leaving it happens electronically I just in the piece of paper through in the money move from one broker to the other that's it bummed out and bought a bank you don't have\nTo stay there just because you have an account infidelity or vanguard of Wells Fargo PNC doesn't mean it has to stay there I can have that thing out of there and two days painless\nAnd you don't have to sell anything I don't know if you guys know that maybe don't know that you don't have to sell any of that stuff if you have\nFive or ten mutual funds in it now and you want to just switch 'em right over Bones Are switched and then we'll look at him and tell you what we think you should do with them keep them sell them get rid of him whatever\nLarry fink with Larry think\nThat kids that kids grade school years must have been rough Larry fink of black rock made two very important points this week while he was being interviewed after the after his companies' earnings report the first\nThing that he said there's very insightful no we already knew it was that Americans and that means you unfortunately that means you guys listen well maybe not you guys on the radio 'cause you guys are probably smarter than most of the public right ... a lot of the public is out there still\nListen to the vitamin commercial on the other channel or they're out there at home depot doing whatever they do but you guys have invested time in your life your ear you've invested your time and listening to a really smart money show so probably there's an exception for you\nBut he says Larry fink a black rocks as the first mistake first thing is wrong with American economic system is that most Americans do not say nearly enough for retirement that's\nTrue it's a known fact Larry think is the or see a black rock and he gets paid\nTo re site common knowledge\nA potential client came in the same as weak in his late fifties\nFirst words out of his mouth were I Want to talk about my retirement [laughter] just looked at him and I looked at his wife guys got two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the bank and I turned it in right in front of his wife and I said that you need to be talking to me about retirement do not use the R word in front of me\nUntil your portfolio starts with a number of sign and then one million dollars when you have one million dollars in the bank you can start talking to me about a modest retirement but until then don't use the R word in front of me\nAnd I are met but until then don't use the R word in front of me at fifty fifty five sixty years old I'm sixty six I feel like right now I could do this or another Twenty years and still be great I honest to God I feel that good\nKnock on wood thanks to the good genes\nMost Americans are clueless according to Larry think and I agree when it comes to understanding how much money they are going to need for retirement how to get that money how to spend that money\nAnd somehow this damned mutual fund industry this on line discount brokerage industry has convinced you\nThat you should be able to figure this out on line that it's a new it yourself projects like something on home and garden TV the number one network\n\nWhat I Do is not a home and garden project it is not a do it yourself project\nJust not\nAnd you got to be honest with yourself and say I don't know what I don't know there might be things out there I don't know\nSecond biggest problem says Larry think to America's retirement system\nAnd I know where Larry's going with this I told you been a listener to this show for the nearly ten or eleven years has been on I've already told you were Larry fink and black rock\nWant to go I've already told you where they want to go oh Canada\nRight I already know were Larry fink wants to take that business if you think I don't know what Larry fink business plan as I Know what Larry things business\nPlan is\nLarry thanks business plan is to suck up to the government\nAnd convinced the government now you're too stupid to manage your own money in your own four one K. but rather than having an increase in Social Security contributions year need to be forced to buy a bunch of lifetime income products call those annuities that his company wants to sell you\nHave the government forced you to make those purchases that sort of Larry think's going that's where I think the things going\nI might be wrong but I'd wager I'm right\nSo Larry ... says the second biggest problem with the U.S financial industry has your financial literacy is bad he thinks he can go to the government and say look those people listen to those people that are mindlessly dripping money the only reason that they're even surviving is because of these horrible target date funds that we created for them\n\n... God Forbid we had let them by individual stocks these Americans are so stupid they're so financially illiterate they what they would have invested in bad stocks thank God we put them in mutual funds and ATF and therefore thank God you and me and the government\nForce them into four one K. plant thank God the government wouldn't let them by Apple Facebook Amazon and Google\nWhich are harder and life's work\nThank God we put them in a bunch of target date funds earning virtually nothing\n\nAnd then the government's gonna turn around the Larry fink at black rock and fidelity in vanguard and American Funds that are going to say hey thanks for all of them damn political contributions to our party and you are right my friend Americans too stupid to manage their money what America needs as an annuity retirement\nJust exactly like that one in Canada and exactly like that one in Australia and exactly like that one in Shanghai\nAnd then Larry faced in ... no no they don't even like that what they need is one where black rock fidelity Lincoln Hartford\nVanguard potential they can all make a piece of they cannot get a therapy so they want it to be privatized so that they can get a piece of your retirement pie\nThat's what Larry think of black rock I think things have you but you don't have to believe me you don't have to believe me because a client comes in to see me this week", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "20"}
