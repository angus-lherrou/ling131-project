economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like in this midterm election cycle with\nThe Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the ... he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nIn twenty sixteen to turn out our boat to educate voters to talk about the results I there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with Mike Brown I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we can definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in mid term of a first term president so I felt good about where we are Kavanaugh\nHas definitely energized our base and I'm seeing that in our mail I'm seeing it in our fundraising all across the board it has put a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are
