independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters are said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who supports curbing immigration levels\nThat's a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the levels should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter of what we allow in legally now\n\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that makes it a ... a majority at least fifty percent or they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally

good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get you coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management\nAnd I had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need to help coal trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified towns were\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nCould he will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late fees and over limit charges and reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors of being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nMake certain our border is secure I encourage Mexico to make certain that they're border is secure into the air protecting their sovereignty will cause this is not something that you know people entering by force\nIs not something that we should view as being an acceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo the poems whose first do this you know big numbers are very Persian way of looking at the world Babe Ruth burger that are hard to tell people that were was I'm not\nSure if you want to move things forward makes compromise is trying to do for immigration here all these big issues with one of them would be really sure people were more\nSo we had eight years of Obama motivated they mess of our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what does he talking about\nLike well you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from a liberal when it they don't want to stand on constitutional principles\nAnd we hear it over and over I have one of the most she bipartisan record of accomplishment of anyone in the house and I continue to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\n... freedom hope an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty\nAnd protecting our borders securing the southern border\nOr is it in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one filed for them\nThey're legal aliens team they tend to see a haven for illegal aliens in our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but it's a difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them does certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen would be somebody there at the border welcoming dental giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so I'd say let's stand firm on this end to what to make certain that these caravans now they cannot just come walking and our country and receiving benefits\nTennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human drive tractors and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there uh again demanding services go off and getting paid in cash\nAnd this undermines us a worker or of all backgrounds legal immigration legal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop\nA congresswoman Blackburn what what would you ah in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about this there's no reason this mobile mobs should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall [noise]\nWell you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation\nHas passed twice in the house but we couldn't get to the Senate to take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people that said is and executive Menlo program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it daily and go with those issues funding the wall I Am a show for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing the southern border you know large realized walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel wrong work\nAnd what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country that are not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I met with say an angel on the other day and the Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens\nWho had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien went back to Mexico and this is not ...\nIt's it's not right and for these families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do eat verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West and she I talked to a guy who has a\nA brick and mortar bait a business and\nAnd he was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under the bed by those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nKnow totally out of hand\nAnd then he and his sons go in\nAnd do it right but he said you know these big jobs for he and his sons to keep their Mason growing business in in gear to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and why I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured every child is a border town every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police\nHas endorsed to me and my son ... crime tough on trafficking truck on tough on the drug issue the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue they see it as an issue that affects them and their community and to law enforcement

want to cure a question of You're welcome to do it\nA four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three and you can choose your question up that she had like um to get that answered and we'll get that to you by the way I was just going to tell you about some update but Netflix\nSo you think of well there's not a lot of bonds out there or prefer is I don't know how they're issuing this and what type what form yet but they're issuing two billion dollars\nWorth of a bond or it is says you're a bond offering their offering a bond offering ... billion dollars worth of bond offerings uh let's see if they're having a coupon rates here they don't uh so we'll see what that looks like a not a bond or whatever by a Netflix is the last\nUm thing I Would buy but I'll just tell you this\nIt's three ticks a way it's being issued three takes away from being junk\nBut in this field is so so competitive\nThat nobody has a lock on it nobody has a lock on the success or seeing mergers and acquisitions Disney and Fox Studios 'em or you know are just one we don't know what's gonna happen with Time Warner now you've got um\nOh I Can't think of the big movie company begins with a pie that's terrible\nHow ... ...\n... ... is\nParamount is is a now got a on demand kind of channel and that is growing and they've got an enormous amount of content so on and on a goes there's lots of competition every body is trying to get a piece of this cut your cable market\nSo uh you know it's I'm just throwing it out there so when your broker calls you and says hey we got some great bonds here I just want to tell you from a from a ... perspective from a highly rated\nBond they're not very so just say\nI mean it it would fall and the risk risky category there so just be careful that I wanted to throw that out to you by the way\nAll the indices they really haven't moved the author lows they're also offer highs they opened up very positive right now the Dallas down a quarter less than a quarter of one percent\nThen as that goes up three quarters of a percent so technology stock seem a little bit of a run and the as somebody is flat\nSo that's where we are right now will watch that on this October twenty second [noise] a couple\nOf things that I Want to point out to you I Know a lot of you're just joining us here for this third our but let me just point out that we've got some economic data coming out this week some of it pretty important some of it not so important but durable good numbers coming out this week that's a very important number that's when we want to watch closely\nKeep in mind that we had a door but good orders\nLast month ... that was a very good kind of off the charts so you know it's not likely that we're going to see that same kind of movement\nNow but certainly ah we we do have\nA durable good numbers we had a four point four percent last look on durable goods that was an August number\nSo\nI don't think September is going to be that that kind of number also the other thing is that we want to watch is home sales were getting new home sales coming out so home sales new home sales or we should see those numbers they're coming out right now we're hoping\nFor a good number doesn't look real good doesn't look like it's going to be a setting the world on fire that is for sure when it comes to new home sales so we'll we'll see where we end up\nThe big number coming out of friday friday we get a uh we\nProbably would I mean I ... and right now I Would get it I Would I Would probably stop the rider and get out when you can get out when you're getting out of surrender charges or getting close to being out of surrender charges or I Would I Would look again now\nThe other question was the uh I had over ten thousand you prefer so I'm pretty pretty well less than ... prefers but the ... been recommend to the like the caller is warning about going into prefers in the right now they're they're three to four dollars below par and I was just wondering uh that should be an incentive shouldn't it\nOr yeah it is it is it is it is an incentive no no no it is critical I mean it isn't a set of uh but here's the here's the risk if there is a risk I mean it's if you're like if it's like you wear and so many others that are in it for the income then there is no risk\nBut the real the real risk is that it doesn't get called for many many more years\nBut uh I wouldn't let that risk keep me if you really need the income and his situation because of his age and such um there was probably not the right thing to do right now I didn't think he was going to get out of that is a four one K. any way to do that but um\nI I yeah I mean that's a huge benefit that or this much below par and uh you know if you're going to get in now is a good time to do it and I think\nHe's getting a little bit of a bump today but I think they're going to continue to be um you know on the on the low side below par or for a while\nYeah pong time yeah yeah ... come back down which might not happen for many many years right\nExactly so there's no incentive for these companies to call it\nBecomes yeah why would I call it if I can last they just want to get out of debt so\nThere are there are companies that are going to say you know what we're doing really well things are going great we've had a good run let's get out of debt let's lower our art let's increase our free cash flow they call it\nAnd get out of debt and ... and pay it off so they can easily do that I've seen that happen before [noise] um I had a demeaning the energy\nUm preferred in in my IRA that went out of leather years pass a cold day I think we're ever going to call they call it a couple of years ago but it was a pain about eight percent\nSo you know I didn't care if they ever I was hoping they'd never call\nBut they did but it was primarily because they needed to shift some things around because of the buyout that they made some of the problems they had with their nuclear power stuff or some years ago they they needed to free up that money but we made it off but nonetheless [laughter] yeah\nI have a I haven't read it counts and has a couple of those are the present it and it may not have the the the uh the time horizon that he's you know request a if I have an opportunity to get out of the the ... are on the positive side would you recommend that getting out of that\nIs a is an ear to calculate the may not have that calmer as honest you request yeah you'll be yeah I mean it's not getting out of that\nIf only only if you can get out positive yes yeah if you can get a positive I Would do it just make sure she asked that your broker doesn't take the order and say okay and then ... without calling you to let you know what the business\nI never had that happened with the the marriage rate or our country and I never had them call back when I put order it for so long preferred by never had that situation happened\nDo well maybe they've gotten you know they've always been a case where they've sold at whatever it is you were looking at that day the market or how you and then they have no reason to cough that's the case but sometimes they won't call even if they get a bit lower um apologize\nLast last week for my derogatory comment about the\nNews now I Know you were under the table and do a lot worse than I Am just for a NATO or better yet\nRight All right Jeff by a push by the facts recalls alright sealer by a a former for seven or seven fifty five thirty three let me go to a Sondra from Arkansas\nThey sound to you when I got to put you on the air there you go go ahead\nOkay I can talk to you know talk to you about my annuity said I had in one company and you had asked\nA given me a suggestion that I might try Jamie it marriage right uh-huh which I which they are trying to just start starting with them but\nThey may be a great ... and you know I don't know a whole lot about it and I don't know what to do and I was wondering if you had any suggestions shell\nAnd I was wondering if you had any suggestions\nShow they are they trying to are you going back into an annuity with them you\n\nKnow you did a ten thirty five exchange yeah okay\nSo you are you're staying within the annuities because of what surrender charges or whatever the situation was I don't\nKnow yet to paint that yes I Am retired I'm not start taking money out because I don't have to you I'm sure I'll be sixty nine next month\nOr so is it it's not a higher re annuity heard just a deferred annuity [noise] um yeah I I mean if if I had to pick one I guess you know the biblical responsible\nI could say that much about him great what it is that that is that the one you\nScrape standstill you want me to pick out several different ones so I don't I don't know anything about it never had a thing that financial advisor just picked for me\nYeah well they um the the marriage rate guys aren't on commission\nSo they're not incentivized to push one over another one which is a good thing [noise] um well I mean I I guess you you have to tell him or her that it's you know you don't want any volatility and you want the lowest risk\nYou know you want to get some income with the lowest risk you're going to have so just to make sure that um you know you don't want to go into a variable or an indexed annuity at this point you you're if you're getting ready and the next five years for retirement\nThan um you know you you don't want to do to where you need that money you don't want to take a lot of risk I Would take a preservation of principle mindset and that's the way you should tell\n[noise] conservation principle mindset\nYeah you want to be you want to preserve what you have you don't want to take a lot of risk that's what you want to tell [noise]\n[noise] oh okay [noise] oh yeah she was asking about mid cap large yeah different things like that and I'm like well I don't I don't know\nYeah I don't know that you want to do that I mean that's that's putting you in a very a boring index where you're going to be a you know go up and down with the market um\nYou know I mean I Would just ask her to give you all the pros and cons of both but but unless you're willing to take risk and a risk of loss\nUm you know then you know you can decide from that but I wouldn't I Would tell her that you are going to be using this money soon at some point in time\nAnd I in the next five years say and you don't want to take a lot of risk you want to preserve your principal\nOkay and then she'll suggest something else okay All right\nThank you thank you sander I appreciate it online\nUm folks yeah so when you think about these are the charitable gift annuities and all that kind of stuff look I mean I mean the commercial nobody's there not charitable gift into his commercial news [noise]\nAh you know remember you're locking yourself in but when you have a deferred annuity you know I Know as a senator says she didn't want to pay the tax on it so she didn't want to get out of it\nYou you it is\nDeferred not tax free some day you're going to pay the tax\nAnd so let's say you broke humiliated gains for ten years then you put it into a new deferred annuity and you go another some so many years you know when you're a human that you're all you're doing is growing your tax bill\nSo you're making your tax bill bigger at some point in time he may become prudent\nTo say you know what I'm just going to start withdrawing or I'm going to take my money\nYou got to pay that\nYou know how I feel sorry for your window into how much I've got to pay and it gives you the freedom to do some other things for money [noise] I mean you've got away a lot of situations [noise] uh when you do that he got to think about a lot of things but [noise]\nWe ever got to be able to be responsible and are investing we've got to be responsible with are giving all we're trying to do
