Florida is awesome place to be 'cause you're right you do get the blue sky you get the sunshine and you do get a little bit of season that's still waiting for it to get called for the fall [laughter]\nKnow what you see this time of year it's I don't want to\nThat's why I'm Still waiting for it to get cold for the fall [laughter] you know what you see this time of year as I go on the highway but you see so many motor home motor home that are travelling south on Ninety five that are coming here\nFor months that come here for six months out of the year from the north from Canada from upstate New York that come to South Florida yes day for six months and then go back home yes\nIt's funny because it's a great place to live here in Florida is so say you know why people return home so we want to give a shout out to miss Karen Gail 'cause we had the pleasure of sitting with her and talking with her and she was delightful\nYeah hey I got a marketing idea wait a minute I have another holdout out wait a minute we're up to me about talking about ways interrupt you okay for that show\nAnd then I Want to go back to those people that are coming down on those motor homes\nOkay so for me I Want to give a shout out to um a couple of people\n... two of them are my some of my favorite people and they had a birthday yesterday so one as my brother in law Tom Kovacs okay well he had a birthday and he always listen he's one of my number one fan so I have to say good morning Tom and happy birthday and the other one is Donna over men who is our boss\nAnd uh she's the broker at the office that we work in and it was her birthday yesterday too so we have to say good morning to Don and she's been a great supporter of hours\nIn that regard year every year the Fifteen year rate it also fell one one hundredth of a percent to four point one five percent this time last year\nThree point one five percent or a whole point over where we were last year we told ...\nHand it happened now you know the V. A. N. F. A. J. rights they always\nLagged behind Tibet yet so you know what happened last year last year last week\nTo the interest rates the other the conventional it went up right so this week it went down well now F. A. J. NBA they went up this week 'cause they're always a week behind so it rose to\nFour and a half percent can you believe that but it's still dirt cheap I didn't know if it's dirt cheap last year was dirt cheap last year was actually [laughter] crazy [laughter]\nUm anyway that five year adjustable rate mortgage it's still a great deal if you only plan on being in your home for five years or less it rose for one hundred percent to four point zero one percent and this time last year three point one eight percent you know going back\nTo that a five year adjustable there are a lot of people that only plan on living in their home for five years because they want to they're getting in their first home\nAnd they think they're going to make a lot more money as their income grows first time homebuyers for example you know they're getting out of college they're buying their first home my son for example is a good example of that he may get married in the next five years told his wife will have\nA ... what I knew they had a good to him [laughter]\nHe might get he might\nGet married he ... he may find the girl of his dreams yes and they might have a child and you know his wife will certainly have an\nIncome and they may want to have a bigger home that may have been a perfect\nMortgage for him he didn't see it that way\nWhen you see what he didn't see it that way that uh that he would want to risk and get a that type of mortgage\nHe wanted a lock in at a lower a at a fixed thirty year rate but there's some people would say yeah I can absolutely see myself getting married and having a child and want a bigger home but he found a home that he really really liked\nBut for some people they really see themselves having a much larger income in five you know sure\nSo you know for example a physician was a you know a medical doctor graduates from school he's in his residency doesn't make much money at all mixed barely enough to be able to afford a house five years from now he's going to be making a whole lot more money might make sense for him to get\nThat five I'm five year\nLoan that we were just talking about you're shaking your head no no no there's better lungs out there for doctors will there are but there are they gave him a hundred percent financing no but those are the ones that are already now done without their\nNo ... no no no no he's still have to be able to afford the loan\nIf you just don't buy as big of a house\nThey get a hundred percent financing and they'll pay him I you're kind of making my point though you still have to be able to afford the home I'm Talking about a real issue in the air\nStill have to be able to afford the home I'm a real issue here think about it you're not paying any principal\nYeah so\nIf you're not paying the principal then you've got to make sure the market's good and that that that the prices are going up you know otherwise are nine that principle\nIt's just a lower interest rate that's all it is is lower interest rate [noise] anyway the important thing is you call Christine ... she will advise you the best loan for your particular sir\nAnd her website it apply with Christine Christine with a K. dot com yeah but if you do you know it's some people are doing what did they daily\nThey're putting fake employers on their application now their current employer they're showing as right but prior employers to show a longer employment history because you know mortgage uh\nCompanies want to show that uh you have a great mortgage loan history um employment history right so that just making up employers that campaign true\nThis was reported\nOh my ... not happened mostly in California but it's it's spreading the word that his bread and my purse and it tells the truth of all the time so we were our that\nI Am but they put fake employers made up dates of employment at companies that didn't even exist or that do exist but they never worked there and\nThe time of you know right before closing um or during the time of uh of underwriting the under writer for the mortgage company goes to check on whether or not\nAll of the information is correct and finds that wait a minute this person never worked at Amazon or never worked at Sears or whatever right and\nNot only is the application for the mortgage declined mhm but some of the banks are now ah the the mortgage companies aren't clamping down by getting the people arrested for mortgage fraud [noise] good good\nIt's what it is it's yeah I Know that none of our listeners would do that of course not and we have a great lesson nurse who are too on yeah but a fake employers can you imagine now\nYou know what we didn't talk about what didn't we talk we didn't talk about how many houses were on the market this week and now many sold and\nWhat was your time it's time for it you see I'm just trying to carve out some time for myself right\nAccording to the northeast Florida multiple listing service this past week for homes and condominiums six hundred and thirty eight offers got accepted\nThat's about the same as it was last week so that shows their activity in the marketplace now you're ready for this number seven hundred and sixty nine new homes came on the market that's up eight percent from last week I\nThink about that Howard I'm thinking about it you know what happened a hundred and fifty and those are already under contract Howard that's twenty percent sold already in the first week and people think\nNah hall that housing market falls\nThat's correct but it doesn't that's twenty percent now fifty two\nOf those actually went under contract and the very first day so that's like a little less than ten percent\nThings are happening out here\nSix hundred and Ninety three people close on a home for themselves and we say congratulations man [noise] that when people think\nOh this is the wrong time of year I don't want to put my house on the market\nBlah blah blah blah they should not be thinking that Beijing guys the houses are still selling\nThey are and that continued to Seattle they're well they're one of the things that we've told people and we we've told people this time of year for the last few years is all do and you'll see over the next month or so there'll be fewer houses are selling yeah here is the secret that few\nRealtors know about what\nWe're going to report that led houses sell it is absolutely true there'll be less houses on the market that is absolutely true\nThere are less buyers that is absolutely true here's the big however ready yes of course you know this because we've talked about it and other listeners have been listening for years notice\nThe same percentage of houses sell every month of the year\nSo it doesn't matter when you put your house on the market\nThe likelihood that it sells whether it's January June September or December it is just as likely to sell now there'll be less people looking at your house if you put it on the market but the ones that look at it bears serious buyers yes last tier kicker less\nTired takers Syria's buyers just as likely to sell years less competition for your house\nSale previously didn't our numbers show around twelve percent per week now we're already consistent with Fifteen to twenty percent per week yeah we're going to tell our lifestyle and the market ... bind part of it has to do with interest rates are going now they want to get in now but for the rates are too high and it's not affordable\nYeah there is another reason to buy and sell this time of year we've been talking about that if we have time but I really want to talk about a a news segment when we\nThat we've never really talked about before it's called [noise] I Wish I listened to Angela and Howard X number of months ago we hear that all the times they would say everyone [noise] you're going to hear a lot of stories relating to wish I'd listen to an to an hour [noise]\nDon't think that you're necessarily going to get the money out of it if it you just have to look at if it's you know ...\nDecorator things you're not going to get that money out of it look at what similar houses are selling for not similarly decorated houses for\nSo if you put in a a paver patio in the back or a fire pit in the back you're pretty much not going to get money for that sort of all the other houses in the neighborhood don't have that and their price accordingly then\nPrice it according to what other houses are and then you'll get more people to see your house yours may feel much quicker it might sell for a little bit\nMore but price it properly the first time\nThat's the that's really the key is pricing it properly out at the gate\nOr at the second thing is we suggested that you stage the house or either that it's a perhaps vacant or that or it just to have a stage or come look it over to suggest a few things to make it look a little bit better [noise]\nSo this has always kind of a tricky one right so people don't want to spend the extra money to get their household but it's an investment it's like anything else you need to recognize this is a competition it's like a beauty competition right so you're going to make your house beautiful and\nYou've got to make people want it and many times when people come into a vacant home\nI'm not to throw my gender under the bus or anything but it's harder for women\nIn particular who are the decision makers to determine whether or not they're couch will fit in a certain space or their dining room table but if there's already a couch they're they're pretty good about saying oh my couches that size they don't fit or by table is\nYou know smaller than that one it'll fit so\nStaging is such a helpful process because it's like getting ready for you to beauty pageant gates making it gorgeous and then people can envision their own lifestyle there because the stage or is going to\nDecorate home according to like where it's located for instance like the townhouse that we have listed at the beach you know it's very coastal the way that that stage or did the decorating for more it fits the\nTown home appropriately more importantly for that one here's a perfect example it's a small town house yet and the first few people that looked at it says it's too small right I don't think I'm going to be able to buy it because it's too small well then we convince the owner\nJust he didn't want to stage it at first right nobody wants to spend extra money we get that so then we can against him to stage it kept any staged it and after that nobody complained that it was too small right we didn't get a look at her nurture in it\nAnd it made it very cozy it made it not not ... you could see what you could see that that fit yeah and then he admitted gosh just looks gr now and then nobody complained that it was too small\nYeah exactly that's a great illustration of aging is important it's super super import it cannot be I Can't over estimated\nEnough connect on repaid a room or even a wall in a room to remove a bright or dark color\nMm Mm [noise] so what happens is people tend to discount your home based upon what they think needs to be done\nAnd if they are unable to paint themselves then you know it's like oh that's going to cost five thousand dollars when maybe it's not [laughter] I bet they over estimate the price and then they start to discount you greatly because it's not move in ready you know\nAnd so we highly recommend that you change it and the one thing I Would always tell people when I'm asking them to change a colored that they love\nIs that they're not going to live here anymore\nAnd that we need to get it ready for the next to buy or sell you know buyers have\nThis um desire to have what everybody else who wants to say like right now the colors agreeable gray it's kind of a hand kind of gray can go either way [noise]\nUm you know they they the colors change every once in awhile but there's neutral color that we use that attract the\nMost amount of people when we come back after the break I'm going to tell a story about changing the color in a townhouse [noise]\nIn a bar term spring yeah that was only ... once told a story ones but it's a great story on how we convince the owner to do something good took a little while to convince him\nIt made a miraculous difference\nIn his pocket book yeah how about this [laughter] [noise] so stay with us everyone to hear that story [noise]\nWe had to change the entire color of his town out netted him\nGrandmother and then we'll

that to me doesn't really matter\nTo six like everything else but we thought it matters blonde me out of my neighbors have such a good start we're setting records this week\nRight and then through and then something happened yeah I mean we gave a little bit of a back but it was it was an interesting week there was a lot happening honestly towards the end of the week especially I'm caught something happened that I think was long\nYeah absolutely towards the end of the week especially I'm ... something happened that I think was long overdue I'll get to that in a minute\nBut all in all it was kind of a week where everything did at one eighty from the rest of the year and we've seen that trend this year where\nJust there'll be a week or two where everything reverses things that have done well do poorly and things that have done poorly do well and that was definitely the case of them were you saying that for several weeks now the up and coming you'll you'll hear the term reverse into the mean which just means that that everything kind of\nGoes back to average so are the most striking example this week was the Dow versus the NASDAQ the NASDAQ dropped a pretty staggering two hundred and fifty points are three point two percent while the Dow dropped eleven pointers zero percent and so the U.S and people's right in the middle of one percent down\nMoney sooner is better than money later more money is better than less money all those things\nSo recently the yield curve was pretty flat meaning that a bond that was due in five years was paying pretty similarly to a bond that was due in Thirty years yeah so which one you're going to buy I Would buy the five year\nDepends on your interest rate experts say well less risk if we were if we were at the top of what everybody knew was interest rates aren't going any higher fair you buy it as long as you can write but but you know and no way no exactly\nSo you would buy the short one hoping that interest rates will go up and then you could roll that into a higher paying bucks either\nWell for whatever reason this week the flip the switch flipped and long term interest rates started rising and they rose pretty substantially over the last uh two days of the week or no\nUm [noise] that's something that really needed to happen because when you see if that hadn't happened and they started dropping that would mean the yield curve inverted and if you've ever heard of that it's a very good recession indicator not necessarily an immediate recession but one that's coming in the next one to three years\nAnd you all know that when I say the financial media I Am not complimenting anyone [laughter] I have a very very low opinion of financial media and they have a motive they have been predicting this yield curve and version for a long time\nThey want to talk about the upcoming recession that Donald Trump\nCause actually write their motive is a November six motives they want everything to be as bad as possible and election\nDay so all of a sudden this are so long term right started going up which is actually a sign that that the economy is doing well and will continue to do well\nAnd so it's actually a really good sign for America buy stocks didn't like it and so they got pummeled and sort of bonds and pretty much everything that have been doing well went\nDown in stocks don't like it because people say oh my gosh the bond yield is looking pretty good time to move a whole bunch of money over there you know there's a lot less risk and bonds and stocks\nYeah exactly so do I want to own the U.S and the five hundred paying to point whatever percent in dividends or do I want to own a long term bond that's now going to pay me three point something had read through better yeah so\nThat suddenly looks a little bit more attractive than it did a couple of days ago and and that's really all that happened and so all this craziness we saw is is just that and it'll get worked out in my opinion and we'll go back to valuing the stock market on what we should witches earnings\nOkay I'm a once again good morning Chuck\n... guys\nHow how are things today\n[noise] well you know um [noise] market was down interest rates are ... inflation and you know who who for told this Twenty years ago\nI'm listening to Rush Limbaugh and he was doing a parody a senator or its Hollings and artists Hollings said ah there's too much consuming going on out\nThere in ... right [noise]\nAnd that was about the same time Clinton was saying well we can give you a tax cut but how do you know how do we know that you'd spend at the right way [noise]\nThat was in Buffalo I Believe he he didn't buffalo me [noise]\nYeah you're absolutely right I remember that line like it was yesterday's Russia does refer to them as fog horn legs on\n[laughter] too much going on out his other frame of mind is where is that air bond market [noise]\nSame same era [laughter] what a guy yeah you're absolutely right [laughter] you just said\nYou know something nobody talks about anymore is what I'm a ... or the former Tennessee senator yeah it's just days he used to call the deficit\nDie off as a swing ... these ... you know it's funny to people from that band of states are far more southern than people down here\nThere's a lot of them are very difficult if you're a northerner and you're not used to hearing that a lot of them are very difficult to understand over the last Thirty years I've kinda grown used to that back then they sounded pretty weird\n... you're right there this was all very predictable the cycle is what the cycle is interest rates rise and fall economy rises and falls and right now anyone who wouldn't predict just looking at the simplest numbers that are out there the GDP number the unemployment number and so on of course we're in\nAnd the simplest numbers that are out there the GDP numbers the unemployment number and so on of course we're in a strong up cycle what's gonna happen interest rates are going to go up to yield curve is going to change its as predictable if you understand basic economics which rules out their financial media as it could possibly be\nThe only thing that changes the length of the cycles and getting longer and longer over time as we are in a lot of people attribute that to the fed and monetary policy\nWell by molested take credit for the very very lengthy recovery that he presided over the only reason it took that long is because it was so slow [laughter] what can you say when you've got a population has grown by\nA few million a year is it averages about three million a year your economy is going to grow by us most of the sub nothing else so here we are at three hundred and thirty million people were Twenty years ago maybe two hundred sixty million people of course the economy is going to be bigger\nBut it's still cyclical which I Do remember check what do you remember when Bill Clinton said you'd be field the business cycle\n[noise] I don't remember that\nHe actually came out on TV and said we repealed the business cycle\nHow about that one you know what year it was no I don't you should love this doesn't and won Nineteen Ninety nine close enough what happened in early two thousand in income boom and bust that it was almost like he created it\nBy saying something so ridiculous\nYeah yeah you got to pay attention that's a nice thing about getting older I remember a lot of this stuff\nAnd then eventually you will that\nWhen you get old enough the only thing that remembers what happened Twenty years true very true\nThough I I grew up listening to talk radio and uh Nineteen I think I started listening to rush in Ninety two and I was Sean Hannity when I was living in Atlanta and so for me I fell in love with talk radio in the early nineties and that's a huge source of\nHow I get information to this day\nI used to drive back and forth between Wisconsin and Florida several times a year\nAnd I got on to talk radio Russia had been on for about a month when I started listening would listen in the car all the way down there and I only found out about all this because I have some really good friends who are traveling salesman the radios were on all the time and one of them came to sue me one day and said you\nGotta here this guy he's right up your alley by\nThe way there's nothing worse than being trapped in a car with your dad listening to Rush Limbaugh when your ten years old [laughter]\nBut look look what happened with her [laughter]\nHe's sitting here making sense as nice as we have to teach them something [laughter] [laughter] it's fun\nAnyway it's important for kids as young\nAge you know how they should think about politics I mean I'm loading my my son and you know ... if you don't hold them\nThan when they get in the hands of these liberal professors or they're going to get you know come to their their brains are going to get a dance with a girl Barr show you got to hold your kids are very young age and talk radio is one way to do it\nYou're absolutely right that about ... thank goodness for talk radio and\nFox News and all the other outlets where you can get a different viewpoint from the mainstream [noise] important that's one of the reasons that we like doing what we do it's a little bit different look good topics that are of interest to everybody ... mainly money [noise]\nWhich I Do you want to pick a shot at the Warren Buffett's net worth before it's fifty how what percentage of sanitation\nRelated\nI'm Guy have no I'm totally stumped on this on a A R pastor let somebody else\nWill keep listen to the end you'll be interested\nOkay I Will thanks for the call backtrack okay take All right bye [noise] All right man I've\nI you know I've often thought about that to what would I be doing now if I hadn't grown up listening to things like that I don't know I really don't know\nYeah who knows I mean the world's changed now I listen to podcasts instead of talk radio it's kind of like the two thousand ten version of of uh of talk radio\nWhen you know when these guys like ... we're just getting started in this stuff and people there they're naysayers would always say well they tell everybody what to think no they don't they tell everybody how to think that's what you learn listen to\nTalk radio how to get any different than liberal professor talking to students and oh yeah they are most of us so to me it's a one eight\nAnyway we've gotten lots more to say after the break we're going to really tear apart the jobs are worth a show you what it means to have recording come out on the slanted basis instead of understanding what actually goes on out there because I'm telling you this this week for the sand wisely\nIt was one of the best job three four weeks in the history of this country it was really good in Haiti the reform was also really good it was and and I liked that because it confirms them\nEach other and I was like when that happens mostly went back and said well the rest of the summer's really been pretty spectacular too so we'll get into all of that right after the break going anywhere this is the band we

a little warm for me\n[laughter] anybody ever done a study on his ah Scott fix than uh you know especially during the lightning around I I gotta feeling I'd be multimillionaire if I Would have just gone the other way if he says\nBut there was one if you if you Google him and there was a problem a few years ago when he he took something public but it was his opinion and I don't know if it resulted in bankruptcy but it was almost that bad because so many people listening to him and did this\nSo I just I don't think that any entertainer which is what is is should have that much sway over people at least if they do because you can't argue when when you're so famous people listen to you\nYou can't argue with that because I have been very successful but I think you owe it to your public to be very cautious about you what you will say in what they won't say and I think he goes overboard a little too frequently for my taste\nBut they're so sue me right\nYeah really I Know a year you're old enough to Adam wouldn't remember there was a guy that used to predict football the called Jimmy Greek Snyder uh\nAnd uh I was in another life I used to bet on football and I would wait till he made his picks and call it my book and just go the other way [laughter] it's how how did you do\nOh I Will be exciting one two three [laughter] I mean sometimes three [laughter] you know take take take the pill or take eagles ... three and a half and I call my guy Dan and give me Dallas\nAnd a half [laughter] thirty it off [laughter] and it was a sad day for me when he got fired because that

and it's really great to be with you\nNice to be with you as well tell us your story because maybe people because my show people are driving to work and it's not necessarily a health and wellness at about taking one hundred percent responsibility in owning I live here how your journey began\nYeah absolutely so I was diagnosed with stage three colon cancer when I was twenty six years old this was December of two thousand three\nAnd a you know being a young guy I was having abdominal pains I thought I had an ulcer and eventually or a doctor did a colonoscopy because they couldn't figure out what was wrong and found a golf ball sized tumor in my large tests\nYou know I don't tell people not to do chemo or not to do treatment or whatever but for me it it just I couldn't wrap my brain around this idea of\nYou know taking something that would definitely make me worse\nAnd and there was no guarantee it would make me better\nAnd so but I didn't know what else to do and so my wife and I prayed about it and I just said God it's there's another way besides chemotherapy please show me I don't know what to do and you know it was just a very sincere prayer of a desperation I just just asking for help\nA couple of days later I got a book that was sent to me by my dad or by a friend of my dad's who lived in Alaska I'm In Tennessee and I get a book and I start reading this book and it was it was talking about human cancer with nutrition and the guy who wrote it healed his own colon cancer with nutrition something like Thirty years prior still alive and\nI just knew that was the answer to my prayer was it was just so clear to me I was on the couch in my house choked up like literally just sitting there just crying because I knew got an instrument my parents had given me something um and I had a huge epiphany and the epiphany was\nThe way I was living was killing me Mm right is the way I was living it was my diet and my lifestyle\nAnd the negative emotions in my life to which we'll talk about yeah [noise] so I realized I had to change I I had to had to make a massive radical changes in my life and I was excited about that because\nAll of a sudden I got my power back yeah you know most cancer patients\nAre are are turned into powerless victims and father doctors not to the doctors mean to do it but what happens is every conversation a cancer patient I mean every cancer patient has this conversation where they say why do you think I got cancer\nAt what caused my cancer and the doctor says oh yeah well it's probably probably just bad luck\nYou know ... you know gain genetic now you're saying yeah\nAnd what that does is that the doctor saying there's nothing you did to contribute to your disease because they don't want to hurt anybody's feelings mhm therefore there's nothing you can do to help yourself correct right ... other than show up for treatment\nMm you are a power the victim will will do the best to take care of you just rely on us and you just go home back to your life that just dress mess of life\nIt's unhealthy in many ways just go back to that life keep eating whatever you want thinking the way you want doing what you're doing\nAnd in by the way you should actually eat more junk food [laughter] you should be more ice cream and pizza or a ... and milk shakes because we we don't want you to lose too much weight during treatment\nAbsolutely yes absolutely and and so because you don't have any information so as I was preparing for today show and knowing that you really truly in all the wonderful thing will lead okay before we I I go into that\nYou went with a resolution that he was never going to have chemotherapy\nWell no no I actually I just made a decision that I I didn't want to do it right away and I thought okay who's more of a last resort for me to pay\nSo now you're going to go visit the on college as and what happened there\nRight so [laughter] overnight I can transform my life okay I ... I converted to a raw food diet\nRaw fruits and vegetables straight from the earth because this ... I had um was that I needed to get back in harmony with nature I Need to eat food straight from the earth right that God made for us like fruits and vegetables and I was eating a\nProcessed food diet tons of meat and dairy tons of fast food processed food junk food anything I Want it and I realized like this is probably what's making me sick and we know now I Know for certain that was back then I had very little information but we know that\nOnly five percent of cancers are genetic in in up to Ninety five percent of cancers are caused by three factors diet lifestyle and environment yes stresses an underlying causes which we can get to but ah but the scientific community is you know pretty much in agreement on this and so\n[noise] ah I ... I'm going to change my life that changed my diet change when environment I gotta detoxify like I got to turn my life upside down and help myself get well and I was excited about that it was and it sort of like an adventure to me and I couldn't wait to see what would happen if I did it and I believed what helped me\nUm and so immediately I bought a juice or I went to you know whole foods and bloated up on fruits and vegetables and I was like on my way but people around me didn't like that yes they are they were many people around me close to me we're trying to talk me out of it\nAnd they well they absolutely they didn't that I I think one of those people saying oh you need to have chemotherapy before I started the show\nThey love me right and they wanted they wanted me to live and they were doing\nThey love me right and they wanted they wanted me to live and they were did basically saying look you know you've got to do with the doctor says I mean don't you think it's something better they would know about it yeah they they've got the best treatments available\nAnd I'm like a well I don't know I you know I didn't have good answers for those questions at the time [noise] and so all what happened was they love me but they ended up creating a lot of a lot more fear anxiety and confusion cracked\nIn my mind and heart and that made it really I realized if I'm going to do this I Am going to have to do it alone so reluctantly agreed to go see the oncologist because there's so much family pressure we\nGo to the clinic the waiting room stacked I look around it's full of people who are twice my age ... three times in my age yeah again remember I'm twenty six handled bar moustache shaggy hair like I'm a rock to do [laughter] and I'm like God I don't belong here ...\nWe sit down and watching the TV waiting to go back you know you're you go to the docks off you're going to wait for an hour\nAnd there's but there's cooking says cooking out there waiting for their warning me\nCookies I probably would've eaten at that time you know there weren't even any good snag are but um we're watching the TV and outcomes jak slow lane\n... on one of the morning shows and Jack comes out and he starts going off I don't know why he was on the show maybe it was his birthday or he was doing something special but anyway I think he was Seventy eight at the time comes out and he starts going off about nutrition\nAnd he's saying or is there also stinks because reading all this man made processed food and junk food you need to go back to a diet that's fruits and vegetables\nAnd juicing and man made it don't eat it\nAnd I mean I was like oh my gosh I Can't believe this is on right now with me sitting in the cancer clinic like it's like the message right like divine divinely beamed and yeah for me to hear it at the perfect time which may be happening to some of your listeners now I Hope so I Hope so too and so uh I was like turn him I turned my wife and I was like\nCan you believe this is on right now [laughter] and she's like it's very weird [laughter] so\nWe go back to see that the oncologist I should have just gotten up right then and been like I'm Out of here but we go back and see the oncologist and he gives me the standard pitch you know he's like look you got stage three C colon cancer you're young adult it's very aggressive and young adults are you you need\nA chemotherapy we want to give you five if you look for foreign and five if you by the way is known as five feet under a\nThat's a great a nickname for that drugs are the only ... only ... drug with the worst nickname is uh the docks robust and which they call red death so anyway um\nHe\n... you know he said you've got about sixty percent chance of living five years with treatment and I'm like gosh sixty percent I mean that's kind of low it doesn't it's not a very high percentage and that's making me kinda nervous and not real confident about the treatment\nSure [noise] so um [noise] I Know we've got a break coming up so I Know I don't want to get out friday and\nHere's the thing so then I asked him well or any other any alternative treatments available and he says\nNo there are none if you don't do chemotherapy you're in St ... and at that point the conversation changed from you\nKnow pleasant to him becoming very aggressive and demeaning and talking down to me and it gives me all these reasons why I had to do chemotherapy and basically saying in so many words if you don't do it I say you're going to die [noise]\nAnd that's why many people experience when they think they have\nAny people are taking out there and then they're they're because they're afraid that and they might get it and this is a show about empowerment and free to sell the the tenth collar store here seven three seven three five nine five nine and when that to be the tenth scholars they wind up a copy of the book\nChris the cancer for movie time with Chris when we return was white out when you need a friend dot com here waiting and\nWell the ... you know the the way my can't cancer clinic visit ended was I was so afraid that I made an appointment to start with therapy or in a few weeks and I went in there confident feeling good I'd been on a raw food diet for a week and I was excited about changing my life and the process of doing it and I left there just completely\nTerrified and hopeless and\n[noise] but uh I had an appointment the next day to go see a notch or pass I'm a clinical nutrition\nAn appointment the next day to go see a natural gas and a clinical nutritionist who was a master herbalist and natural path\nAnd dad visit was very different than the oncologist visit and he gave me he was the first person to tell me I was doing the right thing and that was huge for me I mean no one had said you were doing the right thing pretty much everybody around me was like you're doing the wrong thing and his office was a very peaceful\nAnd calming soothing and it just felt good being there there was no fear\nIn his office and uh so I but he was the first person I've found and I have to give credit to my mom my mom's a health nut she always supported me and she had a bunch of books by Jack the by a poll brag and ... and\nUm all of these health and wellness in ... uh she connected me with Dr Lorraine day's work Yeah Dr Richard show so my mom was just amazing resource for me\nYeah hell of it if you're going to be called a not being a health nut is a good thing so that's a good thing so finding that in finding that uh that was aligning with your intention with your your intuition was telling you don't do this Chris\nYeah and you know you know you're right so I was listening my instinct and intuition I prayed I asked for an answer information came to me\nAnd but I had opposition right and that's really tough in a lot of times when you when God Speaks to you and tells you to do something or you're going to have opposition America and people around you might think you're insane are doing it\nAnd that's right where I was but you you're talking about the fear for finding information finding support finding help so I was on a quest right to find help them find support and to learn more like how can I help myself\nYes very good okay so they take the money\nThat he is education doing research which is what you actually did and now you've got this book that is going to just hand it to people so let's talk about that either at the the the process that it took from\nShifting that mentality that chemotherapy radiation and surgery were the only answer after all these years trillions of dollars in research\nWe still have the same answers in conventional medicine so how did you find yourself how did you educate yourself\n[noise] yeah you know it's funny back then the Internet was not helpful\nUm I just it just wasn't there ... there was no YouTube in January two thousand four didn't come along every day there's no Facebook of course no social media so beer and it was very different and you know I looked around for ... for some websites about\nYou know alternative cancer treatments and things and didn't find anything sharp as we just went from one book to the next to the next the next was only books and tapes and I had some ... I had a video cassette of Lorraine Day uh I had a some cassette tapes and books by Dr Richard show\nAnd some other books in my mom's library that I was going through and as I\nProceeded to educate myself or re educate myself\nYou know it was all driven by this this core beliefs that I'm\n... that I was the way I was living was killing me and I needed to change my wife and I needed to help my body heal and so when I was looking at\nA conventional cancer treatment I realized that you know many medical treatment today only treat the symptoms of a disease mhm they don't treat the disease itself so you can poison the tremor cut it off radiate it but the gym or is not the disease cancer is a\nSystem wide metabolic disease the tumors are this symptom of the correct body yes\nYou're not sick because you have cancer you have cancer because you're sick correct and so you can cut tumors off all day long but you're going to grow new tumors unless you change the internal terrain of your body and make your body a place where cancer cannot drive\nThe only difference between someone with tumors and someone with no tumors is the internal terrain and your body is made up of many different systems that I'll have to work together but most of us know one of those ... one of the most important systems in there is your immune system\nMhm and so if you have a weak immune system or immune system that's overloaded\nBecause there's so much toxic junk that you're putting in your body every day\nThen it's not going to do a great job identifying and eliminating cancer cells which is what a healthy immune system would do so I my focus shifted from or just got to kill this cancer right which is that the typical mentality to I Need to rebuild my body I Need to support my body's ability to heal itself\nRight and how do you do that will nutrition is a huge component right 'cause that's a huge component\nIs radically changing your diet is giving your body all these wonderful nutrient [noise] that are in fruits and vegetables [noise] absolutely and so\nWe talk a lot about nutrition on the line with different radio show that it's not the end all be all there's more than we need to

[noise] so Thursday was a bleak it was an ugly ugly day\nIf you woke up and you heard the news on Thursday morning news was that morning well that was the news about rising bond\nYields yields\nAnd the news that China is implanting\nThe tiny buying chips and all of the government's computers and phones the iPhones the defense department's computers the Navy's computers all of the computers\nThat we buy from China have a chip in them according to the\nBloomberg Businessweek article you would not have been surprised then on Thursday morning to see the market fall all\nDay I've been warning you all that I thought inflation could get out of control could get ugly ugly\nMore on that later in the show though I've been talking to you about the\nChina trade war and about two or three weeks ago I warn you that the war had been downgraded downgraded to a skirmish skirmish and then it was likely to be downgraded even further\nTo us back to his fat because the\nPresident said he loves China he loves president gee there'd be there'd be a mess\n\nBut on Thursday we find out that China's putting computer chips by chips are in every electronic device will use at home and then the government that the government uses presumably to I don't know launch nuclear weapons I don't know to start a war\nI don't know\nEvery every every computer that the government's got got got secret Chinese chips in them\nChinese chips not and so so let's get to that story and and the\nAnd the story of according to Sean Hannity is good men and women\nOf the FBI you know how Sean I says well I'm not talking about the bad men and women of the FBI like Jim call me\nBut they're still working day every day working guy at the FBI the good guys are really good guy they really do a good job\nAnd yet Hillary is still an indicted I understand the story [noise] I don't understand what makes them so good but maybe I'm wrong\nHere's a China spy chip story from Bloomberg Businessweek and this story\nThis story could have huge ... stock market implications\n\nAnd twenty Fifteen Amazon Amazon began quietly evaluating a startup company called elemental technologies are potential acquisition to help with a major expansion\nOf their of their streaming service streaming video service that we know today as Amazon Prime video\nElemental technology had help stream the Olympic Games online and it helped communicate with the international space station and had ... and if funneled drone footage from the various wars to the CIA\n\nElemental national security contracts weren't the main reason for the proposed acquisition but they fit nicely with Amazon government business such as a\nHighly secure cloud that Amazon Web services is planning to sell to the to the CIA how many of you know that the CIA was going to host top secret information on the same crowd that you host pictures of your dog\nI knew that because I pay attention\nTo help with due diligence Amazon Web services which was overseeing the prospect of acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nThe first pass uncovered troubling issues prompting Amazon Web services to take a closer look at elemental main product the extensive servers that customers installed in their networks to handle video compression\nThese servers were assembled for elemental by super micro computer now my old company supercomputer super micro computer uh San jose based company commonly known as super micro\nIt's also one of the world's biggest supplier of mother boards mother boards or the ... board inside of your computer that upon which sits all the other junk\nRight\nIn late spring of twenty Fifteen elemental\nElemental staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario now this is good right so elemental is going to send samples servers to Ontario so that's some company in Ontario can determine if those servers\nThat are going to the CIA are safe\nSo we're now we're now we're now outsourcing national security to the milk sucking Canadians who wanna let us sell a milk until this week it powdered milk to be accurate that\nSo I don't know why we're outsourcing our our our national security to some company\nAnd Canada hoarding milk\nThat stood on the servers mother boards the testers found a tiny microchip not much bigger than a grain of rice that wasn't supposed to be part of the boards original design now the first thing I think all you people at home should know\nAbout the CIA and the fear Federal Bureau of idiots and the so called good men and women who can't even find a cause to indict Hillary is that in the business of examining computer parts right like if you're in pal or\nYour applied materials or kale like ten corps or your um land research\nWhen they inspect the computer chip they're there and back then the way for that the that the chip is ultimately etched on their their engraving it down to ... they're they're inspecting it down to the nano meter nanometers level at whatever level is below nano meter\nI have multiple officers and most of the city that I Do business and\nYou pick the day you pick the time\nI'll send you an email on a map with directions to the office it's closest to you and that's all you have to do a little while later\nYou're going to receive an invitation to register for the amazing Gemini private client portal involved as well as some basic on boarding questions are kind of need the government kind of like you to answer so I can make sure you're a real person that kinda thing and then you just sit back and wait for the meeting to start\n[noise] so I'm Peter Navarro Peter Navarro\nWants to tell you that our being held hostage to Chinese steel\nIs the most important thing in the world we have to have our own national sources Steele\n\nI Would tell you we need to have our own national source of semiconductor production of computer production of electronics manufacturing so now it's your\nChoice choose me or choose Peter\nThat moron Navarro\nBecause I Would argue to you we can always get steal from China we've got plenty of the uh we can make in the United states\nBut well we don't have in this country is a reliable workforce that can manufacture high tech electronics and semi conductors we don't have a reliable source or we don't have a reliable logistics chain\nFor those items\nSo it's up to you to decide you can go after steel which is I don't know what thousands of years old or you can go after high tech electronics you tell me which one of those two jobs using pays the most\nSo let me see if I understand the story so far the hoarding to Sean Hannity that good men and women over the FBI who still can't find a reason\nTo indict Hillary or Christine bubbles Ford or that any ... mosque for stock price manipulation they can't find a computer chip the size of an enormous grain of rice but the folks that apple\n\nCan I fear chai comes may have the keys to our nuclear systems are worse to our money\nThe Chinese government didn't directly address questions about the manipulation supply chains safety they say in in cyberspace as an issue of common concern China's a victim\n\nMeanwhile the FBI CIA can't find a chip the size of a grain of rice\nThe mother board of a computer which is the equivalent of you finding a gigantic Goodyear Blimp\nIn your living room I may be wrong\nI digress Mardi please tell me there's a point to this ridiculous story please tell me that you've not may mean listen to this incredibly long over my head boring story to make the point that China is buying on the please Marty telling me there's more to this radio program all there is more\nYeah there is more\nThis could be a serious\nThere could be a serious retaliation justifiably that\nCouldn't markets so it will be interesting to see how the president manages to deal with China\nKnowing that they're spying on everything from your your Amazon Alexa all the way up to his aircraft carriers\n\nGot to be honest with you you know I got to be honest with you if this doesn't put price if if if listen if exposing\nThis story is saying that the Chinese hey we know what you did and we know how you did it if that doesn't bring them into the twenty first century\nWhere they can agree to cease and desist from this pattern of behavior\nIf this doesn't bring them to a trade negotiation that results in the end of this kind of behavior\n... maybe ...\nMaybe dumber than I think or maybe as dumb as I think he is smart\nPresident has every right to break China over this this is an existential risk to the United states this is an existential risk to the United states\nAnd we don't have a supply chain or a manufacturing center in this country to replace the equipment that comes from China and we don't have a ... we don't have a reliable partner\nIn Asia that we should be relying on not one computer\nThe defense department should be made by any company other than a one hundred percent American Company with one hundred percent sourcing in the United states and we're going to put US Steel and the damp pipes that we used to deliver\nThe states and we're going to put US Steel and the damn pipes that we used to deliver oil or ... or liquid oil from Canada to the United states if that's got to be us pipe the computers need to be us computers\n\nTwo weeks ago I diagnosed the problem of Ilan mosque of Twitter fame\nYou know him as the CEO of Tesla that overpriced electric car that probably will never succeed because nobody actually needs a self driving crap in it\nAfter I ripped him and his car company again over his comments to the SEC I don't know what was it the beginning of football season one is it now for games and\nAnd so you probably you know as I was floating in the pool with my good buddies jak and Arturo last friday afternoon you're probably laughing at me because you heard over the weekend that he made a deal he made a deal with\nThe SEC and by by the time the markets opened on Monday the shares were not down but they were up forty five dollars boy must you have thought how stupid I was\nOkay but I warned you never trust the Twitter famed\nYeah it's the kind of person that has to tweet out his life his dog is kept picture of his grandkids what's going on in the White House today when he had for breakfast what what's going on a Tesla\n... there's there's something\nI don't know mentally unstable about that behavior because frankly I don't want to know Ninety nine percent of your life I I don't want to know any of the things going on in your life but he Alon mosque\nCan't help themselves and so this Friday morning before the markets even open\nHe's on another ramp\n... but this time twittering against the SEC daring the judge who has to approve the SEC deal with him daring that judge on new that deal and drive him out of the ... have you guys want to invest with a nut job like any line mosque\nI think you should do that shares are down to a half percent as I wrote to show around four or five\nIn the morning [noise]\nOther major story of the money week was was the investing week was your retirement week was\nThe
