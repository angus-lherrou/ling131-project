your your take on\nThis reopening of the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh there are some Republicans\nWho say well this is a good thing because it uh gives cover to people like flake can Collins or to actually vote for cabin on in the end\nYou know this has been about I'm away from the get go\nAnd um I think what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this got from from ... she said well this person asked for confidentiality [noise] um\nThis could have been investigated by the FBI authoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted and um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nOne at it to me it seemed very obvious from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the airing screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the left believes the Supreme Court just another a\nSuper legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a social policy making body to the left and for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who gets appointed came to be so important that it was one judge has started I'm putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago\nWhen when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from a number of surrounding we'd rather amendments I'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they could make it up as they want a long\nAnd so then I guess it very much batters who whose head is popping out from beneath a black [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I'd never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who\nIdentifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally I've never heard of her but then so be it neither\nNow so she she she know express something that I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege for infants here\nWhich is titled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this is not the case no one is a title to go on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed at the way who did it on Thursday\nDeserves to be given an judge\nReaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think we're to kill us\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side the we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan\n... you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats year high school I don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade wise just high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your\nCharacter and I find it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful indiscretions pass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well we saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament for the new question judge it as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way [noise]\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said FBI can has free rein that's a phrase you gave free rein a\nFree rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check and background checks are are not about you know are not about ... I'm not criminal investigations and then I ... counter intelligence with\nTheir background investigations and the interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise] now\nThe um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed\nPresident [noise] you know\nThe um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh's thing there and he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation and [noise]\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking\nIs now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now\nWhat we're going to be judged on I I don't know who want want these you know these nomination but I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly you didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all did stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just to have it\nFor ... right yeah no nothing nothing stupid things\nBut it all your your your um UK is all about the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] if there's anybody who would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um\nThe American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early on or that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was it the\nPresident of the of the APA picked up a pen and his letterhead ah and wrote something he wasn't authorized to write um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nAnd he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so you\nKnow the again initial reports all over cable on friday and when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and written reporters don't do their work they say oh this is ... that's really bad\nAnd now of course we find out that that's all all not true a judge thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate your insights and and we'll check back with you soon and you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura Jeff Flake a lot of you from Arizona calling in chime in a ear reaction to what he did on friday and his appearance\nAt the global citizen festival with a

call it that dismantling affects all of our other institutions whether it's you know kicking oh a little league coach or saying a teacher in ... in schools should be fired or your neighbor uh shouldn't have shot a gun on where you're out all those disputes when they even then when they don't reach\nA level of criminal a status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys have the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual so\nWell when we when we see the few moments of honesty\n[noise] uh when they really talk candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote on the corner it's not about whether Brent did this or whether they're and none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said he admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have a they never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that when the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... said I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions on a white male they didn't go scholar and say you're a racist and we're going to stop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years\nAnd they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use political use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote there would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's take us down the road to perdition all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they will now that's that's a progressive idea of it the noble and justify any means necessary if they're\nYou know it's also interesting I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch today on MSNBC Becker let's listen\nNow for an entire generation of women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way actually post capital reforms that as a man I was in Dallas for him\nHe was doing both of them a display of whites title met\nThe man who made his money in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake going all the people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in self Donny Deutsch\nWell I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being devoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear Judy case who we are that is race class\nNot class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's been who's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote\nOf color and the same thing is true of Chuck Schumer and the string things through cones there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy\nBut they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology combs right back boomerang right back at them so you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say\nOr white guy old white guy old white guy even one day and they're all like they're all old white\nGuys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nHave Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation the exam shoe from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his houses and all these old white guys that privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV\nLet's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities in the world but you have\nA lot of that that would\nMake that very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect it\nNow ah the we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in\nUh in California there has to be female representation on public point at which point at which point I tweeted out none of the Pacific islanders all Latino isn't a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on board\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be a lot of these boards and there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew or through the gate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and indeed and percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves\nYou know a set of site on the sport or we're going down there and I don't know whether the ultimate project Korea's but either people are going to say you know what\nIt is getting chaotic when we go just stop this and go back to the melting pot just look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan [noise]\nYeah well I think again it it was all identity politics at its worst I mean that's never good practice identity politics that you see this even in in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hopper\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean I don't really agree with us and I don't like his music and I I'm not here not my not my cup of tea but talk about breed going out on stage on Saturday Night live the bastion\nAbout brain going out on stage on Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive entertainment and wearing a make America great again hat standing on stage and this is how it went down to\nUh [noise]\nI don't want anybody to\nA low\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and\nWearing a make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump so the laughter will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are American and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage\nAnd they have war and that's the kind of a revolutionary message that wealth and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize wide government title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the strict its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have it wrong ideas and if you're ... you know keep all of them\nUm and you're charged with sexual assault well it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases you're gender or your race you have to have the proper raised a proper gender but you also have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were my time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group thing thing all the arrangement how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how do the regular people stand up to the\nWell I think people ... to people like yourself or anybody who has a platform because they they live quiet lives definitely live lives quite desperation they're just looking around is there anybody who believes like I Do on my on my on a mountaintop were barbarians below and I think it's really important for people\nTo tell a woman reassure half the country that you're not crazy that you're the ones that are keeping up the positive traditions the United states and\nOf mark living on TALK radio I Am

will be over in ten days particularly well hopefully\nWe finished the year strongly that to the lord and I know that he is not so many of you are so many powerful ways we have been blessed in such a big way we are so grateful I Do know this and I don't want to say\nI'm looking at is what it is and I'm going to be truthful about it we are obvious this year again going to finish in the black we have never had a year in the raid two thousand nine was\nClose and I must admit I panicked a little bit to death and and I remember it well and then I was very um\nWell I was [laughter] I represented for my lack of faith because we came out just fine\nAnd uh this year is not going to be any different but um God continues to knowledge so many of you to give and you know I'm I've said this before but I'm so humbled\nWhen you all get to this ministry not mainly because I Can't believe I I Believe with all my heart that if you give to this ministry you're doing it because you believe in what God has done you believe all God is doing\nAnd one of these days you're going to get more powerful feel for exactly what he's done and what he's doing is we we uh get that out to you and him better and bigger detail\nBut it is amazing the work that he's doing here in the ministry and um but more importantly I'm humble because he's nudge you God has ... due\nTo be his instrument to keep us on the air and ... and to keep this ministry growing so he's not only raising up so many opportunities\nHe is\nSeen to it that he raises up the funds\nTo help us with all that as well to help us get to that place where he obviously would like us to get too so it's ... it's very exciting and uh we will be in the black this year of course we want to finish strong\nSo we've got ten days eleven days to finish a strong and I hope we do\nBut um I you know I\nI Know that I could get on the air say we're going to go off the air here and we're about out of money and we're going to be in you know a trouble and all those things and do you want to keep us on the air I could say all those things\nBut that would not be true we're going to be fine you're stuck with me for another year at least I'm and we'll ... we'll see but um we've got a lot of a big things coming up this year particularly as we prepare\nTo build out a new studio and of course the expense with that is far more than um I I if I shutter to even think about so we're we're doing that in face\nKnowing their God that God has raised up this opportunity I Believe this is of God to do it and I think he's going to take care of us so um we're not getting ahead of them are going to race or we're going to wait until we have all the money if we have to stop in the middle we will do that\nAre in weight but we feel very good about

the ...\nOr ... or ... of our ... nothing that we had our girl but I Wonder what ... ... ... ... on the\nCorner to give your opinion on on the banks girl\nSure yeah Johnson I Would say this um\nI think it's a fine idea to use an advisor\nI Would just be scared because of the amount of money it is I Would be a little nervous meet me would be all nervous for you about what you might end up with and that's a concern\nI don't I have a a there's a financial advisor that that I'd recommend or that you certainly\nCan I don't give that name out on the air because I you know I I don't want to I mean it's the only person that I Would recommend that I Would feel good that you could trust to do the right thing that's not going to go crazy when they see all that money you want to do more stuff to make themselves money\nUm but I Would I Would uh an email\nYou send an email to pat P. A. T. at financial issues died work\nPat at financial issues died or do give you the name of that person and contact information\nAnd I would I Would call them or or or talk to them\nUm all I Would say to you is don't worry about where they are it's irrelevant um you know don't look for somebody next door to you [noise] Ninety five percent of the time the statistics higher in that Ninety five percent of the time\nIf the person's that lives next door you're going to talk to him on the phone or they'll do the right thing by and that that's what I Would recommend\nUm if you didn't if you've started to feel a little more confident that you could work within our system here in financial issues then certainly certainly you can partner I think you can do it but you got to want to do it and and um I don't blame me a bit if you don't want to I don't hold that against you I think that's fine\nBut I think you could probably set this up so it would help you out\nI Would tell you this that whatever you do you would want to emphasize half of that money at least maybe or maybe not half but ... ... once you tie on it and you end up ... I Would say maybe\nA forty percent of it into income portfolio and actually take that income you may not need that income but I Would take it\nI Would save it and use regular old savings account or more importantly I'd give it away maybe have errors that you can start giving some money to uh maybe your church needs it\nOther ministries and and uh things that are you know that you want to support you can uh give it to if you don't need it but I Would do at least forty percent of it in in generating income\nSo hopefully that helps you Jonathan I I appreciate it a great question and again or if you email pat\nAt financial issues died where she can help you with that if that's something you want to do [noise] uh let me go to Rosemary or by the way we have a line open aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three and we go to Rosemary from Texas Hi Rosemary\nHi Dan I'm having a questionnaire have that you ... where a gentleman um I was taking care of our leaders in Ninety and he doesn't have family he left his home okay however the ... in a reverse mortgage\nNot dealing with this company now for about a year and a half trying to have options to buy that from that finally sent out an appraiser\nIt appraised that one thirty nine they said I had the option to purchase in whom\nAt Ninety nine percent of it but the prayed for mhm so my question to you\nFor ... so my question to you is I you know I have money in my dating I have about eighty and then I have my retirement which is about two hundred\nShould I pull some of it out of my retirement and out of my ... pay cash for it or should I um see about getting alone\n[noise] so are you still contributing to your retirement and now I\nAm I Am on a disability retirement\nOkay so I Would be concerned about\nPulling money out of your retirement because that's all you have and right when you own a house obviously you get the bills that come along with it you know that\nI'm ... so and you know something to go wrong the heater could blow up or new new for something and whatever it might be and you need to make sure that that you're able to you know do those repairs and do that kind of stuff as well um\nI you know but I I question I guess my thoughts are\nYour\nWhether you'd be able to get the loan that you need you know uh I Would\nI Do I get qualified or a hundred thousand I don't have any debt my home at eight for ours are paid why and I have no credit card I mean I just learned to\nLive right below my main now or what are you going to do with this house\nUm I have two options either I he his desire with for income to be generated on my future okay that was why why you'll be taking care of\nI could do that rent it out or I could turn around and sell it\nOkay\nWell uh it sounds like you wouldn't want to turn around and sell it because you can only make five percent on it if the appraisals right but you know the market better than the appraiser and appraisals always are under\nThe right to what you could get for it so you might do okay doing that but yeah if you're going to use it as a rental property I Would be okay with using some of your savings a finite seen what you can and should be able to be positive on a rental situation have a positive cash flow\nSelling the ... the the course of the concern is the risk is that you their market turned sour your tenet loses their job they can no longer pay the rent and you can't get a new tenant and you'd have to carry it that you risk\nThat's your own risk you know I mean so\nI don't know what part of Texas urine but most of Texas is pretty you know pretty strong from a housing and I had a rental markets standpoint so I Would be okay because that that would be something that uh you'd you'd want to look at it I'd be okay with doing that I wouldn't want to mess with your retirement if you can do\nAll kinds of great Oh thanks [laughter] okay thank you don't have a writer and in fact you I'm Glad you called aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three a four four seven or seven\nFifty five thirty three so um before I get to the next call because we're running out of time here where we're hold off a little bit\nFolks are people ask me all the time about real estate I'm just thinking about that as I was a\nTalking Rosemary you know it is it is a great opportunity generate income\nAnd ah had a young guy called me last week I was talking about hey I'm going to I'm thinking about owning several properties and buy properties now I'm young is that a good retirement but it is a good retirement plan it's great first of all you gotta wonder he was going to go the route which is a good one\nHe was going to go the route of just going to a a you know reorder and let them handle everything and just pay their permission every month and I think that's fine I think that's the best way to go\nBut look if you if you spend a hundred thousand dollars on the house\nAnd you're renting it yes you got to pay your mortgage I don't know what your mortgage would be on that but it's going to be probably somewhat less than\nYou are right and at some point in time you can be working towards the extra that you're getting your rain after taxes and insurance to put that back into the mortgage to start paying that principle in the mortgage\nBut once you get that paid off it's going to generate very consistent and very good income but you gotta want to be a landlord you got to be okay with that\nAnd that's the important part when you do something like that you got to keep that in mind\nAid for for seven or seven fifty
