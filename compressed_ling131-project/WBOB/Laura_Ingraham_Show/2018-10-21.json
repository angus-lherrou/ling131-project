Afternoon\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd for those reasons I Believe that last week's crash was algorithmic I told you was mechanical not fundamental and we got news this week evidence this week by the earnings that it was not\nFundamental we saw what was sold off we saw what got bought back first so it was in fundamental it was mechanical was algorithmic hit as it was it was you know you\nGot to remember that these Eighteen apps were created largely by these on line discount brokers they can't make any money any other way so they created these E. T. S. they sold them to you on the pretense that they're cheap and and good\nBut they're also tools that they and other people like them use to create these algorithmic trades\nThe stock market crashes that scare you and panicky when to sell a perfectly good stopped so that they can buy them back up at lower prices and you're standing around with your finger up your ear going what just happened\nWhere a stock market crash was dancer and then friday Monday and Tuesday or seven or eight hundred and far away then\nHey you guys keep buying those ATF from the from the discount broker from the vanguard from the fatalities from the eyes shares in the black rocks you keep buying a new chief enabling your worst nightmare\nAnd I'm going to explain that to you I'm part two of the show like nobody else does because I get money and they don't get money\nYou had a choice to prepare for this week based on what I shared with you last weekend or you could have waited for the silence from your current advisor to break you could have waited for the left to boot Becky ... quick to ask\nThe same question that she asked John Bolton four days after I already\nTold it to you on the radio and those reasons my friends are why this from is so dad gummed special I think about this stuff before most others do\nBefore you heard it on Fox News I may have already relayed a lot of it to our clients and my morning commentary and my other messages to my clients\nAnd I've discussed it in the annual review that we've been having with them that we've been having for the last three or four weeks old I'm exhausted what ... vanguard teeny what did they tell you about the meaning of the two presidents and November my guess is nothing my guess as I said hey by more mutual funds by more hope for more money in ACS\nI'd be surprised that after you meet with me personally you're not going to agree that it was the best time you've invested in your retirement ever [noise] you\nDon't have to say you don't have to you know just because your money is that one of these firms doesn't mean you have to stay there it doesn't it just because one of these guys might be your friend from church they don't even have to know you're leaving\nIt happens electronically I just in the piece of paper through in the money move from one broke her to the other that's it boom Don bought a bank you don't have\nTo stay there just because you have an account infidelity or vanguard at Wells Fargo\nPNC doesn't mean it has to stay there I can have that thing out of there and two days painless and you don't have to sell anything\nI don't know if you guys know that maybe don't know that you don't have to sell any of that stuff if you have five or ten mutual funds in it now and you want to\nJust switch 'em right over Bones Are stretched and then we'll look at him and tell you what we think you should do with them keep them sell them get rid of him whatever\nLarry fink with Larry think\nThat kids that kids grade school years must have been rough Larry fink of black rock made two very important points this week while he was being interviewed after after his companies' earnings report\nThe first thing that he said that was very insightful\nNo we already knew it was that Americans and that means you unfortunately that means you guys listen well maybe not you guys on the radio 'cause you guys are probably smarter than most of the public\nRight ... a lot of the public is out there still listen to the vitamin commercial on the other channel or they're out there at home depot doing whatever they do but you guys have invested time in your life your ear you've invested your time and listening to a really smart money show so probably there's an exception\nFor you but he says Larry fink a black rock says the first mistake first thing that's wrong with American economic system is that most Americans do not say nearly enough for retirement that's true it's a known fact\nLarry fink\nIs the or see a black rock and he gets paid to re site\nCommon knowledge a potential client came in to see me this week in his late fifties\nFirst words out of his mouth or I Want to talk about my retirement [laughter] just looked at him and I looked at his wife guys got two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the bank and I turned it in right in front of his wife and I said I Need to be talking to me about retirement do not use the R word in front of me\nUntil your portfolio starts with a number of sign and then one million dollars when you have one million dollars in the bank you can start talking to me about a modest retirement but until then don't use the R word in front of me\nAt fifty fifty five sixty years old I'm sixty six I feel like right now I can do this or another Twenty years and still be great I honest to God I feel that good\nKnock on wood thanks to the good genes\nMost Americans are clueless according to Larry fink and I agree when it comes to understanding how much money they're going to need for retirement how to get that money how to spend that money\nAnd somehow this damned mutual fund industry this on line discount brokerage industry has convinced you\nYou should be able to figure this out on line that it's a new it yourself projects\nBe able to figure this out on line that it's a new it yourself projects like something on home and garden TV the number one network\n\nWhat I Do is not a home and garden project it is not a do it yourself project\nJust not\nAnd you got to be honest with yourself and say I don't know what I don't know there might be things out there I don't know\nSecond biggest problem says Larry think\nTo America's retirement system and I know where Larry's going with this I told you been a listener to this show for the nearly ten or eleven years has been on I've already told you wear Larry thinking black rock want to go\nI've already told you where they want to go oh Canada\nI already know where Larry think wants to take that business if you think I don't know what Larry things business plan is I Know what Larry things business plan is\nLarry thanks business plan is to suck up to the government and convinced the government\nNow you're too stupid to manage your own money in your own four O. one K. but rather than having an increase in Social Security contributions year need to be forced to buy a bunch of lifetime income products call those annuities that his company wants to sell you\nHave the government forced you to make those purchases that sort of Larry think's going that's where I think the things going\nI might be wrong but I'd wager I'm right\nSo Larry fink says the second biggest problem with the U.S financial industry has your financial literacy is bad he thinks he can go to the government and say look those people listen to those people that are mindlessly dripping money the only reason that they're even surviving is because of these horrible target date funds that we created for them\n... God Forbid we let them by individual stocks these Americans are so stupid they're so financially illiterate they what they would have invested\nIn bad stocks thank God we put them in mutual funds and ATF sitting in for thank God you and me and the government force them into four one K. plants thank God the government wouldn't let them by Apple Facebook Amazon and Google which are harder life work\nThank God we put them in a bunch of target date funds earning virtually nothing\n\nAnd then the government's gonna turn around the Larry fink at black rock and fidelity in vanguard\nAnd American Funds and are going to say hey thanks for all of them damn political contributions to our party and you are right my friend Americans too stupid to manage their money what America needs as an annuity retirement\nJust exactly like that one in Canada and exactly like that one in Australia\nAnd exactly like that one in Shanghai\nAnd then Larry things can go no no they don't even like that what they need is one where black rock fidelity Lincoln Hartford vanguard potential they can all make a piece of they cannot get a therapy so they want it to be privatized so that they can get a piece of your retirement\nPie that's what Larry think of black rock I think things have you but you don't have to believe me you don't have to believe me because a client comes in to see me this week\nAm six

where was that bad somebody will be fired anyway so what happened to the good News Good news we we we call it out last week friday was good news market you know bounced back after Wednesday and Thursday\nTo the markets I think have lost a lot of confidence the markets are looking forward at the possibility\nOf either interest rate hikes or\nContinuing China trade wars they're looking at the chaos in the middle east they're looking at the world boycotting the Saudis and they're waiting to see if the Saudis get agitated and and and disrupt the oil by the world with with higher oil prices and and it's all too much\nTo make investors comfortable putting their hard earned dollars to work and the stock market and that's because\nYou as retail investors are trained to think about the stock market emotionally as if it's a person as if it's something to get you\nAnd it's not that's not what it is it's a collection of businesses and companies that offer their shares to intelligent investors who can calculate predict decide\nWhat what their future earnings might be and then they offer those future earnings to you at a discount\nBut somehow these on line brokers right the\nFidelity to the van guards the eyes shares the American some have these kinds of all convinced you that the stock market has some safe place were novices\nJust gamble their money every week\nIt's a bad situation it's a bad situation when when you sit here and you look at a stock that turned in by entering report like Netflix if you come to any other conclusion than the one I Am which I Can't tell you\n\nWhen when I asked myself how did that stock oh from for twenty three twenty and it goes back up to three forty seven to three Seventy five and\nI\nI was talking to the kids this weekend and I said you know what I'm getting ready to get rid of who I don't watch anything on Fox News are\nHonest to God there's not there's not a chance in hell that if drone power raises interest rates are quarter of a point there is not a chance in hell that if the child comes\nA enter into a tear for with the United states there's not a chance in hell I'm getting rid of Netflix\nFor twelve Ninety nine a month are you kidding me\nYou think I Want to sit around and watch network TV do you think I Want to sit around and listen to Sean Hannity Laura Ingraham Tucker Carlson\nAre you kidding me twelve Ninety nine a month\nI watch twelve Ninety nine I watched twelve dollars and Ninety nine cents or the value out of Netflix every hour and a half\nI get twelve dollars and Ninety nine cents worth of value out of Netflix\nI digress I'm off script I'm going to run long I can tell already with the markets have no confidence are bigger forces at play and these are the forces\nOf the stock market and unfortunately almost all investors who have been clients have disabilities in the vanguard no is it your mutual funds or your ATF Ellen value\nThey see the headlines and they don't know what to make of it I really have to stay on script I really my son going to I'm going to stay on the script what happened this week was logical and ... and was the logical unpredictable outcome of last week's sell off\nThose of us who know how stock markets work who have been doing this for some time now know that this week was at best a read\nOr at worst a\nWreath test of last week's Lowe's\nAnd that's normal think about it when someone falls through an iced over river you walk out on a river or a pond in Alaska and it's iced over it's not usually\nThat first tip toe onto the ice that sings so people put their foot down they tap their light there they don't put their whole body weight on\nThey listen to hear if it's cracking the looking to see a water bubbles up it's that second step it set heavier step where they put their full weight on the ice and that's what stinks them and\nThe markets are telling you they're not ready to put their full weight on a ...\nAre telling you they're not ready to put their full weight on a bet that all is well with China that all is well with the Saudis that all is well with interest rates at all as well with earnings when so much is not well\nThat's\nWhat I've read test of the market is all about and it's good because once\nYou know that that ISIS solid why don't you know that that reads test is held it up words and onwards to hire high rise so these are good things\nLet's look for a minute at the immediate cause of Thursday sell off since Monday the president of the White House have been trying to find a way to seemingly sound outrage that the Saudis and yet not to invoke their age which could result in sending oil prices sky rocketing\nRight as we head into the election and a couple of weeks I mean if you want to tick off some voters or make sure you lose a mid term why don't you see if you could see see how they like paying four dollars a gallon for gas at the pumps and we'd go All right just a moral and indignant on the Saudis\nThat's just what you're going to get you're going to get four dollar oil and so for all of Monday and\nTuesday and Wednesday and most of Thursday the entire world was canceling out on the Saudis big financial wing ... and it came to a Christian do this Thursday morning as you are working in secretary minute\nJan finally announces plans not to attend here's the news from Washington\nSecretary of treasury my nutrition has withdrawn from the future investment initiative conference in Riyadh next week after facing bipartisan backlash over his plans given the Democrats\nDespite the disappearance of ... a dissident Saudi journalist All right so we're all outraged\nWere all shocked somebody must pay yadda yadda yadda\nBut are we really going to sanction the world's largest and and and clearly most marginal supplier of oil and ally against the Iranians\nAre we really going to sanction them and pay four dollars a gallon for gas I don't think so\nI I don't\nThink so the Saudis are in a week place though they're forced to cancel the public offering of Saudi Aramco because there was no public interest and the DEA and they're realizing that their dream of becoming some kind of vacation spot for tourists\nAllah do by his in all likelihood not going to come to fruition anytime soon unless you feel the need to travel to Saudi first class and maybe you'd like to come home and the compartment department of a plane\nIn a suitcase in pieces so\nWhat's more likely is that any dispute any outrage any criticism of any kind is likely to lead to higher oil prices that will only exacerbate inflation and that will only give the fed a chance to raise interest rates over the president's objections\nAnd that will only make China more resolute about not making a trade deal and that will only pick off Peter Navarro even more and that will only outrage the president even more in the circle of stupid goes round and round\nAnd that's what was going on this week but in reality\nMy friends and this has nothing to do with most of the great stops that we own for our clients right\nLast week while you guys are out panicking maybe or you guys are buying and holding your ATF senior mutual funds I was trimming\nVarious stocks that we are on\nRight those stocks that I thought had exposure to China that I thought had interest rate exposure stocks that I thought had exposure to rising wage pressures that needed to borrow money from the fed those kinds of stocks are gone from our portfolios\nI Hope very few if any industrial now and that's fine with me even as I see them bouncing back a little bit on friday because I don't think that battles over\nAnd I I saw them all begin to report you know this week\nYou saw a report you saw fast and all you saw attack strong you saw a handful of and report higher costs wage cost material costs declines in sales wage pressures and if you want to own those kinds of sectors of the market and say well at least on diversify well that's fine if your money ... be my guest\nAs a general observation nothing going on and\nSaying land matters or who the hell to the shares an eye on for our clients and ask for chopping guys up and putting them into suitcases Irene manager attention to the NBC TV show blacklist which I told you about a year and a half ago when I first started watching it and I've\nSeen all the up I've seen all of this suitcase chopping up nonsense before not one time not one time of all the bodies that they chopped up on blacklist did the I did the apple watch leak

board in question so I Know a little bit about you before I get to the meeting this article is by Jack ... is too long I have to digest it into excerpts for you\nThe CFPB industry proponents and their creators he says the online brokerage industry like to argue that mutual funds\nHave been performing the same index sector style aggregation as ATF for the past Ninety years they argue that ATF or just a better cheaper format\nAs a as a mutual fund same thing as a mutual fund they argue only they're better and they're cheaper and that industry is lying to you ATS are in no way the same as a mutual fund\nMarket structure experts point out that ATF such as the SBY which is the U.S and the five hundred are not dissimilar from equity indexed futures\nPlots argues that neither the mutual fund nor the equity indexed future is illustrative for comparison to eat the apps and I agree they're not\nThe same they're not the same\nI mean come on you guys are smart enough to figure this out if you're fidelity and you've got this great mutual fund why the hell would you\nCreate an ATF does the same thing for a less\nWhy why would you I mean I I think as they want to give their stuff away I don't believe it not for a minute so my question is is a mutual fund and is an ATF are they the same thing and the answer is no\nBecause that's selling that you got on Wednesday and Thursday of last

radio show with Laurie font no and today we're talking about the power of passive income because it allows us to live where we want and invest where we want\nAnd we spent the first segment talking about the little bit about Laurie Ann and her history and moving around for jobs and never really being able to be where you want to be because something is dragging you elsewhere in order to make money and if you can create\nIncome that that cash flow that it's coming in every month without you working in that business or working very little in that business it gives you tremendous freedom to live wherever in the country you want to live close to the people that you love\nAnd the things that you like to do and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie\nWe've been working with a variety of of national uh folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now wait we launch our national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works and and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\nSure well you had mentioned in the last segment how we don't expect people if they are in a market it's not conducive for cash flow property and for investment buying whole property\nWe don't expect them to give up their life in their job and move away from family to go move to a an area of the country that that that meet the model and so\nThat's why we teach people but you can do the model in any city that make that on the market make and so we we teach them the price point you've got to do two things in order to end that outside of your market and analyze whether or not you're a market is a good one to invest that are not\nSo I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices are home prices are out of out of the sky high\nAnd they go through the roof they're with their home prices at in order to get a nice little that either and I will be a little bungalow you could pay half a million dollars for that\nAll wet price went market doesn't support being able to pay for the fences on a hold of that a lot better off than it doesn't make sense to actually do that in that area\nThat that that's pretty simple what normally we'd look at the average price of the house what it's going to upgrade or on the market\nOn the weekends generally ballpark look at that and say well what would probably in order for this like a good investment property wouldn't need to be about one percent of the price of our house so he's got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollar house that you're going to purchase order position by on hold for cash flow\nYou'd want to consider that you need at least seven hundred dollars a month for rent\nAnd the people in that area are paying that amount well then that means that the house is too high priced for the model\nDo what we do we look for areas that great if it happens in your own backyard because\n... give us in a bad or more familiar with the neighborhood we're familiar with that which which areas are good and bad so to speak but the thing is is that we can always not in our backyard and another city\nOr another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market\nPretty or another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market and the what the rents are are we can look at rental calm you can even find that if you you use search just a normal Web site like realtor dot com or or something like that the what rental homes are going or in the area\nAnd then look at what price as a whole they're selling for and then you can put that one percent will be whether or not it like that\nSo um you get your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics\nYou might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance or something on your old that that's in the area and see what the insurance rates are going for that you can start calculating what benefits would be a for that property\nTo see how much that the expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check your credit will be painful though once you apply the same principle to end market you can find a good markets and invest it\nAnd if he can't find um something you know lots of times people get stuck because they want to invest in their own area\nAnd is so many many people are living in areas like you say where the the numbers really don't work out well for rental property which is why many of us live in areas that don't have a lot of renters in the area\nAnd but as they expand out from from where they live they can find many markets usually in a variety of states\nAcross the U.S where it makes sense and maybe there's some on the east coast and the west coast where your numbers are just so high that when you're charging four or five thousand dollars a month for rent\nYou're you're into a dynamic in the market that's that's difficult to as a landlord it takes you longer to find tenants even though people may have higher incomes they also have higher\nHigher expenses and so\nThey they get into a situation where\nYou have their traditional tenants taxes\nAnd and toilets where they're really looking at appreciation so maybe you could talk a little bit about our model and how we look at appreciation of as being the cherry on top instead of the foundation of the investment strategy\nExactly well well we all loaded real estate is and appreciating are so appreciation though is I think on the cake and you don't want to go into it a a deal thinking that it's going to appreciate because that that of a speculative nature\nWe don't want to speculate on anything we want to run good from numbers and I'll tell you as long as their property and the price point to to ah to afford\nTo to make a profit off the rent the appreciation shouldn't shouldn't come into play that just simply what ...\nWhat you get in the by an old so for instance if you work you add\nIf ... if you go into a a market and it happened to be\nA let's say a hundred and under two hundred thousand dollars and you look at the market will say well you know prices are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating\nOur ... and and you would want to still not go in for ... that mostly people are just going to speculate on that and then they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every deal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThe fundamentals of the market that prevent us from repeating the past and that's really what Laurie is here to talk to us about today is\nMastering the fundamental so we don't repeat the past and being able to live where we want and invest where we want and that is the power of passive income this is Len Merle and Laurie ... now on the ... radio show in a moment we'll be back with

... before you get into a property\nAnd that's that's that's a powerful concept yeah and and ah I I to share a puzzle that the lone wolf\nA reputation that real estate investors have because we require such big teams in order to succeed you know you've got you've got your lenders your insurance agents you've got your contractors your handyman to trade shear refers your foundation folks your\nPlumbers and your electricians and it sounds like a big team to put together but it is not that difficult to put that team together\nAnd holding them together if you do what what we learn to do from Dell right which is to treat people while you pay your bills\nYou have good communication you're educated and so you know what you want to do and you can speak with them in an educated way then

talk about time getting to know the market at you and I went through an exercise in Las Vegas where we looked at property and in\nAbout an hour we got a handle on the market we learned some things that just delighted us and we we actually had a lot of fun together evaluating property and we found out wow you know insurance is a lot less in Las Vegas that it is in Texas cities\nAnd you know every area has different things you know Phoenix has been a really fun to market to evaluate I've enjoyed learning about Kentucky and um yeah we're looking at different areas in St Louis and Kansas City and of course it Lana we've been\nMembers who have been investing in Atlanta for quite some time and I'm In Detroit since the recovery has been some amazing opportunities as well and each one of those markets has its own\nIts own flavor and so you may have a little bit more expense in one area like they may be a little bit higher and property taxes but their insurance is lower some states are lower in both\nUm and so there are a focus of our attention right it's so as we go through this all look at\nWhere do we want to invest personally where what market do we find exciting what market do we find interesting and where did the numbers work and that's something that I I hear you talk to members about all the time is you can't fall in love with those homes the numbers have to work for you\nAnd said Laurie you know when we when we talk about the numbers that is a way to level the playing field across the country right\nOh absolutely and and that's one thing that we tell people that
