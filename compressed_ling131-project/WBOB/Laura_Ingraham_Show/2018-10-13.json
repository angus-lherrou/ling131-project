I'm not writing all my gosh it ... it does not need to be stage fright but that was as I was driving in this morning I was thinking about\nAn interesting correlation to staging staging is kinda like\nCorrelation to staging you know staging is kind of like ... match dot com you know buying a house is matching a buyer to seller correct match dot com is matching\nTwo people together that won't come together right on match dot com you're putting together a profile match what the MLS lifting is the multiple listing service listing is\nLike ... okay a profile but also a match dot com you put pictures right has pictures is what an initial attraction is to somebody right so when we stay home\nAnd show pictures it is the initial attraction\nYeah right yeah so if it's done right it's the attraction and just like match dot com if you look at the picture and the picture of that other person\nDoesn't do anything for you you're flipping through the next one you're done\nThat's true that's true and then some people go through a lot of effort to make their pitch or really beautiful or hand phone right because they want to be selected that's kinda what homeowners have to do with their house\nSo we spend a lot of time with people telling them what to do to make their house look great and sometimes it involves staging so a couple of these houses were vacant and that's like you know this is an odd correlation you\nOr are you not happy that you're two grandchildren are coming over and as I'm saying that you already have ... [laughter] that is\nIs a big smile come across Angela's face and I love my grandchildren and you're going to love them coming over and ... seeing them dress up you're going to have a camera with you and you're going to love walking around and walk around with them okay\nSo I Can't help it [laughter]\nSo I think they're in the oral hire we use here with them\nAgain and then when they get all sugared up [laughter] hey go home with their mother [laughter]\nI Know that like all grandparents parts of the callers uh two two to eight to five five and guess what percentage of folks are going to dress up their home yes All right er decorate their home okay now what happened to interest rates this week\nI think I can see [laughter]\nIt's a really really tiny the thirty year conventional rate rose\nEighteen hundreds of a point to four point nine percent\nThis time last year it with three point nine one y'all that's a seven year high at four point nine zero if you're thinking about buying you need to get off the fence and by before he gets so high you can't afford the home you can bet you want to buy\nThe Fifteen year rate it also rose\nFourteen one hundreds that's what I'm saying it right for pain or kind of hard interests of a point to a four point to nine percent in this time last year it was three point to one percent about how it's up a full point\n... ... and it happened the thirty year V. A. N. F. A. J. right\nWell let's say it was an changed at four point five percent and a five year adjustable rate mortgage it's still a great deal if you only plan on being in your home for five years or less\nIt rose six one hundred percent to four point zero seven this time last year was that three point one sex\nWow yes their rates are up if you're thinking about buying get better do it\nYou know some people are thinking well I'm not going to buy rates are up prices are up why don't I just rent and I said that\n... that's a wrong thing to do why don't I just rent so I Want to tell you have a caller do we have a caller we said before you start something new to take the caller yes we do have a caller so I don't have the callers name on my computer screen but a good morning color\nGood morning can you hear me yes I can very good Jonathon Jonathon I enjoy a couple of weeks a couple of weeks ago I called and I pretty much sort of the in the middle of your newly married that I agreed with our\nSo\nAngela yesterday it was a red letter day I agree totally with you about horrible Allah we\nKept egging holiday I Can't stand it [laughter]\nYeah I I mean I'm not anti hey get are anything but a matter of fact I Would vote for the executive somebody [laughter]\nA matter of fact I Would vote for the taking ticketed somebody [laughter] but uh Halloween you can have is I don't know it doesn't make sense to me [laughter] ah\nSo what I like about it then tell me what you don't know about it\n[noise] the candy it's it it's bad for kids than it garbage yep uh there's too much these days there's too much danger\nI mean the only way it can be safe and doing this kind of thing is they go to one of these communities sorted deals right and then\nI don't know it even then there are weirdos out their true yeah and the costumes\nAre used one third Spencer now and then you throw them away because you can't not like to get where I'm at school\nRight [laughter] right\nSo I don't know you know that I think it's just stupid\nAll around hey agree with you Jonathan I Know yeah and I'm Glad to be on the same page with the Angela\nMeets him meets the eye happy with you this week instead of mad at you like I was the best for yeah yeah [laughter]\nYou know uh I have to go against our cars the men the men have to stick together because the the arrows are coming from every direction\nWhy it's okay because we are we are a couple and we stick together we have some things but we are still together\nYeah and that's I don't know what he's saying about men need to stick together but you know here's what happens when men start sticking together than the women start sticking together and we are just a lot stronger than you guys I don't think it's in your best interest [laughter] maybe there's a lot going on there is that yeah isn't it [laughter]\nSo do you have I guess I'm ...

[laughter]\nThat's funny well employment is actually not one of them what do you mean\nSorry what you do for your job is not a a factor is not one of the things that is a in the housing and urban development fair housing act what you do for your job\nSo are you saying that get turn away a drug dealer you could [laughter] stuck in as long as you treat people fairly so yes you can fail that whatever job they have is not it's something that we can discriminate against\nYes and you can do it by the way by the number of children so if you have a two bedroom house and they have six kids oh that\nThat can't happen there's laws against that idiot two heads to a bad meaning to head to toe bedroom\nYeah so you can do it by their credit because that's not a\nWriter indicator of whether or not they're going to pay right there and read it their income\nThose types of things you can't do it by their you know their national out nationality what country they're from\nThose types of things you do by whether they drink and I\nKnow\nThat's ...

hour discussing all the great and wonderful things that happened this week that should take about five minutes and then there's about another fifty left for all the other things that happen this week\nWhich is not exactly true it was just kind of a speed bump along the road to success if you want to be a real optimist so\nWho all our regulars welcome back so happy that you tune in every week

we'll\nWe'll talk about all kinds of things that hopefully some of which will be new to you and maybe explain a little bit about what's going on\nNow those of you who've listening to the show a long time understand that the number one rule of the show is that when the phone rings the caller goes to the front of the line good morning Deb\nGood morning how are you a weather\nMan would you open the door known it just feels refreshing doesn't it\nAfter that he is I get it and they make a great lesson I've got a question yeah why why why did the right in interest rates confiscated my kids to go\nOh that's a wonderful question well it it actually causes it to go down yeah so ...\nWhat did I say yeah that'd be okay though we knew I wonderful weather look look at the\nLook at the history of rising interest rates over the past couple\nOf years at Trump's spin around and the market is up over six thousand points so what caused what if there's a reaction and then there's an analysis and there's an accident that if you think about why an interest rate would go up its because things are good\nBecause they're trying to control inflation keep\nThe employment at the right level and so on\nSo they raise the interest rate and what does that cause a little panic in the minds of some investors because they don't really put two and two together and say well they wouldn't have done that unless it was good news\nSo they have a little bit of a sell off and then people think about it and come back and it goes up to the next level and it happens again so the answer to your question is it's a reaction that's all it\nHas nothing to do with common sense logic or long term anything that we were other people know that for other\nPeople react to react\nAnd always happens that's what the market does it has a pendulum it goes back and forth sometimes first\nAs always happens that's what the market does it has a pencil and what goes back and forth sometimes very slowly sometimes very quickly\nThat look what happened in the market this week which we'll talk more about after the call there was a sharp ... action reaction that took place this week very sharp thinking about it now if you're young and you're borrowing money you don't like it because the\nCar loan you get the mortgage is take out it's\nGoing to cost you more but if you are my age and your net saver and now we're done buying cars and houses and all that you're going to love it because then on you're safe money over on the side you're going to be earning more interest\nThat's why we have been railing against these virtual zero interest rates for ten years because nobody was rewarding the\nOr you just did a wonderful\nIt was a Ida it all was\nSurprises me you know we get that feeling once in awhile Adam and I usually experienced the same thing at the same time\nWhere we think we need to do an email we need to do a correspondence to clients and friends because this kind of thing\nIs not ordinary enough for most people to just ignore\nSo then we react to it so when I react to it and start growing up and do a little research\nI'm the one who always winds up surprised that's what I Love doing about these that's why my trivia questions are usually things I didn't know when I started I Love finding things that I Would maybe not otherwise go look for\nAnd that's what happened and this one and I think it did help a lot we've got some nice comment some feedback on it so everybody out there know that in the fourth quarter of the show I Am going to read it to everybody and show you how we think about things and how we hope that our clients will think about things that\nI bought our news cycle we're into and everything is all we're our news break or a national show or whatever it is nice it leads a brat look really did happen not one big sensationalize right and then from there yeah\nI agree that item this week I heard there was like oh I bet you were starting with all these ... coming up\nI'm going through those certain [laughter] walk on our on top of this one Marjah we worked on that this week the hell\nDid you happen to get the ... all one version\nI don't think so no I don't believe I Would suggest you Google Jerry ... age on and then not okay\nIt is it is wonderful\nBecause it was put together very for actually buying them any further than the historical facts and you start seeing who is supporting something why are they doing\nYeah that's the important part you know\nHere's one that we all this guy and fortunately there are going to be a strong now an item on the ... have for us here locally\nCo good I'm not a Duvall voter so I won't get that one but I but I'm Adam will and we we've had some discussions with people about this one and I think that's a fantastic thing for\nAsking the people I just wish the public would become more educated before they vote on it so whatever you can find ... will be happy to um talk about that in fact Adam being a Duvall county border to probably take a good look at the world in ... before the election will have him some up what he can learn between now and the\nViolent or get more education in the remainder of the hour thank you very much okay Martha ... call\n\nGood morning Larry hey guys how you doing we are fantastic how are you\nUh you know same routine just doing last Saturday we're looking to my\nShow works for me and we like to hear it [laughter] well what does it take a stab at the trivia cute as I'm\nTorn between two numbers but I'm going to guess the lower than that I'm going to save for\nA maybe he should've guessed though [laughter] it's a good try that oil man\nThat was one of the knowledge that came to mind when I first heard the question too I actually ended up getting the right one but it was it was one between two for me and I and I almost got that\nAnd like every like every good horses player knows you got to be close until you finally get that rare so your bracket into them very nicely\nYeah definitely and and I just like to say one more thing too as far as I recall what I'll I'll watch you know I don't have you guys dollars at the market but I did watch it every day it's kind of keep my eyes on it and it seems to me that every single day that that happens the following day balance right back\nI'm it's not all was one day it's linked to the next necessarily but you're basically right you don't go from a thousand to twenty six thousand in thirty seven years unless you get over these things because otherwise would be back it up thousands of they\nAnd many times ... accounts\nThings because otherwise wouldn't be back at a thousand today\nIt many times Larry it bounces back within a very short period of time like ... like less than a week if you remember ... yet um that wasn't a couple of summers ago the vote came in the market drop\nSomething like eight hundred points and on the lower level back then and within three days I think it was back how 'bout overnight on November if twenty sixteen yeah there you go to the futures I'm On the on election night tanker absolutely tanked and then by the time the market opened it was neutral and by the end of the day was up substantially yeah\nYeah I'm just thinking even just just the time period that you're talking about just the beginning of the year it seems like almost ... back but but even if that's all changed over you'll\nListen to their houses back listen to the rest of the show there's a lot of lot of stuff coming up about that very topic\nI'll be ... thanks guys thanks for calling back alright Cheryl I bet I know what you would like [noise] um I Want to go for it [noise] five no\nWe're learning [laughter] sorry about that they're either [laughter] we appreciate it dry and those eggs for less than they are laughing about it All right folks you got your bracket tightened down a little bit more yeah All right Adam more on the market this week yeah\nSo the what caused what cause when they want to go back and talk about that a little bit more I think\nMarket finally believed fed chairman because he's in the last ... I think when you really what it really boils down to a lot of nerve I Know I that listen we've had three Allan Creighton Greenspan clones in a row\nAnd they never say anything they talked some forever to say that I talk but nothing factual comes out it's a bunch of\n... the hedging their own bats\nAnd Powell just said look we're going up and the market said oh I kind of believe that and freaked out\nBut he at least uses a word that we understand ... normalization yeah and he's right ... not a normal condition for an economy in good condition people know it is that right or interest rate policy\nYeah it hurts too many people specifically the ones you want to hurt the least what your your elderly who need Social Security increases by the way if you hadn't heard that number got released and it's the highest it's been in my belief ten years two point eight percent next year yet so thank goodness is all I can say\nFor those of you who are as skeptical as I Am because I've trained you're so well over the last sixteen years we all naturally assumed that they're going to take it away from us on Medicare right\nProbably no no I looked it up this morning and much to my wonder meant\nThe average increase of two point eight percent for the average person who's about thirty nine dollars yeah I heard that and the ... Medicare be is going up one dollar and Fifteen cents you are actually going to have an increase in take home pay this year\nWhich is that about four hundred a villain or four hundred bucks a pack\nAnd that's the average and the average them a lot of people were had long experience like I have or something the tone of half again or double average so down for the for the longer serving or higher earning people out there you're going to get a really really good\nRaised except of course there's always those increases that you get when you make more than the base amount of money but they're even the worst case there is only about three dollars and fifty cents a month sorry everybody's going to be well off better off\nThis there's a new year so that's a good thing\nIt is and there were some other good news out there despite a eleven hundred and seven point drop this week but that was still up two and a half percent this year part of that came on the bounce rally friday but it is also a it's also the index that his up the least this year the major index that's up to lease the S. and P. is up three point five and then that that could still up eight point six percent\nAnd guess what else if you go back exactly a year from friday on the doubts up ten and a half percent\nYou know so there there is it this isn't it's not all doom and gloom out there some other indexes like the rest of the two thousand or just barely cling on to gains for the year but all the major indexes are solidly in the black the other good news is that stocks are in major major oversold territory\nAnd ... trading almost four times below it's fifty day moving average and why is that good news because it starts to look pretty attractive at those levels\nThe valuations look a lot better than they did last week even buying opportunity exactly so that is that it's not all bad news like many other things in in finance in politics there's it's a double edge sword\nCome I tell you about feeder shifts of little ramp from this week to [noise]\nIs it is easy to joined the ranks of the ... David Sims Yellen's Cruz looms Schiller is the people I all was admonished people when you see their name on something just bypass it don't read it you're wasting your time Peter Schiff was probably better known than most of them is the head of the euro for specific capital but\nHe did the nearly impossible this week when you step right up and joined the ranks of I Will never read him again so you have a chance I'll tell you more about that one fact\nAnyway I got a lot to do with the half of the turn will get in touch with him and mice and a bunch of other things that don't go anywhere we will be right back to sit down with a mental lowest [noise]\nWell yeah it's happened quite a bit and that's just this year so the panic level far exceeds what it's worth although it's a perfectly normal human response in my humble opinion\nSo you are correct six times\nI Will live that yeah\nWell put you on hold and we'll get your stuff and that and we'll send you a little something or other\nOkay what are we got them anyway\nWe actually have a twenty five dollar gift card to the homestead restaurant and ... and it's it's really good if you haven't been there yet cool All right well have fun and thanks for the call\nThank you good six times even worse than Thursday yeah there's that felt pretty bad\nAnd then it did well it didn't help that came after Wednesday\nIt did not help but those two days with the thousand foreigners I remember those like it was yesterday and thankfully your memory can let those things fade back a bit [noise]\nThe uh the economic big data this week was surprisingly negative as well it wasn't that bad but there wasn't a lot of positive I'll put it that way that even small business optimism came in below expectations and that's kind of been the shining star of this recovery uh since Trump got elected\nUm there was a couple of inflation reports one was on target one actually missed coming in a little bit lower than expected but it's still showed an increase in inflation so it's still kind of made a little bit of a call that negative yeah\nI'm next week a little bit more there's a bunch of 'em there's a bunch of 'em housing reports a retail sales comes out Joel and some other I think there's about Seventeen reports a little more active next week and it'll give us a better\nPicture of an earnings season starts next you know then then the next two weeks after that\nIt's really an full bore so we'll see if all these doomed Sayers are anywhere near correct yeah sure well my guess is there'll be off a mile\nOwned by the way that the good news is the bully sentiment for investors dropped suddenly this week that is a good thing because the crowd is generally wrong definitely fight\nSo let's talk some some policy ought to even though we don't do that very often or try not to anyway\nThe the reason that people care so much about things like Supreme Court justices is because when you can't get something through by\nA legislative process you try to ... through a court\nAnd that is what's been happening for a long long time\nWhere it's not much different in Florida Florida's just a microcosm of the country as a whole and so there are some judges on the ballot I Am not going to speak to them because frankly I have not finished my research on them\nBut over the decades I've lived here what we have found is that Florida's constitution has a major flaw and that has his way too easy to offer amendments to the people yes and it does not have a truth in labeling law city hind\nVery off running in his worded would double negatives and things like that that make something sound one way when it's really another this is their way of sneak it in and it is so bad there got so bad that it even\nHad we even had and passed an amendment regarding the treatment of pregnant pigs\nThat is the most common example but there's ... there's actually more agree just examples of things that the people have passed that are more harmful but that one just sounds funny says we add it all the\nTime and it shows you the the pure um silliness of this whole thing it's a terrorist important\nSo I'm going to go over what we're actually asking this time and by the way there is a retired Florida Supreme Court justice who is suing the state to make them stop bundling these ideas together and I could not be more on his side\nAmendment one is to raise the homestead property except exemption for by another twenty five thousand homes worth more than a hundred thousand when something is a tax cut which this is where\nPeople like me guess who's going to support it\nI Do but I Do [noise] amendment to this proposal caps [noise]\nTen percent increases in property taxes on non homes that we've asked save save our homeless back in the nineties what's kept your your homes that are probably at three percent annually\nThere is no cap on the other [noise] uh this can be called controversial but if you call it controversial to me I won't listen [noise]\nWe kind of disagree on this one guy no go ahead do but anyway I like the fact that there's going to be a cap on it because if it came out of control government I Would personally like to see them lower than ten but that's not an\nAmendment three films [noise] big boulders the rights supposedly to decide and for the casinos are going to go because we're right on the brake I'm going to come back and tell you about a misleading proposal don't go anywhere stay tuned we'll be right back to the man we financial our\nSo you need to find a plumber to

high before but for those of you who I knew a it to the show ... maybe that's the first time that you hear that there is a new truth about cancer and then with that for a long time it's just that\nWith the help of Thai and Charlene bowl injure\nThey're creating and we are creating critical mass I've said this before a loan we're just one person that together where an overwhelming majority and this is a great example good at the truth about cancer dot com and to learn more about how many of us have experience\nBeing told that someone you love or someone you know maybe even knew that you have a cancer diagnosis oh only to be rushed into chemotherapy only to be rushed into surgery only to be to lose your power and give your power away\nTo someone who has something to gain by doing chemotherapy radiation all these different treatment\nPerhaps maybe today you will learn a new truth truth that will need you to inform choice but today we have\nCharlene and tribal injure and I am so grateful that they're going to be sharing their story about the truth about cancer and\nWill teach us what we need to know about cancer the history that treatment and prevention and since it at our sole purpose in life to give and receive a lot of knowledge I Am so grateful that tie and Charlene are here to do just that welcome to them different radio show\nAnd you got to be honest I couldn't hear you guys know and I couldn't hear you well let's start from the very beginning I'd I don't know who would like to\nShare a little bit about your background and\nOf course we I I Know about your background but there may be someone that knew that had heard about the truth about cancer so let's start with you and then we'll bring Charlene and share her story as well\nWell I'm sure I certainly had it was really out and we were were ... we we were learning\nThe truth about all these different treatments that were available that we didn't know about and then we started digging deeper and found out the corruption of the the medical system in place\nAnd that most doctors wouldn't even he chemotherapy because they knew it was harmful another family member and I mean God deeper that's where the anger really started for I think and we couldn't understand how can anybody knowingly do this and participate in this one\nAnd so it was our goal from that point on that really propelled us\nInto writing the books and doing a documentary so that other people could learn the trees that we weren't\nAfford it at the time that we're facing now I noticed it says so that others wouldn't have to be due into the system and forcing bullied into the tree instead of actually work\nAnd let me follow up man I was on the\nNot only the best show on colleges that that may or may not even do chemo they're diagnosed with can prescribe the other thing that was really shocking was the way the medical doctors if they use treatments that are that are on a\nCruise they're actually punish they're persecuted um there was a book that I read I remember back in the mid nineties it was barred I'm often ... by making who's called healing comes to crime\nAnd it was it we we began to learn that if you you were on a cruise treatments you can literally lose your licence in the United states where you might be forced to leave the country to practice medicine so\nYou know that was something that really got under assume because\nDoctors are supposed to be healers writer personally teacher but not close to ... and they should be able to employ whatever healing morality works whether or not we're not in the United states has to be approved mode allergies and unfortunately it's harder to get approval process is the almighty dollar I'm\nOne of the things that were you know recently learned I just traveled to Asians you are\nAnd we're losing another documentary next year coal eastern medicine or we would seven countries in seven days\nAnd we interviewed doctors what they're doing in Asia to treat cancer and the thing that's different there is that in most countries they're dockers or just allowed to use whatever works there is not an official treatments that they have to stick with countries around the exceptional horse but the four corners\nSeven countries we went to doctors can use whatever works because dealing with patients is the key but unfortunately the honest they have to treat a patient with an approved treatment you he was not really the goal it's using your recruit treatments and I think the reason is because that lends itself to more money in the pockets of big pharma\nYeah yeah and you know we've lost a lot of people in our family will actually my husband's family with my family but ah and it's and it's it's helpless you see and it's not just the\nThe medical um industry it's also the\nThe media and the um the people that have bought into the stories that we're being told that because um we're we're we know that doctors know that they are pretty much they have to offer what they're told that they need to offer but we\nI and I can tell you with my sister in law um when she had it um she wanted to do alternative\nShe wanted to do holistic and she was on her way of doing that and releasing some of the the the traumas in her life and um she was bullied into I'm trying\nChemotherapy and radiation but she really actually wanted to do something different and um so as a result we lost her to\nThe side effects of chemotherapy and radiation as is the truth for those people and I know and this is what bothers me is that we've lost so many people to cancer and it's become customary\nTo lose someone to chemotherapy and radiation but if we lose one person to alternative health integrated functional holistic then all hell breaks loose on with any of you like to address that or either of you\nYeah well listen I'm Sorry could you repeat the question I miss it\nYes with either one of you like to address the fact that we have\nUm you know that we buy that that the industry the the the medical industry loses we lose a lot of people to the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd nobody says anything it's it's normal it's okay but if we lose one Irish and to an integrative functional holistic way of healing then all hell breaks loose what you'd like to address that yeah\nYeah absolutely and that's a great point that one of the points of anger and that we had to go through in\nJail it back on time\nBut that that is strong all that and medical just send the current conventional medical system half if you look\nAll that and natural just send the current congressional medical system hand if you look on the FDA own website as an example they may live than pop reasons for yeah and one of them\nBy doctors and what they say with\nFor example properly prescribed pharmaceutical drugs are killing over a hundred thousand people\nPer year now and he gets around now and in a bad car nominate someone sank and they're in the hospital without even dying yeah we've seen swat teams come in farm they take away confiscate that now that she there is a number standard\nAnd and the fact is that the national treatments that nurse a body and target only cancers south yet there are\nSystematically not only be suppressed by like ... rice winter rain and rife with persecuted they they ruin your life that's one of many examples for\nAnother current living example persecution one of our very best friend Dr Brzezinski yeah she said she has not hiding the green open a man the\nFDA he's three generations up yesterday a shock to shore people just to treat them successfully with these treatments that are highly successful\nSo yeah that's a big they disconnected problem is that is why\nWhat you're really and what we're doing it so important to educate the people that don't yet now so that they can understand the persecution that happening within the system we really would like to rake his current system and rebel so that people could know the truth and as a result them\nAbsolutely time would you like to add anything to Charlene ... Charlayne said\nSure yeah seeing it in and Charlie mentioned around me is whether they admit a hundred thousand a year to draw the same room and they were properly prescribe that mind blowing if you think about it\nIt's it's like it's hidden in plain sight that we're drawing people\nWhen they're ... improperly taken but it's okay for him\nBut you go further than that I mean if you look at some of the therapeutic agents that are not used to treat cancer on the packages or\nWant to sign up maybe secondary cancers that are mixed or you know for instance with breast cancer drug secondary cancers that are listed on the answer or uterine cancer and cervical cancer\nSo it's like it's hidden in plain sight we're treating cancer with drugs that can cause cancer and where are you going to tell you they might cause cancer on the package insert again I mentioned\nThe double standard can you imagine if there were a natural treatments for cancer and you know Mike humorous getting rid of my hardest uterine cancer cervical cancer it wouldn't be that would they would they would destroy that company overnight\nYeah this happens regularly with with the industry was pharmaceutical industry specifically with cancer doctors have been\nLocked into this um do you believe two contradictory things I'm honored treats cancer Raleigh causes cancer that just doesn't make sense to\nYeah it doesn't make sense to us that we are told that this is what we have to do and we've been trained since birth to believe what our doctors our doctors know best and and doing the show tying Charlene what I've learned is that many doctors that are being honest on the show they said we really\nDon't know what we're doing we're we're we're learn to to to treat and we learned to\nPrescribe but you know

can play the stream from the last four episodes let's try and make\nNo money [noise] so Thursday was a ... it was an ugly ugly day if you woke up and you heard the news on Thursday morning news was that morning\nWhen I was the news about rising bond\nYields yields\nAnd the news that China is implanting\nThe tiny buying chips and all of the government's computers and phones the iPhones the defense department's computers the Navy's computers all of the computers that we buy from China have a chip in them\nAccording to the\nBloomberg Businessweek article you would not have been surprised then on Thursday morning to see the market fall all\nDay I've been warning you all that I thought inflation could get out of control could get ugly ugly more on that\nLater in the show though I've been talking with you about the China trade war and about two or three weeks ago I warn you that the war had been downgraded\nDowngraded to a skirmish skirmish and then it was likely to be downgraded even further to us back to is that\nBecause the president said he loves China he loves president gee there'd be there'd be a mess\n\nBut on Thursday we find out that China's putting computer chips by chips are in every electronic device will use at home and then the government that the government uses presumably to I don't know launch nuclear weapons\nI don't know to start a war\nI don't know every every every computer that the government's got got got secret Chinese chips in them\nChinese chips not ... ... so let's get to that story\nAnd and the and the story of according to Sean Hannity is good men and women\nOf the FBI you know how Sean I says well I'm not talking about the bad men and women of the FBI like Jim call me\nBut they're still working day every day working guy at the FBI the good guys are really good guy they really do a good job\nAnd yet Hillary is still an indicted I don't understand the story [noise] I don't understand what makes them so good but maybe I'm wrong\nHere's a China spy chip story from Bloomberg Businessweek and this story this story could have\nHuge ... stock market implications\nAnd twenty Fifteen Amazon Amazon began quietly evaluating a startup company called elemental technologies are potential acquisition to help with a major expansion\nOf their of their streaming service streaming video service that we know today as Amazon Prime video\nElemental technology had help stream the Olympic Games online and it helped communicate with the international space station and had ... and if funneled drone footage from the various wars to the CIA\n\nElemental national security contracts weren't the main reason for the proposed acquisition but they fit nicely with Amazon ... business\nSuch as a highly secure cloud that Amazon Web services is planning to sell to the to the CIA how many of you know that the CIA was going to host top secret information on the same crowd that you host pictures of your dog\nI knew that because I pay attention\nTo help with due diligence Amazon Web services which was overseeing the prospect of acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nThe first pass uncovered troubling issues prompting Amazon Web services to take a closer look at elemental main product the expense of servers that customers installed in their networks to handle video compression\nThese servers were assembled for elemental by super micro computer now my old company supercomputer super micro computer uh San jose based company commonly known as super micro\nIt's also one of the world's biggest supplier of mother boards mother boards are the big board inside of your computer that upon\nWhich hits all the other junk\nRight\nIn late spring of twenty Fifteen elemental\nElemental staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario now this is good right\nSo elemental is going to send samples servers to Ontario so that's some company in Ontario can determine if those servers that are going to the CIA are safe\nSo we're now we're now we're now outsourcing national security\nTo the milk sucking Canadians who wanna let us sell a milk until this week the powdered milk to be accurate okay so I don't know why\nWe're outsourcing our our our national security to some company\nAnd Canada hoarding milk\nThat stood on the servers mother boards the testers found a tiny microchip not much bigger than a grain of rice that wasn't supposed to be part of the boards original design now the first thing I think all you people at home should know\nAbout the CIA and the fear Federal Bureau of idiots and the so called good men and women who can't even find a cause to indict Hillary is that in the business of examining computer parts right\nLike if you're intel or your applied materials or kale like ten corps or your um land research\nWhen they inspect the computer chip they're they're inspecting the way for that the that the chip is ultimately etched on their their engraving it down to ... there there is backing down to the nano meter nanometers level at whatever level is below nano meter\nAnd most of the city that I Do business and you pick the day you pick a time\nI'll send you an email on a map with directions to the office it's closest to you and that's all you have to do a little while later\nYou're going to receive an invitation to register for the amazing Gemini private client portal involved as well as some basic on boarding questions it kind of need the government kind of like you to answer so I can make sure you're a real person\nThat kinda thing\nAnd then you just sit back and wait for the meeting to start\n[noise] so I'm Peter Navarro Peter Navarro\nWants to tell you that our being held hostage to Chinese steel\nIs the most important thing in the world we have to have our own\nNational sources Steele\n\nI Would tell you we need to have our own national source of semiconductor production of computer production of\nElectronics manufacturing\nSo now it's your choice choose me or choose Peter that moron Navarro because I Would argue to you we can always get steal from China we've got plenty of steel we can make in the United states\nBut what we don't have in this country is a reliable workforce that can manufacture high tech electronics and semi conductors we don't have a reliable source or we don't have a reliable logistics chain\nFor those items\nSo it's up to you to decide you can go after steel which is I don't know what thousands of years old or you can go after high tech electronics you tell me which one of those two jobs using pays the most\nSo let me see if I understand the story so far the according to Sean Hannity that good men and women over the FBI who still can't find a reason\nTo indict Hillary or Christine bubbles Ford or that idiot ... mosque for stock price manipulation they can't find a computer chip the size of an enormous grain of rice but the folks that apple\n\nCan I fear chai comes may have the keys to our nuclear systems are worse to our money the Chinese government didn't directly address questions about the manipulation supply chains safety they say in in cyberspace as\nAn issue of common concern China's a victim\nMeanwhile the FBI and CIA can't find a chip the size of a grain of rice on the mother board of the computer which is the equivalent of you finding a gigantic Goodyear Blimp\nIn your living room I may be wrong\nI digress Mardi please tell me there's a point to this ridiculous story please tell me that you've not made me listen to this incredibly long over my head boring story to make the point that China is buying on the please Marty telling me there's more to this radio program all\nThere is more yeah there is\n\nThis could be a serious there could be a serious retaliation justifiably that\nCouldn't markets so it will be interesting to see how the president manages to deal with China\nKnowing that they're spying on everything from your your Amazon Alexa all the way up to his aircraft carriers\nGot to be honest with you you know I got to be honest with you if this doesn't put price if if if listen if exposing\nThis story is saying that the Chinese hey we know what you did and we know how you did it if that doesn't bring them into the twenty first century\nWhere they can agree to cease and desist from this pattern of behavior\nIf this doesn't bring them to a trade negotiation that results in the end of this kind of behavior\n... maybe ...\nMaybe dumber than I think or maybe as dumb as I think\nHe is smart president has every right to break China over this this is an existential risk to the United states\nThis is an\nExistential risk to the United states and we don't have a supply chain or a manufacturing center in this country to replace the equipment that come from China and we don't have a ... we don't have a reliable partner\nIn Asia that we should be relying on not one computer\nThe defense department should be made by any company other than a one hundred percent American Company with one hundred percent sourcing in the United states and we're going to put US Steel and the damp pipes that we used to deliver oil or ...\nUS Steel and the damp pipes that we used to deliver oil or ... or liquid oil from Canada to the United states if that's got to be us pipe the computers need to be us computers\n\nTwo weeks ago I diagnosed the problem of Ilan mosque of Twitter fame\nYou know him as the CEO of Tesla that overpriced electric car that probably will never succeed because nobody actually needs a self driving crap in it\nAfter I ripped him and his car company again over his comments to the SEC I don't know what was it the beginning of football season what is it now for games and\nAnd so you probably you know as I was floating in the pool with my good buddies jak\nAnd Arturo last friday afternoon you're probably laughing at me because you heard over the weekend that he made a deal he made a deal with\nThe SEC and by by the time the markets opened on Monday the shares were not down but they were\nUp forty five dollars boy must you have thought how stupid I was\nOkay but I warned you never trust a Twitter famed yeah\nIt's the kind of person that has to tweet out his life his dog and cat picture of his grandkids what's going on in the White House today when he had for breakfast what what's going on a Tesla\nThere's there's something I don't know mentally unstable about that behavior because frankly I don't want to know Ninety nine percent of your life I I don't want to know any of the things going on in your life\nBut he Alon mosque can't help themselves and so this Friday morning before the markets even open\nHe's on another ramp ... but this time twittering against the SEC daring the judge who has to approve the SEC deal with him daring that judge\nTo argue that deal and drive him out of the ... have you guys want to invest with a nut job like Iran mosque\nI think you should do that shares are down two and a half percent as I wrote to show around four or five\nIn the morning [noise]\nOther major story of the money week was was the investing week was your retirement week was\nThe sell off in bonds sell off in bonds sell off in bonds\nOwing to the rising yields of bonds and many of you know what ... versus interest right\n\nGo ask for ... I really don't get ... yeah I I'm not really I I don't get the attraction the bonds Ryan ... bombs are weird right bombs are a little bonds are like me there are a little weird\nMaybe you\nBuy bonds when they yields pay you a big fat juicy income right now is what's happening now the\nIncome is getting bigger and fatter and\nJuice here so people are buying bonds\nBut when they pay you that big fat juicy yield at that income what's happening to that bond that you bought is the principal what you paid for it maybe a hundred dollars is declining maybe it's only worth Ninety five and next week maybe only Ninety maybe next week eighty five\nRight but to yield is going up so have you already own that bond as a yield is going up right your principal is losing value and hints this week we had what was called they bond sell off\nRight now means a soccer who bought the bonds yesterday that's all you\nGuys that are on a four O. one K. plan and the governor's got a bunch of those them come mutual funds and your four one K. because the government's sucking off of the ... of of of the contributions and you know the the you know the them call and all the other big firms pay out to the government in the form of I don't know your governors country you know campaign\nAnd the presidential campaign and the this campaign and that the ...\nSo you got a bunch of remember we talked about last week we talked about my brother raise account right how many bonds that I tell you a ...
