Trump ... a former conservatives I don't know if they were ever conservatives\nOn CNN Today use this as an opportunity to try to smear the President Bill Kristol spoke let's listen\nIf the if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate but you know we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this right here\nWe don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think they're an opportunity for him to to speak out a and to answer take accountability for\nYou know crystal ... these people than there are ... are just desperate\nOr to justify their positions says Trump has done everything that conservatives wanted him to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done so the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCall it simply do\nThis is ridiculous the you know ... one one comment\nA and I I've I forget it was in response to a question which elicited this where one could be done he said that would be have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue security guards and lots of sitting\nPerfectly wise\nRecommendation\nGot attacked by the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh forward magazine which is an extreme left wing\nJewish magazine blame him I said the Trump blamed the synagogue you didn't blame the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point a they're a nut case is out there who will kill\nA and it's a synagogue and other other schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats\nAnd the left or so people ranged over gun control issues that it practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and former rabbi a of the synagogue a live tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset that the media really dragging this into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nTo this evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic that the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify this airwaves but the airwaves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor a former rabbi excuse me on the Senate got that suffered so greatly let's listen\nTo welcome the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president's him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of states\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from ... I'm not saying\nWe have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is believing values not just ... I Believe in values and those are not the values that size of that and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh uh the current\nAnd the you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say it is in June the Jews are out to lunch with these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\nDonald Trump ... ah you know is of counter punch it basically and he doesn't speak for any group nothing like I mean I turned on MSNBC the other day\nA on it and the Cold War our set a panel everything that there were four people on the panel was the Trump it said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked to adults Hitler why because every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no ah Joseph mess see any of it was it Nineteen century figure who created the modern state in the middle of he's the one who claim nationalism is a Democrat they just won't find a pretext\nTo link Trump to Hitler\nA lawn so down on CNBC\nHe said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd that translates into Hitler that have against Trump dwarfs anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny and as a tax\n'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing a but these people they have done themselves into a whole here\nAnd they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln that the Democratic party or any major party has gone to war against the legitimate elected president a resistance\nWhich is what Schumer and Pelosi call their campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a system of compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election\nAnd that translates normally into a honeymoon the Gallup\nEstimate is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds that we're boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi who insist\nOn demonizing the president of United States which is something that hurts all Americans he as our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to quote Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a ... there are silver sober Democrats but they're intimidated by the party left now but they will come out of the closet\nJeffrey I have one and Alan Dershowitz yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Maier says the current rabbi or who of\nCourse is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people his worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like\nThis rabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath this do you have to come\nAround the president of the United states is always welcome\nSome citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome that's a good answer\nSo I'm a citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nThat's a good answer Neal you know every time I go to a synagogue by ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause the universities are teaching Jewish hatred\nThey they ... the curriculum\nAnd the middle eastern studies programs but generally is that you know the Jews stole land the land which is to just side ally\nThe land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks are not Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War\nIt just ... you know there's been a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are with the terrorists\nKnow it's pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nUh the aggressors an on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a and buy a both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are are helping support him and then continue to give him cover which I'm writing and stuff going\nThis is this is literally insane I I I have no words to this\nExactly this is the best president from the point of view of Jewish survival uh we've ever had\nA Trump you know in some ways his kids are the docks Jews for crying out here it's just in Saturday and are these so called liberal Jews\nAre contributing a problem we have for the Jews\nBy that well I mean they're always attacking me I've done a lot of demonstrations on college campuses against students for justice in Palestine and I'm not much to the Jewish left\nFor that reason that it's the same thing\nYou know the history here you have to do something but just having a security guard and the synagogue is\nSuch a common sense of course you need that um you know what I have ... or the mayor of Pittsburgh said no that's terrible and and the Jewish magazine blame for say the Trump is blaming the synagogue\nThis legislation double you'll be you'll reality we're two thousand Eighteen ...

government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee what he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in history\nAnd I'd been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum and uh he's aligned with groups like the dream\nSomeone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who openly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities and they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities in abolishing ice like Andrew does\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent [noise]\nSo I'm not I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for for Andrew because I think folks will uh who may not otherwise want a vote if they see Obama's for Andrew they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nWhen it comes to the misery ... regime and Venezuela so I welcome President Obama al I should be paying for his travel expenses to come down and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz and\nUm you know that put the race away for Ted and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWe'll get one is silver tongue order I mean that's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents but he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tries to ... he tried to do the cool thing that Obama does\nI I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last may with you for our listeners let's listen\nTo my grandmother used to say you know of all holler\nSanta spoken first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in this day he has spoken a racist conferences not calling this a dissent is a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course they are our\nLovely is over and MSNBC et cetera that oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today um there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boycott honors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum ... you know he ... sign this\nPledge called dream defenders hum I pledge my support to the freedom papers and the freedom papers are of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey respond [noise] so yeah like\nI mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida values\nAndrew was the one who was align themselves with the dream defenders they are openly antagonistic Israel they support boycott by the sanction of the state of Israel they actually organize boy or a flash mob protest in Israel they have special trips or just the target Israel on and so what\nWe're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of God but strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement\nFrom a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement is racist they say the police and prisons have no place injustice and that law enforcement should be defined that so that's what he said\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed on but I think that that's just way outside of what is acceptable in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course at the FBI agent is part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks for one and killings fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nWell that's right so he said this last Sunday when we did CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message is showing he acknowledge that this price the thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was\nActually paid for by an undercover FBI agent you start with a with a local real estate developer and and it comes out just a couple of days ago that that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under wrote an almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew\nDid not disclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida will also he\nGoes around saying that he's not been investigator and being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and has problems with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating don't that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nWith the laser ... down to some really simple in these last closing day it's such a sleazy dishes sleazy politics as usual bright people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need a lot of ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurant it's sleazy\nCorrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly\nHas has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth talking Obama wannabe Gillum for good leadership but it's not\nIt is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nI heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you gotta you gotta diagram\nThat sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that only I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better thirty eight percent said no impact thirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimate\nThirty six percent said it's made life worse than forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states\nUh thirty eight percent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan\nForty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the uh care about\nWell this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally brought across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance to the nearest refuge they they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday\nThat we need to welcome in the Caribbean and the United states um and so you could you have a more stark difference um for borders Andrew stroke and borders I Want to support our men and women and our if he wants to abolish ice\nWell again this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm sure we'll a pulse them down there a Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nAs absolutely critical for not just the state of Florida now but for twenty twenty and so all their big guns are coming down there so the president's coming for you you had pants down there or what else do you have in store for the final week\nSo it's going to be non stop I mean we're going to be doing we did

talking about earlier welcome to all of your joining us for the third our the phone number is eight seven seven seven six four to four to six eight for eight seven seven\nSeven six for twenty four twenty six\nI brought that up because so many of you are going to open enrollment in their company or this person that emailed me said their insurance benefits their health insurance benefits at their companies going up Thirteen percent not because the insurance went up Thirteen percent the insurance went up a certain amount and\nThe company is decreasing the amount of money they're going to participate in so\nThey would like to\nMove on and save that three or four hundred dollars and I told them they could do that\nBy going to Samaritan ministries have you guys haven't checked out health sharing\nMy wife and I were Samaritan ministries over three years now a or employees have Samaritan ministries it is a great great if you're a small business owner something to think about if you're an individual or something that it's so it's great you're going to get your you know light you're dealing with like minded people\nThat are going to pray for you if you have something that you're sharing a the system is amazing\nAh Samaritan ministries is sharing over twenty six million dollars a month\nTwenty six million dollars a another year this year they're not raising any of the costs or any of the share prices at all\nAnd uh sometimes some months that twice this year once maybe just wants to ... year last year was three\nUm where they reduced the share for the month\nBecause they didn't they didn't have that many needs so it is an amazing ministry and I hope during this open enrollment period it doesn't matter you can lead to you know that it's not just open or moment you can cancel if it's\nYou know it's march and you want out of your company insurance you can even get out\nYou just say I I don't want that anymore and moved to Samaritan ministries doesn't matter\nYou can get out anytime but\nJust saying make sure that you submit to Samaritan get everything approve don't drop it yet until you get it approved you'll know how much it's going to cost you when you apply as soon as you talk to him on the phone you all know that uh but then after that you uh\nWhat's also approved and all of that then you can drop your current insurance and you're gonna save a lot of money\nFor for seven or seven fifty five thirty three aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three let's look at the markets are the ... one point two percent uh the stacks up one point two percent\nThe recipes at one point five percent only ... percent so everything's still managing to hang in there and positive territory or getting a little bit of a rebound after some steep sell offs and let's hope we can hold that's the question is it going to hold the rest of the day we have a long way to go well see we get better could get worse who knows where oil prices\nAre finding a little bit of relief as apparently um\n[noise] the demand worries that we're impacting the cost of oil demand worries coming as a result of sanctions on supplies of oil coming out of Iran who are going to be an issue or have been somewhat\nRelieved\nAs a China stock markets really\nFed those concerns over potential slowed down an energy demand\nSo so China's demand maybe slowing down a some Brent Crude oil coming off a market through Iran and apparently\nUh it's it's expected the titans global supplies a little bit but all in all supplies have increased dramatically so that don't demand issue is not such an issue and we are seeing crude oil prices now\nSitting at sixty six can't see it sixty six point eighty eight sixty six point ADA so crude or down this is very very good news why because we would like to see crude oil prices\nEnough on top of a a big one of those big dumpsters\nUh we're doing you know not we as me but what is going on inside a space you'll see some pictures but if you go to financial issues slash studio\nFinancial issues dot org slash studio if you want to give to our project you'll see some pictures on that page to get an idea of our space there so we did a lot of damage a lot of demolition and we're we're getting ready to rebuild and we've already started some of the construction so\nWe were over there my wife and I do some things\nUm things that you know this is how bad I shouldn't I shouldn't even tell you because you think um stupid I Am but so far contractors charging too much to\nTrim out the officers for all that so I'm doing so we went over there I use a rough stolen cedar and that's what we're using and it's and so we went to see all that to my wife and I went over we see all that and then we decided we have some other kind of painting things were going to do and the clean up is a mess so we had this big huge jumper dumpster well\nIt was it's getting full so I got inside it to kind of move things around and get get it down a little bit more which I did\nI was trying to get out but I was standing on top of the dumpster I squat down ready to get out I lost my balance\nSo I stood back up to get my balance but an unfortunate it didn't work and I went down anyway so um that's what he's talking about so I appreciate that\nSo but I'll take it lifted if it's going to encourage anybody to become a partner to get to the ministry man I'm all about just plain common sense it wasn't just plain commonsense to do that my wife's was why in the world know what you said to me why in the world you up there and I should have\nDone it that's what she said so anyway she's probably right ... thank you for that wanders asking good morning Dan I'm ray a re and I\nMet you and Florence, Alabama last year I was a great town on me to remember our

it all in the Ross and then take it out withdraw some of it or whatever but I Would I Would do it that way if you're going to do it I Would rather see you\nHow old are you guys day in court for both forty nine yeah I Would rather see you\nRoll it over to a traditional i._r._a.\nAnd wherever you set that up to eighty a merit trade you set up a traditional i._r._a. set up a Roth IRA at the same time\nAnd I would when you roll it over to the traditional I Would move whatever you know may be you know a little bit of money maybe thirty thousand dollars or whatever you feel you can row over the bed and you're willing to pay the tax and between now and the time you're sixty five\n... of a plan that you're going to get it all rolled over into their off and just take your time doing it so that the tax burden is not going to hit you all one year\nOh Hey Don king and another question then is that she's gonna start working with a a and I haven't heard about ... to ... ... ...\nWorking with a a and I I haven't heard about that too but not familiar with it sounds like a or B and\nIt is just yes it is just like that um I don't know if the VA matches some they\nDo they do ... percent okay I got a traditionally would have been like twenty percent of our salary to parliament\nOkay so I Would I Would like that you would so in the CSP you've got to do at least the six percent here's what I think would be a really good strategy for you guys 'cause you're young\nI Would rather you get that CSP put six percent in the G is in George ... fund which you\nKnow and she is on um that's not going to earn you much it's consistent with the government bond fund it's biblical responsible [noise] then I Would max out your contributions fifty five hundred dollars into the raw fire right now\nAnd then that other discretionary income that you have that you would like to put into a four one K. or something assuming you're Maxine yours out as well yes then I Would put it in an investment accounts\nBecause you don't want you you're gonna ... as young as you guys are you are going to get to a place when you're ready to retire you're going to have all your money in qualified money of some sort\nAll your money is going to be money that is dictated uncontrolled by rules and regulations from the government and the IRS\nAnd you need to be able to you need to start establishments some ... qualified money it's okay to have a few accounts that have a significant amount of money and that's fine too I Would suggest to but if you're going to have more than that that's fine but\nI I Would want you to put that discretionary income in an advancement account once you max those out it makes a lot of sense now you have an account that is going to have a significant amount of money in it over the years\nBy the time you retire that you're going to have total flexibility with you can do whatever you want with that money you can buy a\nNew house you can buy a rental property you can uh do whatever you want you're going to have the flexibility and you're not going to be under that umbrella of government and reach rules and regulations so\nI I I wouldn't want to max out anything any more than you're already doing it ought to be in an investment again and you do that investment to Canada to name the the marriage rate as well so you understand you you're you're going to know the platform\nAnd how it all work and that would be the best thing I think you could do damage\nThat well thank you very much for your ... and let's make sure that I understand that so jeep and rock art or a board at the at the end of it\n... on my own ... correct yes and not just to join account that you're managing on your own at CD andme Eritrean yes\nWell thank you very much then You're

industry by becoming a partner with us in the ministry once you get for that partnership is access to our investment strategies access your asset allocation models my dock safe to come out every Monday or email alerts that may tell you when you're by yourself or maybe give you come from the bottom\nLine is an incredible value for eighty five dollars a year\nAnd you get to submit it sure would

ministry assured for\nUs to answer your your financial issues Samaritan ministries is a health care sharing ministry that takes us back to the book of acts as a ministry that we have\nThat if this is a mystery that has opened up their doors to me to make sure that it is a ministry that my wife and I wanted to dissipated yes that to me\nFor health care I Hope you will check them out thanked them for supporting foreign ministers Samaritan ministries dot\nOrg [noise] by this is an studio for financial reasons I Hope you will consider partnering with financial issues one of the things that you're going to get from that is access to our by list the access to ourselves ... you're going to become educated about the economy\nAnd the testimony from people just like you I Hope you consider the only the financial issues dot org\nEntering with his ministers that's financial issues dot board\nIt was working with which is\nNot necessarily were listening more shows\nAbout financial issues for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three [noise] your your your carpet you'd probably get a one or two more calls in a let me go to Eric Eric calling us from North Carolina Hey Eric\nHi thanks for taking my call sure I'm so I'm uh thirty four and um I have about\nTen grand around that me and my wife were mulling over there they're kind of starting to invest it and I like that they're doing the the biblical investing and I was looking at the same with a plan that I hear you talking about but uh that's um that's all the mutual funds I was kind of\nWondering if we were debating between doing that and maybe joining your ministry and and uh using your plans to kinda you know more like individual stock you know and so I wasn't sure if you had any recommendation on on just where to start\nI just yeah yeah so do you have anything set aside at work or anything for retirement\nOh yes yes I actually ... my uh four one K. contribution every year okay so so this is money that the smell just heading to the side and got you um I Know I make too much to qualify for the raw account right um but I really just wasn't sure whether it be the best place to start\nSo I think what you ought to do is get an open up and accounts um at any trade or TDY Amir trade or fidelity brokerage or you know one of the one of the a discount brokers 'em\nAnd follow along with it with a investment account a joy is just a joined account is an investment accounts [noise] uh that you that you can begin\nYup a joy is just to join account it's an investment account\nOr that you that you can begin to
