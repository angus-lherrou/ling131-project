got all jacked up because President Trump takes on Maxine Waters and President Trump is tough on Hillary and because they chant lock her up\nSo it has to be Donald Trump's falls America has to be on

seems again it's this is someone who is a fan of Donald Trump than it's got to be someone who's insane I'm just completely not\nAs many people who do this have an ... an element of of\nInsanity evil all all combined in my view but I'm not an expert on you know tracing bombed I I don't know I'm not a profile or of these situations that's why we're going to speak to profile ers who will tell us what this seems like people who know what bombs\nOr when they're designed to go off look like and what they must contain\nBut at the the the list of targets are all Democrats in all outspoken critics

she has this opportunity to to prove or brand and she blows it by voting against him and her whole brand went right out the window now and then\nOf course campus is like ... ... if she just doesn't fit with the north Dakota's code a mindset in the\nThe spirit of North Dakota which is one of I hearty courageous a mile still still has that frontier feeling oh they're not very popular um state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people do that and and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just put up with a cab nothing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty six to sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed that professor poured then she didn't believe\nHim but believe press report and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing you know with the phone turned off and noticed his demeanor\nYou know it just it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota is law that the independent spirit the rug in this\nFrontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been my own exposed during the Trump era\nThan media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide frenzy and fury and upset and\nAnd the last always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh um we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but people have a lot of theories there um and\nI and the leftist they're never satisfied with me get one thing and that's okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be health care for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you\nYou know assuming you and what it looks like you're going to um congressman in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride in last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy [noise]\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is\nLet's return to a respect for states ... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy you called states will show the way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nYou know states' rights and and that's what I Would have got to cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you can find a federal government is far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases\nAnd you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally are almost at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something\nDifferent than than the reality that it that is behind it all in in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on on our own individual behavior in what contribution that I mean we make to this\nThis discourse that's going on this lack of civility and without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nIt's a great way of putting it in we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'll be the next senator and the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the whole country I haven't been to Congress

better way in sending the prominent Democrats\nUh you know I'm just speculating but it just kind of makes sense I don't put it beyond them at all\nYou know I don't know I I don't I don't know what the [noise]\nI don't know what the truth is I Do know that we should wait until we have actual information\nAbout what this is\nA you're listening to your health a radio station a five five\nForty Laura a lot more to staying\nThe following is not a doctor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story begins with that and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're inducted and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three summer\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nCouldn't or the will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payments reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and called trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable\nAre critics of the president or all of them outspoken critics of the president of course you have President Obama and so forth but does that tell us anything the kind of obvious nature of this list\n[laughter] yeah I mean I guess it speaks to uh some some motives behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news at the other of a TV right now this is a great day but from view of everybody now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish here what they're trying to ideologies are trying to push for it but at the bottom line is there's a clear cut a disruption of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be track what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish the person did it\nOr not to give away all the investigative techniques but I mean right up right up front it'd be poking at a fingerprint\nAnalysis from a tape of the device or um you know the other other um modalities that you can use to to get his DNA evidence off of\nOff of the device if she if in fact it was west I mean you're never gonna have a completely sterile um uh item there are a specially since\nThis render safe by a bomb squad um there's lots of entry a value to which they should be able to ascertain that a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a a ... they've had inability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nSalvo ... the ... and you would think someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually deliver to trace it back to where it came from I mean\nThere has to be some kind of accountability or to a courier service through who\nWho you know where they picked it up or they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate become another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb\nLike this through the postal service because it's too easily detected is there anything to that\nWell I mean if you look for ... you know historical data they uh bombs have been put you through the mail um especially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what he did as a result the Unabomber stuff I mean you can't use the the post office or you can use other various means of\nThe courier service FedEx or whatever but I think when the day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days she but you're going to use something that's not detectable um look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we are where the the devices actually went off\nUm those were intended to all these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion so they were meant to instill fear in people that's the bottom line or a ... and again that is just my opinion\nUh Brian Morris uh Ryan we appreciate your insights here and we'll bring you the latest as a press conferences will be taking place throughout the day on the issue with these are no is it their terrorist uh they they're they're not attacks and that they they didn't\nAchieve their go if they didn't achieve the goal of violence however they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people\nAnd they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what went down a with a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign\nOr it's heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum are now is tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over round Santa congressmen for that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points\nAnd Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves I given the fact that he\nLied on TV about accepting gifts or from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believed was land developer and turned out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had walked right into the trap and I guess you could get away with lying about it I I don't\nTo me this whole thing is it's very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI has this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum and finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is playing the race card in order to avoid answering the the tough questions and being held accountable\nOr so we'll play some of that for you what ... what went down last night and a lot more eight five five forty Laura Laura Ingraham

than anything but we do love being here and um\nI went to one of our favorite places here when we come to mobile and we're going to our favorite place today some time before the town hall meeting so [noise]\nUm anyway good food good food good people little hot but aside from that it doesn't get any better so we we love mobile we're glad or here and we hope you'll come out to see us tonight we're going to be at the Mariette on airport boulevard\nTonight at six thirty come out early like the media as many of you as I possibly can I Try to do that we'll get started I Want to hear from you and I think a lot of questions I Want to hear about what you're thinking about the economy or you're thinking about the elections have that's going to impact your ability to be a good steward or not we want to hear about those things\nUm will give you a little bit of a recap of ah where where we think things are headed and we'll we'll go from there right now all the indices still are you know they really haven't I Wonder what the volume is I have not checked I should check it at the last ...\nBut I Wonder what the volume is right now I'm because\nThis is this is what we like to see you know if you start to feel good when you get you we've got some great economic numbers we've got a pending home sales are going up I'm almost ... percent uh that's pretty good because it's been four straight months of losing streaks\nA pending sales it's a very good number so we're really excited about that we got a very good do durable good numbers durable goods very important number ... and I'm I'm kind of surprised because new home sales were down some kind of surprised by this number\n... it was what I was hoping for but I'm surprised that we got a better half of one percent increase in durable goods\nDurable goods or were expected to be a negative number of one point five percent so that was missing the right direction and that's very good to hear so consumer still extremely confident uh and durable goods one of the things that I'm concerned about that could put a stop to all of this\nConfidence is if a gasoline prices continue to rise and and you know that's something that we have to be a can concerned about a particularly as we look at what was happening to oil prices but they have been coming down oil prices have been coming down\nAnd continue to come down and uh hopefully a gasoline prices are coming down so we're at a two eighty where it two dollars in eighty four cents nationally\nIt was to two dollars and eighty seven cents on Monday\nLast week it was two dollars in eighty seven cents last week so we're about uh where we were were lower than we were last week's slightly so [noise]\nI'm good news or we go back a month we are to eighty five would go back a year ago we are to forty five so when you love to see two dollars a forty five cents for gasoline again that would be wonderful I'd love to get back to a year ago because a year ago diesel fuel which two dollars and Seventy forty cents\nAnd right now it's three dollars and twenty nine cents so uh this is going to be great gasoline prices moving in the right direction along with a crude oil crude oil is staying [noise]\nYou know up where it needs to be for stock prices it's holding this uh Seventy six [noise] I'm Sorry sixty seven a dollar a barrel [noise]\nSo that's that's good I I you know if we continue on this trajectory we're going to be by the middle of next month a Thanksgiving very busy driving season we could see crude oil prices are sixty dollars are below with gasoline prices\nAre dropping significantly that would be a wonderful thing hopefully that'll happen that will be a huge relief and keep consumer confidence going a President Trump is concerned as tall as talked about the Federal Reserve and what the Federal Reserve should be doing [noise]\nYou know that they're not want to like [noise]\nOkay [noise] so at some point in time there is no hurry there's no sense of urgency but I but put them all in one just so you know where everything is\nAnd you're only getting one statement every month they don't make it easier for you\nSo if you as they move I think you said they moved to fidelity maybe yeah or something where [noise] okay\nSo that would be a great one to just put it all into that but here's the thing and after you do that it's going to be easy because they're already in your name so it's going to be real easy to do\nThe fidelity people without account ... people will will give you a transfer for them to sign it's not hard to do don't take care of it you won't have to do anything just have to sign the transfer for\nAll those other accounts that aren't in there and just let it all go in there when it comes in it goes into just a money market account just burning a little bit of interests\nDon't do anything for a year for I don't want you to invest it I don't want you to think about it you're going to have people that are going to call you know they say oh I Know they have [noise]\nAnd they're going to keep calling you you're not don't do anything don't do anything\nJust get the accounts during your name [noise] even if you don't move up and that's okay but don't do any investing just leave everything alone and then a year from now or so\nUh when when things settled down you've got so many changes to go through I'm so sorry to hear about your loss and there are so many there's so much emotion that we you know that we all have one we have\nA loss like that and I you you're not in a place not you but nobody is in a place to make any decisions or to talk to anybody as far as I'm concerned about anything\nFor the next year so I Want you to relax [noise] nothing can go wrong or happen with that money nothing just let it sit it transferred in sitting probably in a money market account most of it [noise]\nJust let it sit there don't worry about it when the statements come you don't even have to open them throw him in a file don't even don't even open it doesn't matter it's all irrelevant it doesn't matter what happens is\nUh just forget about it for twelve months and then a year from now call me back\nAnd ... we'll talk through some options and some things you might want to think about it [noise]\nBut don't don't talk to anybody\nA at all or do you you'll get a cold well it's really important to you do it now because the markets don't know nothing's nothing's important they have to do anything now so\nDon't even worry about it just relax and a move on there so many other things far more important that you can be praying through in working out in the next twelve months and this is in one of them so don't even worry about it so that's what I Want you to do and I think that all serve you really well later on\nOkay I'm Out that one more question has only been anything but a\nCat and then he said when we started work and when he was Eighteen and they must pay ... what do I want to me I Can't the part that at all or nothing or do I do\nKnow don't don't do anything with it don't even worry about it and I'm going to throw it in the same category don't even worry about it don't do anything [noise] don't don't take a look at it won't do anything I mean that it doesn't matter I I just\nI don't want to get even give you any ideas because I don't want you to be I I just you don't need to even be thinking about it\nSo it's not nothing's happening you I I'm gonna I'm gonna have some things that I'm going to want you to do a year from now or so but it's okay don't worry about it um you know in another year we ... we got to look at everything that you have\nLet's see if it works obviously if you need some of that to six something or by some huge you know use it for that but uh don't don't worry about where it is or what it's not doing or what it is doing just just leave that alone is well\nOkay I get them were were too young to I mean we were were ... we were both fifty three do\nYou know and I I don't need anything because he was the kind of\nDo you know and I I don't need anything because he was the kind of person that if you wanted something we bought and bought it All right so there's no credit card debt before that I just uh I I'm Sorry I didn't see all the while I'm\nYou know part of the earth but well\nYeah well you never have to be sorry for that and you certainly don't have to be ... sorry for being overwhelm you should be overwhelmed it's just a natural thing\nAnd you you would be I'm just trying to take one little element away it's not going to keep you from being totally a overwhelmed by so many other things but right now it's not something that should even be in your on your list of things to be thinking about\n... I definitely appreciate I listen to you every morning\nAnd I definitely appreciate all that you say\nAnd I think they don't know if you're right he pulled out the what what I mean\nA lot but he never even heard of you know I don't I Will be a part of my number because it ... it in a ... yeah so many um [noise] and that their company called ... and ... and you're right\nYou're right they call I

them off your back said call this guy here's a phone number I mean they're not that call but um yeah don't don't even worry about it you're you're in great shape\nOr your husband or was was very wise in very prudent in the way he did things I Wish more people\nAre operated like like he uh obviously did and now what a blessing that's going to be to you later later in in life but I'm just just ah

already and God Bless you You're welcome\nAnd folks we all need to be ... you know and I hope that you will I Hope that that all the listeners will think about ants un I lift a two or tomorrow morning this morning when you and your prayer time lifting enough to you that that God would hold her firmly in it in his grip\nAnd that um she would she would find the the strength and courage\nOr in the peace of mind to not be overwhelmed and it's such a difficult thing and we go to Roy Roy calling us from Texas hey Roy\nAnd then I have two questions regarding wrap our age and I'll be as brief as possible\nBy a okay automated farmer's son and Arkansas bed a little far more dodge jobs for eight years it didn't work out debated buying profitable for him now he's gone all\nAnd I'd like to take a postage from the sale of that farm and try to get her off our array for him but he's got no income\nUh other than our job\nAnd I don't know what the eligibility standard is a new not know the amount of money that I can contribute towards them or to or Jews or off for a year so if you can help me one of those questions are pretty\nSure so here's the thing Roy he can't put more if he's under fifty I assume he is he's under fifty he can't put more than five thousand five hundred dollars fifty five hundred dollars in a Roth by\nIn order to open a raw to contribute to a Roth you have to have earned income\nSo I'm his odd jobs and those kinds of things qualify for some earned income but you can't have earned income of four thousand dollars a year and contribute five thousand you can't contribute more than you have earned income\nSo he's got to have earned income but that's the legal limit\n[noise] that you can put in his five thousand dollars now I deal with if he does have some
