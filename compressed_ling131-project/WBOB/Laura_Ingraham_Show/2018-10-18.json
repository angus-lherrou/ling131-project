a roofing roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import of foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a\nTobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more and I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty or let's go to Evie in Florida Eddie\n[noise]\nHi Laura again I think on on the list is being an American states that choice for the border but as a you know an American citizen I I don't want to just think that that's a boating it's going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the voter has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are getting better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers and drugs\nGuns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population who are are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets is like no one else how many have you saw the frightening the frightening display last night on the anger mango it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you\nCan imagine is what's going to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee if the Democrats have their way by five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nGo I Believe that the easiest and quick solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal am surrounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nBeing able to get into the home studying act\nYou could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever and with the uh that already having a priority on any old studying at the opening up your could wind up with a lot of our own studying which would be helping all the Americans and at the same time\nPut one hell of a wall dollar\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go on\n\nThe moon is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need help cold trinity of one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something to talk to a certified comes when\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nCommunity will consolidate your accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late season over limit charges reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nBy now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his ... his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I look to see him as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain scheme gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and your um but uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again ... ... people who work hard for a living\nTry and take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo see now with that term and coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met last trip back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump have backbone and\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and the senators we didn't even think Adam anymore Lindsey Graham was the hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they started to come play like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it the day\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch bucket to work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumped the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nNow you're listening to your health the radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June thirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration\nTwenty nine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration and that those are the convenient facts inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nA and driven a school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... and ... year a year or so we've seen\nTruckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested at a seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them cash\nOn e just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York and buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town\nWere not anymore we're we're starting to come back to the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs me these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to\nLight them on this issue talking about how important are ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining as illegal immigration for president isn't against immigration\nEither go illegal immigration and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process but first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it and the problem\nIt's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it and the problem she sees as it sees around and people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... ...\nIt's ... it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly ... it's you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right up border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar\nAh Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier\nThan when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\n[laughter] it's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nWas screaming in the hearings but the people running down the uh the always the basement of the United states Capitol screaming at senators but the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed but people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house because a lot of people who were not measure well by the polls him twenty sixteen they\nCall a deplorable is right that people who haven't voted in recent election because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion and Donald Trump someone made for a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in the mid term election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and this time around they better do it because they think of the president's not I'm about ... is\n... now and that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he'd declares is in a sense from you know we believe in the opposite of antiseptic but near twenty seven is an hour plus eleven district that was a safe seat\nAnd they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kind of lean toward the Democratic socialist side of things really hates Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment\nAnd he's changed his tune because ... New York twenty seven is very pro Trump and now the columns there's been some federal trouble he's changed his tune and talked about how he wants to work with the president yesterday\nStar five five

five forty or a [noise]\n\nGod I mean we\n[noise] so it's much easier for me to do than it was when I was campaigning when I said this will happen this is a much easier situation [noise]\nEight five five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them as Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where\nMarty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist within the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists does a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest are Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every quarter of this district which is now a new district pencil in the seventh district uh it says everything from the urban core of Allentown from an eastern to the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier worked district called asleep built a region now what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is uh\nFor work district what we call this late felt a region\nOr what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they're happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue they don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house I'm a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what it's traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration what we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\n\nI think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just that the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nUh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive at\nA show immigration up here in Lee high value in the seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth so ... what would they tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nSo that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move to the center but a a result speak\nFor themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and\nBureaucracy you know from ... in the president to teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't state or any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker\nThe American people it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your a campaign or commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and\nAnd uh in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's job not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the\nPrimaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in ... uh we we announced a campaign um our our\nGrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters\nThe night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in ... district which in my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old\nBut what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is it is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America's standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stain or might Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that and a lot of credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical

County Virginia and she's behind them is a congressional race reelection\nIf she loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that immigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has so I'll give you that a stat and just a moment Dr Marc Christian is with us or he is a director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use of manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday counsel at the Saudi journalist who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's on Donald Trump's fault\nDr Christian good to have you with us out what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're now they're just affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me editor for the shit a fortune in the ... and you're right when you have a party that is owned by by then and uh uh you know all those all the guards it's it looks like they are often from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out there and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know the situation between the states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and the radicals and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nUm back in the south is because he loves loves the dictates of his all for personal gain because this is nonsense is doing this because the Saudi Government the government the government is doing a good work that helps that are not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president with a lot states\nAnd why I'm saying that because you and you look at what the current um gung Britain's and the Saudi Government is doing their head thinking many fronts their number one is\nThey are helping by defending the Islamic movement by putting a in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThe fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries there had been denied stage um\nWhen they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east\nThey're helping big time they get on the Iranian sanctions are and how the Trump is putting those on\nBy living oil prices in an all look up stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty\nThat never ever been imagine before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon what is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's in Egypt and Israel which is gonna be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years so Donald Trump is supporting um you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those seasons and on and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship on job or plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to follow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know\nI I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since the great in the United states but still ... over there and my ... in my home brew which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence\nWhen uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nAfter the Trump Administration embarrassed him publicly and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the pasture and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of\nThis incident going taking place excellent point\nWell I think again mark in America in ... in the American voters\nIf they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the ... which again it's it's ... it's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to see in a phobia they this is all they have it's it's\nWomen are oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ... I mean it's so\nPredictable that it's almost boring to talk about but meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about this thousands and thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men for young a military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally that is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening\nAnd it's outrageous and Americans have to stand against it total lawlessness\nA die hard and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas\nWhich is why they always go to this year's men and all kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing but when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for Democrats but go for Donald Trump and\nAn historic on way and then right after that they start talking about the curve and\nMarching to the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to divide and to try to uh make the Hispanic a voyage jumping into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized\nThe into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that that everything is it the night you pay attention to the days when you talk about it for three days how the Hispanic vote in Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know problem on the on the border and then we have to figure this out\nAnd Donald Trump says we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes or you know Americans can see through this\nBecause I trusted that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll give you that you have you're not going to be deceived by that eh Biddy filthy works on the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what mark ... exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated

transpire so many things going on a it looks like a turkey is a working to create a little bit more instability in the currency ah markets they're doing a good job of it and then that's exactly what is happening this is going to have a far bigger impact\nOf\nFor a bigger impact on on the euro zone that is a fear of something we've got to watch very closely all week long\nAnd you know I Know there's a lot of people that have email me and I remember one time about\nOh I'm going to go back six eight ... no longer in that 'cause it was last year I'm going I'm going to say it was probably a December November December last year\nAnd I was talking about what you're back to the reports were coming out of doors your bag and other things going on somebody emailed to say you know I I I Wish you'd stop talking about that it's got its so irrelevant I'm In ...\nThe folks I very seldom and I can say I do is not very seldom I probably more times that I Wish I Do talk sometimes about some things that might be fairly irrelevant but from an economic perspective I'm so at some point in time we've gotta we've gotta ... we've got to decide a couple of things\nAnd we've got to decide how is our economy going to get better is going to get better from the inside or is it going to get better from the outside of what I mean by that is are we going to do things internally here in the inside of our economy to make things better exactly like we're doing right now for our external forces\nLike a stronger euro zone\nA stronger Asia other economies around the globe gonna help contribute to us being\nA stronger economy and we need to take a look at the same time\nAt those things are going to help the rail our economy if it's a good one I Believe our economy is a good one right now I'm not talking about the markets and talking about the economy I Believe our economy is a good strong healthy economy right now\nSo one of the things that we've got to make a decision about is what could be well the economy what could the rail the efforts of this administration is it going to be eternal internally or is it going to be extraordinarily internally\nWould be things like the pure hatred for this president creates an environment where the president can't get anything done or the agenda can be achieved that would be one thing that could derail our economy\n\nCould you be tariffs that are so severe on our industry which I don't know of any coming down the road that could derail the economy certainly that could happen could it be the Federal Reserve getting carried away with interest rates the railing the economy\nCould the Federal Reserve getting a carried away with interest rates create a hyper inflation\nThese are all internal things that could change the course of the economy in a heartbeat\nAnd I have to say it's a very thin wire that this economy is walking along\nCould fall very easily\nExternal things are going to be things like financial crisis in other parts of the world that are going to impact us\nWhy so if there's a major financial crisis in Europe we would be extremely naive to go about our merry way and think that it's not going to impact the United states market why because finance makes the global economy go round and we're part of the global economy\nAnd if there is a financial crisis\nIn another major developed developed economic zone like the euro zone which is made up of twenty eight developed nations than we need to be concerned about that that in in of itself is a largest economy in the world\nNot any individual country in the eurozone but the euro zone in of itself I think it's a tornado they get\nBut that moment that I opened up the shoe box and looked at my items for the first time I realize that the song that I Would thing over and over that that somewhat so very true that Jesus didn't love me and he did notice me in the middle of this orphanage because of the shoe box\nWhat was that like what are some of the things in his shoe box that immediately grabbed your attention\nThe coloring books in crowds opening for the first time to seeing so many colors that stuffed animal that was the favorite and my most favorite while I Am in my shoe box was\nGetting my own at his fresh before because I knew I no longer had to share one brush with ten other girls well but that stuffed animal the reason I Love that the blast because missionaries a town\nAnd they would say I love you and give us hugs but when they weren't there to give us hugs we had that stuffed animal that we can carry around with us from snuggle with us night\nWell it's so important and then and and that's one of the things on the list yes that is so important to try to get into a box or if if you can I Know from Avon and our our uh our experience of being there we\nWe uh we think of those stuffed animals dolls that the kid got them when we saw them opening up shoe boxes and soccer ball cattle or your favorite [laughter] yeah they were there were huge so uh we we try we try to do that um so tell us about your journey to Christ\nUm to come into the saving grace of of Jesus was it as did that that comment came after the shoe box the first shoe boxes you got I suspect\nYes so I only got one shoe box and when I realized that Jesus loves me that ... that the shoe box they planted that seed of hoping my life and realizing OK\nThis Jesus that I've heard about maybe he is true and maybe there is something to that but I was young I was five and didn't fully understand more than that and then at the age of six that was adopted and now living in Maryland and my family taught me more if we're that Jesus was that I had had a glimpse of\nAnd developing that personal relationship and ultimately are asking price to be into my heart so it was a journey but it started because of that shoe box\nWell and now you speak around the country you know for for operation Christmas show and share your story\nAnd help motivate people to pack boxes in folks we we need everybody listening if you go to the website financial issues died or our website\nAnd you click on that operation Christmas Child a better it is so important\nUh that you do that I mean this means and now today when they get the shoe boxes Jackie [noise] um they also have an opportunity for the greatest journey right yes so so tell us about that\n[noise] so what I Love it that it's more than just the shoe box and more it's more than just showing loving hoping a tangible way but showing love and helping in eternal way with every shoe box that's given the child receives a booklet called the greatest gift and they're they learn about Jesus from creation to the cross\nAfter the first distribution the children by a to return to their local area for a twelve lesson disciple shut program\nAnd they're they learn what it means to faithfully be a follower of Jesus Christ and at the end of the twelve lessons that children graduate they perceive us or convicted and a New Testament Bible and their own language so from their their challenge to share what they've just learned\nWith their friends and with their families so because of the greatest journey we are creating disciples around the world and helping local pastor's because of operation Christmas Child nutrition or being able to start a communities are being transformed and the\nKingdom of God is growing\nYou know that's what I Love about Samaritan ministries is that Samaritans per se is that they they don't just give a shoe box and go away\nOr they ways up the way ahead of the shoe box is getting to a particular village or a particular town\nAnd they have raised that pastors local pastor's there that are going to teach this this ah greatest journey these twelve lessons and to start to grow disciples for Jesus Christ and that's the greatest bussing obviously yes all of all of this and and that's why we do it\nAh to share the love of Jesus first with the children as you felt\nAnd to share the gospel message of Jesus Christ ultimately and they hopefully will grow up\nTo be a fully devoted followers uses Christ you know what a what a blessing and a we've been we've had opportunities to be at some of the centers where they're giving out these eve on and I have\nAnd uh it is an incredible thing to see and how many shoe boxes um did they did they did last year do you do you know\nLast year the number I Believe was twelve million\nLast year the number I Believe was twelve million ... [noise] but since Nineteen Ninety three we've sent out over a hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes Taylor a hundred countries and to think that that number is still continuing to grow\nIt is amazing and a folks there is a church near you that is a distribution center\nOr that you can you can pack you can you can do a couple of things when you go to that linked financial issues died or click on that link\nAnd I'll take your rights to Samaritans purse slash OCC right and it'll take you to that you can pack a box on the line\nSo you can do that online if you want that box will be packed you'll pay for a ... a small amount to do that and you can pack a box on line or better yet\nHe bought an eye on now will do eight this year for our eight grand grandchildren\nAnd a pot that box the older grandchildren we will I'm a want them to participate in that and we can take that to our church our church has to happen to be a collection center and we can take that to the church and somewhere there's a church near you when you can get that information on the Web site\nAt um oh OSU Samaritans verse slash ... Americans first outta work slash OCC or go to financial issues\nDot org and click on the banner and you'll be able to do that and on that you'll find a whole list of things that would would uh we'd want you to pack and we're going to go through some of those things Jackie's pointed out a little stuffed animal that she received and how much that meant you how many years did you\nDid uh you you carry that around and have that that will that\nAnimal didn't lock me as long as I had hoped to because of the boys at the home never mean and they would feel our toys from us\nYes I'm not sure um it is it is amazing to see their their faces and this gift to remind them of the gift of Jesus the gift that we we get and I love to Jackie said that it ... it really kind of showed the love of\nCrises that you had been singing about\nYep uh for for us so ... some years you were left off of that orphanage when you were just a baby is that right yes yeah\nAnd you've got this at age five yeah and then a year later you were adopted yeah and you were here and grow up in a Maryland yeah right here so that's that's wonderful what a blessing um\nWhen we pack a shoe box there are a lot of things that I Know we'll talk about this year in the next segment but when we talk\nPack a shoe box there are certain things that we don't put in and that list is also on the website right say yeah that\nJust a reminder of things that you don't put in like guns in war time\nKind of ah things and candy you had all melt per go bad and things like that so you get that a complete list here isn't what are some of the uh things that you would tell our viewers when they pack their bags boxers some of the things that they need to be\nPraying about thinking about and and participate in it\nDefinitely to begin with prayer\nBecause prayer is the foundation of everything in life than to pray for the child that will be receiving your shoe box to pray that God will lead you to the right items because I Know a lot of times people say well if I pack wool hat no scars well I go to our country or if I thought flip flops to like go to the cold country\nAnd you know got already has that story written and you're just being a vessel to complete that story\nAnd sometimes those items will go to a hot country but God has a three written a child that needs to be reminded that even though I'm he's missing some fingers that those gloves that he's put on his hands he can see this ten fingers and that's what he needs to see or the child has been praying to give his mom a gift and\nWe're seeing is hot pink flip flops in his shoe box and so he was finally able to give his momma get those items in those stories are out there and the guy had some already written\nYeah isn't that that is so amazing and um we've heard stories over letters and things that have been sent and followed and um the circle of that they make you know to to come back to the person that Packer\nBox you know it's just incredible and when you hear their stories you know one thing for certain\nThat can always be a ... after we're going to pack a couple of boxes one for a a girl and one for a little voice the bonds gonna come out here and\nParticipate in that health and law trying to go through a show you some day and hopefully will motivate you right now during this place a website\nSo we like to say something that if it harms a child um we won't accept or if it harms the shoe box um that that's what our rules are the war toys\nBecause of this shoe box is going to war torn areas and we don't want to hurt the child that way liquids that can hurt the shoe box and then can days into space that will hold up shoe boxes that customs ... to stay away from those there's plenty of other things to include right\nAt customs ... to stay away from those there's plenty of other things to include right\nYeah even think about customs because that's a whole nother a story and I know that\nWe were packing one night at our church a tractor trailer of shoe boxes and one of the the the men at the church there were leading this in his prayer\nI don't know if it was before or after we were backing prayed the costumes for it said something about customs and make it would it would get through customs and quickly that's really important to think about as well yeah absolutely\nUm [noise] this is going to how many countries over a hundred countries you know wow it's amazing\nAnd bags backpacks those small little backpacks\nI Would suspect they're good they're all good things\nYeah mhm anything that's easily roll up into the shoe box\nIf if someone said to you [noise] [noise] for a girl and a boy if\nYou know what would be the well item that that um I I Know one is difficult to narrow it down to but what's the one thing that that would be great to put in there\n[noise] the one thing that would be great to put into a shoe box\nI think a toy of some sort because we didn't get many of them and so far child to have their own soy it's just amazing something that they can carry around whether it is that stuffed animal or that soccer ball but\nWhat's the hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes that had been sent out what I Can't pinpoint that every one of us had that same wow All right I never liked because of our situations I'm\nSpeaking from seeing all the children or the other one of these it really didn't matter right they were so thrilled every child was equally is thrilled with what they were receiving\nAs you know the next child even though there were so many different things and it was such a such an effect so oh go ahead\nA letter and a picture as the favorites some of the kids that receive shoe boxes when I got one they had pictures and letters and some some of the letters were able to translate it and the pictures that kids would run around all day and say look I Love my family\nAnd a growing up they often edge if you've ever wanted to protect anything you would hide it onto your mattress that night and so at night that picture would go under the mattress and then the next day at the same thing the letter would be shown around in the picture book I Am a lot of look at my family and other states\nWell that's that's great and it's\nSomething that we we don't we don't think about right and if somebody out there wants to call and for those notes leave a note or verse you
