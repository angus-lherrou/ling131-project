a ... it was an ugly ugly day\nIf you woke up and you heard the news on Thursday morning news was that morning while I was the news about rising bond\nYields yields\nAnd the news that China is implanting\nThe Chinese buying chips and all of the government's computers and phones the iPhones the defense department's computers the Navy's computers all of the computers that we buy from China have a chip in them\nAccording to the Bloomberg Businessweek article you would not have been surprised then on Thursday morning to see the market fall\nAll day I've been warning you off\nAll all day\nI've been warning you all that I thought inflation could get out of control could get ugly ugly more on that later in the show though I've been talking with you about the China trade war and about two or three weeks ago I warn you that the war had been\nDowngraded downgraded to a skirmish stylish and then it was likely to be downgraded even further to us back to is that\nBecause the president said he loves China he loves president gee there'll be there'll be a mess\nBut on Thursday we find out that China's putting computer chips by chips are in every electronic device will use at home and then the government that the government uses presumably to I don't know launch nuclear weapons\nI don't know to start a war\nI don't know every every every computer that the government's got got got secret Chinese chips in them\nChinese chips not so so let's get to that story\nAnd and the and the story of according to Sean Hannity is good men and women\nOf the FBI you know how Sean I says well I'm not talking about the bad men and women of the FBI like Jim\nCall me with the store King Day every day working guy at the FBI the good guys are really good guy they really do a good job\nAnd yet Hillary is still an indicted I understand the story [noise] I don't understand what makes them so good but maybe I'm wrong\nHere's a China spy chip story from Bloomberg Businessweek and this story this story could have huge ... stock market implications\nAnd twenty Fifteen Amazon Amazon began quietly evaluating a startup company called elemental technologies are potential acquisition to help with a major expansion\nOf their of their streaming service streaming video service that we know today as Amazon Prime video\nElemental technology had help stream the Olympic Games online and it helped communicate with the international space station and had ... and if funneled drone footage from the various wars to the CIA\n\nElemental national security contracts weren't the main reason for the proposed acquisition but they fit nicely with Amazon ... business\nSuch as a highly secure cloud that Amazon Web services is planning to sell to the to the CIA how many of you know that the CIA was going to host top secret information on the same crowd that you host pictures of your dog\nI knew that because I pay attention\nTo help with due diligence Amazon Web services which was overseeing the prospect of acquisition hired a third party company to scrutinize elemental security\nThe first pass uncovered troubling issues prompting Amazon Web services to take a closer look at elemental main product the expense of servers that customers installed in their networks to handle video compression\nThese servers were assembled for elemental by super micro computer not my own company supercomputer super micro computer uh San jose based company commonly known as super micro\nIt's also one of the world's biggest supplier of mother boards mother boards are the big board inside of your computer that upon which sits all the other junk\nRight\nIn late spring of twenty Fifteen elemental elemental staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario now this is good right so elemental is going to send samples servers to Ontario\nSo that some company in Ontario can determine if those servers that are going to the CIA are safe\nSo we are now and then or now we're now outsourcing national security to the milk sucking Canadians who won last sell a milk until this week it powdered milk to be accurate back\nSo I don't know why we're outsourcing our our our national security to some company\nAnd Canada hoarding milk\nNo stood on the servers mother boards the testers found a tiny microchip not much bigger than a grain of rice that wasn't supposed to be part of the boards original design now the first thing I think all you people at home should know\nAbout the CIA and the fear Federal Bureau of idiots and the so called good men and women who can't even find a cause to indict Hillary is that in the business of examining computer parts right like if you're intel\nOr your apply materials or kale like ten corps or your um lamb research\nWhen they inspect the computer chip they're they're inspecting the way for that the that the chip is ultimately etched on their their engraving it down to ... there there is backing down to the nano meter nanometers level\nI have multiple officers and most of the cities that I Do business and you pick the day you pick a time\nI'll send you an email with a map with directions to the office it's closest to you and that's all you have to do a little while later\nYou're going to receive an invitation to register for the amazing Gemini private client portal involved as well as some basic on boarding questions are kind of need to government kind of likes you the answer so that can make sure you're a real person\nThat kind of thing and then you just sit back and wait for the meeting to start\n[noise] so I'm Peter Navarro Peter Navarro\nWants to tell you that our being held hostage to Chinese steel is the most important thing in the world we have to have our own national sources Steele\n\nI Would tell you we need to have our own national source of semiconductor production of computer production of\nElectronics manufacturing\nSo now it's your choice choose me or choose Peter that moron Navarro\nBecause I Would argue to you we can always get steal from China we've got plenty of steel we can make in the United states\nBut well we don't have in this country is a reliable workforce that can manufacture high tech electronics and semi conductors we don't have a reliable source or we don't have a reliable logistics chain\nFor those items\nSo it's up to you to decide you can go after steel which is I don't know what thousands of years old or you can go after high tech electronics you tell me which one of those two jobs using pays the most\nSo let me see if I understand the story so far the cording to Sean Hannity that good and men and women over the FBI who still can't find a reason\nTo indict Hillary or Christian bubbles Ford or that Iran mosque for stock price manipulation they can't find a computer chip the size\nOf an enormous grain of rice\nBut the folks that apple\nCan I fear chai comes may have the keys to our nuclear systems are worse to our money the Chinese government didn't directly address questions about the manipulation supply chains safety they say in in cyberspace is an issue of common concern China's\nA victim meanwhile the FBI\nAnd CIA can't find a chip the size of a grain of rice on the mother board of the computer which is the equivalent of you finding a gigantic Goodyear Blimp\nIn your living room I may be wrong\nI digress Mardi please tell me there's a point to this ridiculous story please tell me that you have not made me listen to this incredibly long over my head boring story to make the point that China is buying on the please Marty telling me there's more to this radio program all there is more\nYeah there is\nThis could be a serious\nThere could be a serious retaliation justifiably\nThat could move markets so it will be interesting to see how the president manages to deal with China\nKnowing that they're spying on everything from your your Amazon Alexa all the way up to his aircraft carriers\n\nGot to be honest with you you know I got to be honest with you if this doesn't put price if if if listen\nIf exposing this story is saying that the Chinese hey we know what you did and we know how you did it if that doesn't bring them into the twenty first century where they can agree to cease and desist from this pattern of behavior\nIf this doesn't bring them to a trade negotiation that results in the end of this kind of behavior\n\nMaybe presidency is\nMaybe he's dumber than I think or maybe as dumb as I think he is smart\nPresident has every right to break China over this this is an existential risk to the United states this is an\nExistential risk to the United states and we don't have a supply chain or a manufacturing center in this country to replace the equipment that comes from China and we don't have a ... we don't have a reliable partner\nIn Asia that we should be relying on not one computer\nIn the defense department should be made by any company other than a one hundred percent American Company with one hundred percent sourcing in the United states and we're going to put US Steel and the damp pipes that we used to deliver ... oil or ... or liquid oil from Canada city and I said if that's got to be us pipe\nThe computers need to be us computers\n\nTwo weeks ago I diagnosed the problem of Ilan mosque of Twitter fame\nYou know him as the CEO of Tesla that overpriced electric car that probably will never succeed because nobody actually needs a self driving crap in it\nAfter I rep Tim and his car company again over his comments to the SEC I don't know what was it the beginning of football season what is it now for games and\nAnd so you probably you know as I was floating in the pool with my good buddies\nJak and Arturo last friday afternoon you're probably laughing at me because you heard over the weekend that he made a deal Iran made a deal with the SEC and by by the time the markets opened on Monday the share of or not down but they were forty five dollars ... boy must you have thought how stupid I was\nOkay but I warned you never trust a Twitter famed yeah it's the\nKind of person that has to tweet out of his life his dog has kept picture of his grandkids what's going on in the White House today what do you have for breakfast\nWhat what's going on a Tesla\nToday when he had for breakfast like what's going on a Tesla\n... there's there's something I don't know mentally unstable about that behavior because frankly I don't want to know Ninety nine percent of your life I I don't want to know any of the things going on in your life\nBut he Alon mosque can't help themselves and so this Friday morning before the markets even open\nHe's on another ramp ... but this time twittering against the SEC daring the judge who has to approve the SEC deal with him daring that judge\nOn new that deal and drive him out of the ... have you guys want to invest with a nut job like any line mosque\nI think you should do that shares are down to a half percent as I wrote to show around four or five\nIn the morning [noise]\nOther major story of the money week was was the investing week was your retirement week\nWas the sell off in bonds sell off him bonds sell off in bonds owing to the rising yields of bonds and many of you know what ... versus interest right\nGo ask ... I really don't get ... uh yeah I I'm not really I I don't get\nThe attraction the bonds Ryan ... bombs are weird right bombs are a little bonds are like me there are a little ... year\nMaybe you buy bonds when they yields pay you a big fat juicy income\nRight now is what's happening now the income is getting bigger and fatter and juice here so people are buying\nBonds but when they pay you that big fat juicy yield at that income what's happening to that bond that you bought is the principal what you paid for it maybe a hundred dollars is declining maybe it's only worth Ninety five and next week maybe only Ninety maybe next week eighty five\nRight but to yield is going up so have you already own that bond as a yield is going up right your principal is losing value and hence this week we had what was called they bond sell off right now me as a soccer who bought the bonds yesterday\nThat's all you guys that are on a four O. one K. plan and the governor's got a bunch of those them come mutual funds and your four one K. because the government's sucking off of the ... of of of the contributions and you know the the you know the them call and all the other big firms pay out to the government in the form of I don't know your governors country you know campaign\nAnd the presidential campaign and the this campaign and that the ...\nSo you got a bunch of remember we talked about last week we talked about my brother raise account right how many bonds that I tell you a ...

Jacksonville beach of St Augustine Orange Park middle bird green co ... villages Daytona asked them one at one point one in a um six hundred part one is Saturday and then parts want it to our air Sunday mornings together starting at nine AM\nConsider your pre game gift from me\nSo if the a reason\nThat the stock market's sold off on Thursday\nWas because of the incredible rise in bond yields\nAnd as stocks fall in price as yields rise in price how Marty you might ask the giant brain how is it possible to argue that this is a Goldilocks stock market\nGood question I think I have an answer I think Thursday sell off was Albert Resnick which does not mean that it's not going to sell off more just in the form of just because people want to take some profits a lock them up as\nI just suggest that but I think it was algorithm in which means that their computer potentially won the communist Chinese chips inside of it computers triggered an algorithm that said hey\nThere and these these algorithms sometimes a very very simple but I Know they're very very difficult and and the way above my pay grade\n\nThe computer basically says hey bond yields rise therefore stocks should the value of dividend stocks the value of equity should go down because people like to put their money in a safe place they value is safety more than they value growth they value the potential to lose money\nMore than the the potential to to make money that's what it's all about\n...\nBut the algorithms I think are not properly accounting for Donald Trump or the or the amazing Donald Trump economy\nOr the greatest economic green development in the U.S history you have to stop and remember how this recovery has work\nI'm going to be off script again I I Know I probably gonna be ten more pet you got twenty two minutes left or something I'm going to be off script again\nYou have to remember what this and it's important in order for you to make money the stock market you have to think about these things and know these things and inherent you yeah that that's why it's so important and I say to you I have CNBC on all day long is because I Am fully immersed in the stock market\nI see things and know things that you can't possibly see or know and I know the nuances of things that you can't possibly see or know because\nYou don't do this all day for a living but if you remember this recovery this recovery started as a consumer base recovery mom and dad got a little more money in their pocket\nThey were able to buy more closer you had a retail recovery they were able to go out to dinner so the dying the restaurant chains went up a little bit Wal Mart went up a little bit of Home Depot open up a little bit you're able to fix your house up a little bit you were may be able to buy a new house\nAnd so that's the consumer led part of the cycle\nBut er but if I'm not mistaken only two quarters ago only two quarters ago six months ago\nAnd I am correct only two quarters you go to Donald Trump corporate tax cuts went into effect so the corporations the businesses are just now beginning their business recovery remember\nApple and Google him and Ford and General Motors and\nWhoever else you ought to Boeing they they have only gotten the benefit of these tax cuts now for two\nQuarters and it took him the first quarter just to figure out what they could couldn't do ... how the tax cut ... what they might be able to do what other business was for sale that they could buy where where the where was there a piece of land that they could build a new factory\nOn these things don't turn on a dime we're only two quarters and so that Donald Trump corporate tax cuts\nNow have you say that we got all the Jews out of that in the first two quarters\nOkay I respectfully disagree with you maybe you know better maybe you got your advice from fidelity\nI don't know so I think that the algorithms are not consider\nI think that the algorithms\nAre not\nConsidering factoring in the benefits of those booming economy which is now business led not necessarily consumer led\nAnd I get that I mean how many more Ford F. one fifty can you people afford to buy how many more Katie Holmes can you people afford to buy and so maybe the consumer\nIs finally spit out the other news of Thursday was the headline news that Amazon\nWas raising their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour and oh my God that was going to be inflationary that was going to be the cause of inflation that would cause the Federal Reserve to raise rates higher\nThan expected somewhat like Anthony Weiner's I don't know somewhat prematurely you might say but here was the rub\nHere with the rub we've seen this story before and but but the algorithms haven't gotten the message yet we saw this story last year when Wal Mart raise their minimum wage\nAnd guess what the ... the market's been straight up ever since then despite the fact that the whole analysts community said hey raising the prices waving the wages for some cashiers at Wal Mart is going to be inflationary is going to be in the federal\nDidn't happen did not happen did it\n\nAnd this begs the question how many how many of Amazon workers are actually even pay less than minimum wage how many are actually getting a raise I don't know the answer maybe there was a lot maybe they're maybe most of them were already making minimum wage\nThe concern was well if I Am a zones raising minimum wages now those good guys at McDonald's or going to have to raise him now the guys over at whole foods is going to have to raise wages and now the guise of politics is gonna raise bugs\nIs going to be a catastrophe where people\nAre going to be out willy nilly were raising wages way better out we women around the stock market cry when we met her cause if we'd better cause the heels on the treasury says rocket hire\nWomen or panic the Federal Reserve might normalize interest rates\n\nTo me it was so much water off ducks back then was then there was the whole utilities things right I'm sure I'm fidelity told fidelity probably explains you then there was the whole utilities thing did any of you know there was this much financial\nNews this week while you were out taking the kids to the zoo Moore yoga or or or soccer or whatever whatever sport it is this week\nWho knew guy on the radio could make money news this much fun\nSo Thursday's drop wasn't just big it was weird right it was weird the Dow Jones industrial dropped two hundred and points the S. and P. five hundred and drop twenty four NASDAQ dropped a tumbled one point eight percent\nSo what's strange is that there were only two sectors trading up on the day and there are sectors that don't usually trade up together like Democrats or Republicans I no matter what one says the other does the other right\nTo raise your hands of you know the answer what two sectors were up\nOn Thursday right exactly correct the financial sector and the utility sector we're both up\nLike cats and dogs living together says Barron's utilities and financials moving off usually move in opposite directions but not Thursday financial benefit when rates are rising city group um J. P. Morgan\nBut they really haven't they really haven't risen Barry they've been\nLagging sector for most of the year and utilities generally game when ... are falling and that's the opposite of what happened this week\nBecause utilities generally compete with other forms of fixed income\nSo what the tenure treasury seeing as big as one day most since the elections has twenty sixteen the moving financials as easily explained and understood the but the but the move up and utilities a bond alternative\nOften bombed for their chunky derivatives why were they up this week\nSo in treasuries rise it ... it's supposed to make them less attractive right now more attractive but that's not what happened\nThursday it's not what happened\nMaybe you just move out of some of your momentum stocks\nBig tech stocks and maybe you go buy some lower value stocks I don't\nKnow there's a new CEO at General Electric I Can't tell you what to do with that stock talk to your own advisor but there is a new CEO at a stock at a company\nTalk to your on advisor but there is a new CEO at a stock at a company has been decimated\n\nDecimated\nTrying to see this as a buying opportunity an emphasis for asset allocation in rebalancing that'll favor longer years so instead of buying so a lot of you guys said well look I might put a little bit of money down here and these two years the three years he's the short term treasuries\nBecause the rates are so low and by golly what I'm putting them in these because I Want to be able to get out I Want to be able to get out when when the rates go higher I Want to be able to get out without any kind of a a ... a decline in my share price\nWill now that time he saying now is saying hey Marty was out there he was looking at his\nBond is listed bonds that are available there's bonds are six and a half seven seven and a half percent\nI have to tell you if you own in a new idea and you can buy if you're going to come into my company and look for bonds that

lifestyles unlimited welcome Joanne I'm so glad you could joined me today\nOh my goodness thank you so much for having me on I'm so excited to be here\nI Am too because today we want to talk about harnessing your fear to drive your success\nAnd I think that this is an important topic because we all experience it you know fear is a a common human emotion\nAnd it can drive a variety of activities a variety of responses and how we allow\nFear to drive those responses it's going to determine the outcomes in our lives and stuff that you and I have talked about before something that we've experienced in our own lives and in our daily lives are comprised of a series of habits\nBased on our core beliefs about how the world works\nAnd we do thousands of things each day without conscious thought\nYeah the first thing that came to mind when when we were talking about this was that experience of deciding you're going to stop off someplace on the way home you get stopped by the pharmacy you're going to stop and pick up some milk and bread and you're getting your car\nAnd you start driving\nAnd the next thing you know you're pulling into your driveway\nAnd I've had that experience of not even being able to really recollect the drive home which can be a little bit scary when you realize okay I'm supposed to be at the grocery store and I'm sitting in front of my garage and I don't even remember how I got here well the reason that happens is because that that is such an ingrained habit\nThat we are driving subconsciously our mind as busy processing other things and and we're just following that muscle memory home so then we got to pull back out of the garage back to the grocery store and we've all had that experience and that's how much of our life a curse\nAnd breaking out of those habits the longer they've been in place the harder they are and the habits are formed by core beliefs we have about life that we learn from the time we're born\nFrom everything we experience or friends or family all of the input we get to our lives tell us how the world works and we experience either things that confirmed that that is correct or things that tell us well no that is incorrect\nAnd so change is often forced upon us we we get into these habits right Chilean and we and we live our lives and then something happens and\nStar star five five six at star star five

version of what I'm saying\nThis is Len Morrow infidel today with Jillian Garland on the ... radio show and today we're talking about how to harness your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will allow you to create the wealth and passive income that you need to live the lifestyle that you desire and of course we believe\nThat real estate is the best vehicle to do that and\nSo we talk a lot about that and it's not that we love real estate it's that real estate is the investment\nThat gives us the types of tax breaks I'm the type of a runway that we need dealt talks about it as a train you know that that the stock market goes up and down\nIn a moment based on the news based on emotion real estate is like a train and the distance you can see it coming you can take a vase of action and get off the tracks before it runs you over\nAnd uh I I just just love when he talks about that he's done several several shows using that analogy and it says it's so true we can see things happening and they don't they don't happen in a moment's notice they don't happen in a day\nAnd even when the economy changes we don't have all our tenants moved out you know one of the great things about real estate as we all like to have a roof over our head\nAnd that that allows us to to maintain occupancy in our apartment center a single family rentals or through all\nMarket cycles it but when we talk about fear Jillian you know as a mentor you you hold people's hand figuratively through through this transformational process and for me it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life\nIs to stand by someone side as they fundamentally change their life\nAnd are able to achieve goals that they thought were out of reach for them\nSo we talked about\nHow we develop those\nParadigms in life the things that we believe in in your experience what are the things that people here are growing up that create a belief system that makes it hard for them to get away from\nWorking for a company you know the idea that somebody expects they're going to work for the same company you know their whole life for most of their life\nIs should be gone but yet it seems to be a strong paradigm that that getting that good education is going to get you that job and you're going to be able to move up and invest in a four one K.\nThen move it to a self directed IRA and invest in the stock market and retire and I think that's that's still the paradigm I still see articles telling millennials this is what they should do\nAnd where does that come from when people tell you stories\nWhere is this highly ingrained paradigm coming from in our society\n[noise]\nPersonally I think that the paradigm comes from your upbringing and how you were raised I'm I was a very very fortunate individual in the sense that I grew up in a very loving household and I also had the experience of being raised with my grandparents as well so I had to generation telling me what I should do in order to\nCheck off all the boxes that I'm supposed to as an adult you know the education was very important in our household though went to college and then there was always the conversation about\nHow it's so great when somebody has a job for their entire life or they just hit their tenure at at this company or whatever the case may be and then for the call but Schmidt pride you get accolades for that\nThough obviously growing up in a household like that you want to adult do you want to be just like that you're emulating the people that you were raised by\nThe becomes a situation where I wanted all of those things\nNow don't get me wrong my parents do not invest in real estate um they they support me and my decision to invest in real estate and I think that they are very intrigued um they still also have the fear which is kind of comical because they have seen it first hand how wonderful it is and how much has changed my life\nUm but it also becomes a situation to where you know they\nAre fearful because they still hear things and they can sample in two thousand nine when the real estate market crash they're fearful and the sons but what if the real estate market cautious again and you're invested in real estate what's gonna happen and I just kind of smile because it becomes this\nYou're invested in real estate what's gonna happen\nAnd I just kind of smile because it becomes a situation where you know I'm not investing in the stock market where everything is just gone with a couple of little chicks than a couple of flashing lights all my money disappeared from one computer to another it's a situation where I own real estate and I have rental properties and\nNobody is going to do a mass exodus out of my homes because they need a place to live and I've done it right I fall adult map and clean and functional and providing people with safe affordable living\nThough they're going to continue to stay in my tenants stood therefore I Will continue to be able to make money no matter what the market throws out me um\nI also think that a lot of times people are so scared because they always had the horror stories of you know their uncles neighbors friends brother had a rental property one's Twenty years ago and it was a nightmare and all of these things went wrong and yadda yadda yadda we all have heard that story every single one of us can account for that\nAnd it's just not true that guy that you heard that story about the hand information just didn't do it correctly he might have on it really a rental property but he didn't own it correctly or he didn't buy it correctly or whatever the case may be\nThough I think that the biggest push for change lifestyles are the reason why so many people are able to leave their comfort zones of what it is that they're supposed to be doing up poor societal norms or at or their upbringing is there's it's a whole group of like minded people that want a better life\nAs Adele likes to say the only thing standing in the way as a great life is a good life\nSo it's really remarkable to have a huge group of support system family a group of lifestyle just because\nEverybody has the same goals and not to be successful and for other people to be successful as well you know I'm the abundance mentality on ... does not apply to become thought type of thinking that is able to propel you to the next level\nIt was actually kind of funny because I was having a conversation with my mother the other day and she was talking about her um four one K. and she just you know would put money into her four oh one K. and she never looked at it as do many Americans do because they can't touch it and tell their retirement age\nSo she hasn't looked at it in years and years and years and she was looking at it and she was so happy that it had gone up and\n... and it did it went up so like I said it it it worked well for her but it also became a situation where I started having the conversation with her if she would have invested whatever she put into her four one K. into real estate\nThat number would be tenfold higher but I think that so many Americans are trapped in the thought process that oh yeah it went up\nAnd once again she never talked to she never paid attention to it so it's a situation where if it went up ... or if it dropped or if it went up a little bit she's just happy that it didn't go down and how bad is that you know you work your entire life\nAnd stayed in state and safe and you're just hoping that it's going to be a little bit more than you put in\nAnd that's not a way to live a life and that is definitely not a way to plan for your future\nSo it was comical and like I said my parents are very responsible and successful individuals in their own right but it was just kind of comical\nAnd and you hit on a really important topic and when we come back to and I want to talk a little bit more about that because\nIt it is the uh it's interesting\nParadigm that we have surrounding for one case in taxes both of those things are taken out of our paychecks so we kind of ignore that that money is really hours\nAnd then we don't understand the dynamics of how they work and that's part of what drives the fear and if we can harness that\nWe can drive success instead this is Len borough And Julian Garland on the Dell wants the radio show if you have a question get on the line eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eighty seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven and if you want to find out more about our activities of the ... to the\nTo that four one K. and and you ... you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that had a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement [noise]\nIf you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven Julian can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something do you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated can you talk a little bit about that\nYeah [noise] so for me going into lifestyles and learning the entire um those are real estate investing kind of became a no brainer after the thoughts I Know that sounds silly but I I'm super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass half empty kind of I can take you to\nI I'm super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass half empty kinda got I can take you done any rabbit hole of gloom and doom\nAnd I'm also very risk adverse so I understand I fundamentally understand where people that are coming from that do you invest in for one k.'s and think that\nReal estate is a scary thing because you know they watch those and Spain HGTV channels where it's like we're going to flip this house and that's how you make money we're going to take this house down to the studs and you're going to get off of work and you're going to come here and here to stay here till three in the morning\nBusting out drywall you know that's what people think of when they think of real estate investing and it couldn't be further from the truth [laughter]\nSo I decided to take it upon myself to go down my rabbit hole of gloom and doom and try to find the loop hole and lifestyles unlimited path I wanted to see where there there was something wrong or\nHow the gotcha I'm always looking for the gotcha so it became very appearance me pretty early on that there really wasn't a gotcha because I'm In control I'm the one that makes these decisions and in regards to me being risk averse this was a perfect fit because as we talked about earlier\n\n... hey you literally put money into that account your own money\nAnd if you're lucky you have an employer that matches it and then it just you pretend it's not there that is the best course of action because what's gonna happen as it goes up it goes down it goes up it goes down hopefully it continues to go up but more than likely it's going to go down\nThat's actually the gamble real estate investing isn't a gamble real estate investing the tried and true process and\nIt can be proved if you just educate yourself you know a lot of times people come in and they want to talk to me about their fears and their concerns and they're always looking for the gotcha and the answer is just be informed just be prepared for those situations and that's what lifestyles limited does\nIt prepare people for situation\nUm a lot of times people are scared about things like well how do I deal with this situation if a tenant need me to the toilets clogged and they can't do anything about it and something happened\nCollege Palmer I I'm not going to tell you to go get a masters in plumbing just\nCall a plumber that's the logical step um but at the situation to where you're correctly educated unprepared for real estate investing you change that toilet out when you bought the house so the likelihood the statistical possibility of that toilet going south on yeah it's\nPretty slim so you know we ... if you do everything right from the beginning\nThat's how you are able to be successful and real estate investing and you know every single month that that when you're trying to pay their rent you're going to pay that mortgage and you have money in your pocket because that's the path of stream of income that's coming through\nSo in regards to the tax benefits to it it's a life saver you know you're able to take advantage of tax benefits are laid off that you wouldn't otherwise be able to if you weren't a real estate investor and then when you're looking at that\nLying on your tax returns saying how much did you pay in taxes you're just going to start with only that number down because of your uh deductions and real estate so\nIt it it to me it's I at the risk adverse individual I feel that this this significantly less with\nMore ... I ... I ... I feel that this is a significantly lower risk for an investment than just giving your money to an employer but give your money to a four one K. management company and these people just go in and invest and whatever and it goes up and it goes down so\nI I think that this is actually the more conservative way of investing in your future opposed to the conventional paradigms which is kind of ironic but it's true that is actually the safer way\nYeah and and it is because you know again there's those those um miss out there about real estate investing and and that have to be overcome you thinking about the fears that people have\nOne fear that people have about change is that when I go to change I'm being asked to suspend\nA logic and being asked to suspend the the knowledge that I think that I have and and the point that I think you just made is that we're not asking anyone to suspend a logic to ... to to ignore the knowledge that they have acquired over life we're asking them actually to go back to some fundamental core beliefs about\nPeople and how the world works and when we come back from this break we'll talk more about that and and we'll get some more encourage meant in tips on harnessing your beer to drive six and\nThis is ...
