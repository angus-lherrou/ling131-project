debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need to help coal trinity one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nCould he will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would\nTell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt and\nAn example of civility and so for a senator who say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants\nThat surely that is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong a I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech\nFreedom to demonstrate butter ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if Congress woman doesn't intend violence\nThere's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic representative government function properly uh I got to be a few feet away we got to have a\nA discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean that this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes and take him out\nThat she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she was like take him out and\nTelling people that get harassed and restaurants and\nIt seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that\nBut when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator it's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins yet people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office in public places\nAnd we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights\nThe only thing you can count on his police protection and we have but then you can't have police protection for five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon a local police or you can't\nDo that as well so are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but our\nDemocracy will be a stronger with respect full political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you hold on called get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or\nKamala Harris have to to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is\nCornering women in elevators this this is something and we have we have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough times\nSome whack a noodle is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands Scott help us so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise it but they gotta they gotta responsibilities or ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that guy there go ahead you wait a long time\nI think Senator Grassley a lessons learned from this cabin on saga of many of us thought\nThat in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations it any thought to solidifying the rules so you can't extend\nHearings past the closer the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nWell I've read your tweets when you took me to tears called me for for not calling for a whole but but you can't you can't you ... if I call the vote today you wanted to be when the laws we\nWe tend to tend to rely on and so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it and so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the ... because I don't know but I corrected myself and I you and\nYou and McConnell both hindered handled this\nMaster play in the face of incredibly difficult\nAnd I think I read I highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said what\nIf you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you\nCouldn't have been more solicited of Dr Ford I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\n[noise] well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to Anita Hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota undecided divide vote against cabin off a lot of people talked about whether the\nRemains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator had cancer\nHappened as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camp so\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that it may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds its you compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the asphalt would have compromised um my true belief that um this person's um did not have\nThe temperament to be on the Supreme Court they're still repeating\nThat the temperament issues Senator Grassley\n[noise] listen this gets back to what he told you got successful years on the DC circuit the second most important in\nA court in the land has been college or even people like Garland\nA said that he had that sort of a approach June ... and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is tempered you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh actually the case and just to use those two things to go by\nSo consequently it what she said senator Kim said plus your question brings me two or three of them is\nA is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part\nTowards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech one\nEach day hike or something like ...\nYeah so so ah you know after twenty eight years or less the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great stage and knowledge\nAnd academic background and more importantly is work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the ah the Susan Collins um situation in main course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the uh her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how is that looking\n[noise] well we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they gotta look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that and I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million elector\nBut they raised ... million against her so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody the grill auto respect her and want Kavanaugh on the porch onto a along that line and I hope a rallying cry for Republicans over the next twenty eight days between now and the election\nAm

eight hundred three eight five\nCongressman what is going on now we had you had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein or the other day down to where the heck when they find a Florida yeah and I saw rot at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah I think often pick the dust on the president what did you know he's probably your best friend's wedding what's a theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I still do the facts are facts and that you have to give it McCain memos that we subpoenaed\nThere are all these stories out a earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the present in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were a phone recording wherever they want to do\nUm and the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't do that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was opposed to a tomorrow\nOr in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI made me think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said that you are or at the stores that said he said there's been a tape and this page and then went and talked to Mr Baker so a book for\nA while hopefully hopefully he'll take change his mind that will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman joined explain James Baker the uh the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page and the Cape call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that\nUh he was he talk to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein I never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct ... deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to page FBI council demoted than left and of course Peter Struck\nCounterintelligence demoted than fire top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until Mr Rosenstein\nNamed Mr Mahler to take it investigates over why this is important that furniture Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show as always cut him think he I asked my producer will make it either no no he's he's not he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that he they claimed it was a joke and maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself or get wired go and take the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment go I I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely Laura you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of the ordinance mean that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be shed\nA particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen late night that the date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire Comey may seventeenth is when Rosenstein names\nAre lower as the special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe on that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel and obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n... again the the main question that is on the table I think as a mother is going to do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of\nDonald Trump ... now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and said hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and\nCarter Page where does he go to get you know his reputation back and and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twist it for years\nNow and I that's that's good you brought that up because we sometimes it's important is to go back to the basics the Clinton campaign the DNC paid curtains carry law firm who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally cooperated in that document became the basis for going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other party campaign that is what happened here\nAnd it and and they used the press to get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is a ... works for them she get information to her husband's events little bit to the FBI so she gets permission to resort to Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility always say the more people talking about the live easier the lies to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie and they use that to go to spot on the other camp it's\nWhat you wanted to ... um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democratic gains that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out yeah I Hope\nSo I Hope so and I was I was in or out about across our district and live in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that our Senate helpful\nAnd are unconfirmed at good manager was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see it at the leftist going completely crazy we did a tweet the other day I had more people commented that we said today's left a plot capital Nick destroy Kavanaugh\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced of radical you know ... when he disrespected the flag embrace Cuomo when he says America was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people who support the president\nOr an old by the way will destroy cabin on the positive I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is to stand over the next twenty six days and that we can keep the majority in the house\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there [noise] yeah I mean\nI think you have to uh I I don't know if I started as a fuel but my ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters deter first rants and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were\nOut and she started wearing a line of people getting moving into the theater and um she just started ... you know yelling shame and evil and Jim Jordan\nUm she just started ... you know yelling shaming eagle and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that the people who are on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit or\nYou know look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but just by about ... about the idea let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do it but they found to do it and it's ... it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing that I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up or removing him as deputy AJ let's listen\nI think the president realizes that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it wouldn't give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why wouldn't you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down and have transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I I it seems like things are pretty quiet something they must be riding the report card that\nYeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a that that can be right and I obviously respect the ... and all the things he's written about always done so I look I don't think of any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after Bob or is that I think that that's obvious but it's\n\nWrong and I think that that will happen at some point too but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election of until after the special counsel's work is finished\nA Jim Jordan

lose a tower or something [noise] but um\nNonetheless I Know that we have so many devoted listeners and followers and partners in those areas the first place we were on the air\nIn Florida some years ago was in the panhandle and so that area is a been a good area for us and and we are we're we're a love our to our listeners like all of our listeners and we just hope you stay safe\nUm where we don't um we don't care about your material things we hope you took your your photo albums that's about it but that can all be replaced we just want everybody to get out of harm's way and stay safe [noise]\nUh and I did hear that is now a category for right now the day I was having the worst day attack since June twenty fifth June twenty fifth\nUm when you think about it not that old and it's not that big of a deal but nonetheless um June twenty fifth the Dow is down a considerably here this morning or\nAs you know there's been some pretty good economic news doesn't matter everybody's watching a couple of other things said trade a political upheaval and volatility on the political front so and so forth all those kinds of things way into negativity it's all kind of ridiculous to me but I Want you to think about something\nThe store with twenty six thousand that's number one don't know if it'll last but it is right now the day I was down three hundred and forty one points\nI remember a day when the Dow is down three hundred and forty points that we would be oh my word it's only one point two percent\nIt's not a huge amount to anything over one percent of significant so we need to be concerned a little bit but we're a long way off from this year's highs but nonetheless a or a long way away from going to this week ears lows we could we could do it today we could do it tomorrow\nBut anyway we'll try to get a handle on all of this is happening I don't see the rationale behind this\nSo we'll see gold is slipping obviously wise goes slipping wait a minute if anything else is crashing shouldn't go be going up yeah probably because that signals or a scary a ... a worst economy goes or not going anywhere but damn\nProducer price index jumped maybe that's got something to do with it here's why\nProducer price index goes up four tenths of one percent they're expecting it to go up to ten to one percent producer price index now we're making an assumption that these producers are going to pass that along to consumers will find that out tomorrow\nBut CPI\nRPI producer price index up four tenths of one percent\nNow\nThat's taking the PIN number for the last twelve months from two point six percent did two point eight percent what is this for see that it's perceived as inflation\n\nWhat happens if there's inflation what is the Federal Reserve do when you guys are smart now you're listening to this program for three hours every day for years and years some of you\nWhat is what does that mean\nThat's true some of you probably said inflation\nIt all so what's inflation me inflation means that the Federal Reserve is going to get concerned that the economy is heating up and they're going to raise rates again the Federal Reserve already said yesterday they want to raise rates they were going to continue to raise rates I don't think it's going to change much\nThank you Dan\nThank you George I appreciate it that's great stuff another George different

the moral majority\n[noise]\nHe told me about the movement the moral ... majority [noise]\nUm that is a good that is a good question I have an answer\nI don't feel comfortable answering the questions [laughter] just I'm just being honest with you George but I ... a ... because a number one it's um\nSomething I don't understand I kinda do and I don't um [noise]\nAnd it's something that is extremely frustrating to me so I stay away from it and I'll probably end up saying something that I'd be sorry I said so I won't talk about it but I Will say this the majority the moral majority\nIs alive and well and that as you and I George there was alive and well at the presidential elections there was a moral majority not the movement but the people the evangelical Christians that changed\nThe world you change the world you know that when you voted in the last you change the world if you voted for President Trump you change the world you change the face of the Supreme Court for an entire generation praise God for my grandchildren thank you\nFor changing the world uh the Supreme Court for that but we changed the world this president's kept his promises and it's going to continue to do so\nBut listen we need him to have a Congress\nThat is going to live in a poll and continue to further his agenda it is critically important that we have a Congress that it's going to stand by this president\nSo you know where I'm going right it has never been more critically important to vote than this November election it's just true\nSo you in the next twenty eight days you would better come out and vote or twenty seven or whatever it is you better come out and vote because we got to keep this going this moral majority we got to keep it going\nAnd you are responsible for doing that you if you've never voted in a midterm election before let this be the first just make sure you do it\nSo all of the ... all of you that voted in the last presidential election you add better vote now because the last just fired up to the to the likes of which we've never seen and we see what they're fired up about the far far left\nI said last night to somebody socialism socialism\nI said you're worried about socialism we better be worried about communism we're going to worry about fascism we better be worried about Marxism we\nMay be getting to the point opinion on our elections go we may be getting to the point where we will wish\nWe had socialism socialism\nGo like the greatest thing in the world compared to the road that we are going down\nSocialism this isn't a vote against socialism this is a vote against something far worse we can't let it happen and we have the power we have the power not to let that happen [noise] All right let me go to go to Robert Robert is calling us from Louisiana hey Robert\nAre you now I'm going to tell you my father was really worried about the economy collapsed that eat eat eat dog ten years ago but both me and my sister thirty six point seven out of that goal uh-huh each okay uh what why would you go to sell that if that was your goal\n[noise] if that was my and I would go to a website called it's a\nA pie and he acts A. P. M. E. X. dot com\n[noise] and um [noise] I I only say that for this reason\nUh for years and years I have bought and sold a little bit of goals little bit of silver from them\nThey're very reputable but but here's what I like about um they're not predators you don't ever have to talk to anybody if you don't want to and I love that notion [noise]\nUm and they will it's on their website what they're going to buy your goal for it's published so you know right away whether you're being taken are not from a commission perspective and I like that [noise] the other thing is it gives you an easy opportunity\nAnd I like that [noise] the other thing is it gives you an easy opportunity say okay this is what I get so [noise] uh uh making these numbers up but for the sake of the example gold\nIs selling at you know eleven hundred and Ninety eight and they want to give me eleven hundred and fifty that's a pretty fair price they got to make some money that's fine but this other person wants to give me a Lebanon or to even\nThis other person wants to give me ten o nine [noise]\nThen you got a factor in the shipping costs because you're not only have to mail it to them unless you want to get the car and drive I think during the Florida from a mistake and unless you want to get in the car and drive\nUm you can do that but not only do you have to mail it you've got to ensure and the insurance is very expensive because you got to shore for the full value when you're ... so you know that's that's an issue the best place other than that\nIs a local gold dealer because you're going to get your best place prices from a local gold dealer\nUm that that is going to buy buy it from you for just a probably a little bit below par or below spot price so that's where you're going to get your ... best price the downside is that your local gold dealer\nIs not going to have the ability probably not going to have the ability to buy all thirty six\nOunces at one time you know they're going to want to stretch it out but from a price perspective it's going to be the best place to get your you know to get your best price that's going to be the best place to do it at a local dealer if you can find one\nSo I had a a dealer once I had a the task this is way way many many years ago when I was a still managing a and and our trust company and and sewing and you know a manager and a lot of money\nAnd I had a client that had\nSo much silver or her whole entire king sized bed the entire floor space on the mat mattress was filled with silver\nAnd it's a wonder ... gave it to be honest with you and you know we sold out all the local dealer\nBut we had to um do it a little bit at a time but there was a local dealer at a local flea market that um you know gave us a very good price on it and that's how she some of it but\nThat's what I Would look at but they're not going to go in and write you a check for forty thousand dollars to sell it all at once in all likelihood they don't want to do a little bit of time so I Would look locally\nAnd see if there's a you know take a little bit of your goal test it out you know taken out and go over and sell it to see what's going to sell it for the next ... by Ford taken take two answers so am\nI have some cash as well uh I have a oh about ...
