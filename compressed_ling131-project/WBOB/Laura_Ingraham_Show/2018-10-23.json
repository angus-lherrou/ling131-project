Supreme Court justices Senator McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people at the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] that doesn't really capture it in my view\nI one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crash and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri certainly worried about it I mean I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop I made all over the state people ask me that said what's going on and what they said it got us but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course the war to encourage this kind of lawlessness and it's kind of a threat to the country now to have Claire McCaskill of states that this threat sponsoring\nAn open borders bill I I just can't think of anything war so I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing and its highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives the press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that\nHe's at forty seven percent which is higher than Barack Obama was a how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for much they\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country and they're good for Missouri You know we've got a lowest unemployment rate it decades and the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new highs we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but its highest point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas the airwaves grow but\nWhat scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all and reversed reverse all the games and then go back to the policy weakness overseas weakness on our border\nAnd uh you know we just can't have that and that's what this election is about\nJosh has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill\nHarris her and her staff is that resonated at all at the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a very ambitious\nThough I think it's been hugely resident and you know these people to hate to\nTo have a politician and especially in a lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape saying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nTo belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama\nOn everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean at the ... staff was caught saying over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the states who is not ashamed of our way of life and the state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh ah when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but it is it's covered a lot in certainly certainly and socks and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mom's not jobs ah and it seems that people just want things to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that if you had to fill it littered Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offer gets chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this mob behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public banging on the doors of\nThe U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not the United states of America this is not a civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and last intimidate and even use violence against people I mean I have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it as a quarter McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see these mob tactics employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of I'm a conservative religious voters have is the social transformation of the country the the idea that gender is something that\nOf the country the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate the things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing and your state this election cycle\nYou know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion a coup churches to individual you know this is something going on but the most of my career at all the politics here\nYou have the background I Know you do a lot of girls out there [laughter] yeah\nYeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nBut as a religious liberty lawyer and the people are so they are they're minded people\nAh they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value safe and we believe in the importance of value family community thinks built around\nThe churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hospitals are religious liberties just like a talk show through our Second Amendment rights just like to come off all the free speech what do you think about it what what are the left wing with good they're really offered to\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up and that is just not what the people of arts they want people to this country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you I've met many reasons obviously substantive reasons when you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration\nSo forth but I'll tell you why I think\nYou're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous articles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in ... and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a lot of us just surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started reading this today and I'm screaming laughing because it's just like they could say that about pretty much everybody knows office\nWe are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time from the liberal state\nI Do I wear a badge of honor you know and I by the way I'm not going to apologize but all shaking up government bureaucracy you know what I came to office I was on the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOr the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be made more efficient it needed to be a revamp and that's what we did and you know what a great result but I don't care for New York times likes it or dog I promised I Would do the people there don't exactly what I said I Would do and that's all there was a senator to\nYeah mom I I just think it's I mean as someone who has been written about so much Josh man you don't eat just gotten a little taste of it compared to me\nBut I read these things and I read that much differently than most people I just read between the lines like oh okay uh-huh mhm yeah right [laughter] anyway I I think that is the best news this article like the best news I read about you\nAre so

doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in\nAs far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rules claim to be a refugee none of the rules apply so typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare and on getting government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government ... and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nUm we're talking to Rand Paul here in the lower Ingram shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republican than in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective [noise]\nI think the good news is overwhelming it often obscured by the media you know he often being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements center of\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pace over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows the main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says\nThey said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time of foreign foreign but this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are on welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because this is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling at tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money\nTo his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will room when you leave money and the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election it may come to fruition that not only the cabin authentic side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrat the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros than others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democratic party or a Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ...\nWho was living in the United states he was a it was he he was previously a kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he\nYou know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize spent media had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that are not good for America that's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world that teach hatred of Christianity and Judaism and Hindus\nThey're over ten thousand ... says in Pakistan supported by them the Hakani network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they are all the leaders of it went to um to draw a funded by Saudi Arabians\nSaudi Arabians fun madrassas in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam as a big Islamic nation but there there's a growing faction of of those who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis\nI'm not so sure that the Saudis are lesser evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia\nBut Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so no I can think of a reason why we shouldn't be the hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them in what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case may and they've actually assistant American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism [noise]\nYeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and their form of autism that is being sent an export around the world [noise] so uh as far as arms\nThey by sort of are I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nAre armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer the F. sixteen is not something that\nWe could get jobs by selling up six team to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it's about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis actually puts a a set a greater risk\nIt increases the risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos in Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nI Know a gym here who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your view on the show he died many said this\nVery surprising that somebody doesn't miles away\nAnd he said this is a very surprising that some of the success of miles away and he's with us in advance of miles away no access to information or intelligence or this is a judgment call them to senator\nAll this is not the sins of the nation\nOr take a swing it that\nA lot too excited to be lectured by some autocrat from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we should presumed the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven\nOr like a three thousand people in your country that you locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too so I think it's pretty galling for him to western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh we need to presume the crown prince to be innocent it's a dictatorship nothing happens over there that the crown prince begins all\nThe Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist apparently many of them are hench band that travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who their punishment has been being fired\nTo chop up see or to the job of helping the December him and other journalists\nAnd you get fired Mike ... says they're uh they're banished met will be loyal exile somewhere with lots of money the low level people they will probably executed an outlet talked to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and as so no I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...
