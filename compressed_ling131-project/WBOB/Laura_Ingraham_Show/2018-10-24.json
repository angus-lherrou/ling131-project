how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life\nWould go way trinity will consolidate during accounts to the one easy to manage monthly payments reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program\nHis answer to me was that votes have consequences and you will be held accountable and November it wasn't I'm Sorry it was an hour to realize the parallel it was like I'm going to college you even more\nBite of what I've just gone through a and people in Pennsylvania and I just you know just come up with his friends\nCan't understand what would cause him to do something to be so heartless evil\nSo are you saying that he green let this commercial and he in twenty four hours he they wrote a commercial that used or or had an example I'm an anecdote that used your story or that it was already in the pipeline they should have taken a down\nIt wasn't running yet so whether they already had they had it in the pipeline of what they were going I I've I've just found it pretty ironic\nLet's let's tasteless\nYet he was a commercial that had twins with

look at the very least he should have\nJust taken a taking the thing down if he didn't know if it if it was some wild coincidence you should have just taken a down a little bit I think for you for you the best thing to do at this point is to run on the issues and issues facing the country today\nAre are of course if immigration crushed at the border which affects every aspect of our lives from economic to national security and health and and uh all other concerns sovereignty and so forth\nAnd what do you believe should be done with these ah roving hordes of border busters\nWhat they would have listened to me back in two thousand six maybe ... you know we wouldn't have had this problem you know I I I've been a standing up against illegal immigration this is an invasion there was no other way\nThere's no other way to put it and it's people like Senator Bob casey who supporter of support catch and release a that is really just encouraging people at and you know for all these

opportunities to be missionaries or preachers but we certainly can see the proclamation of gospel that has been committed to us by giving to the ministries that are working for the kingdom\nYou just

the real truth the line\nYou heard Mike you mentioned Mike ... he thought Mike Miller reserve the seats and his brother got them and paid for the Mike Miller is the FBI agent posing as a real estate developer whom he had a text message we now learn from a lobbyist friend who said Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM awesome\nNews Gillum responded now he's trying to shape and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well that this story is starting to slip and slide\nAll over the place is a critical race for Donald Trump this is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important or the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign and of course that Florida is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country's going\nBut CNN is even hitting at the FBI probes centers on whether developers successfully influence city projects at one point in the program undercover agent successfully infiltrated Gillum inner circle\nNo one's been charged with any wrongdoing and killings repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but as attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother and a federal agent\nWho went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political opponents to suggest Gillum and potentially under more direct scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be down the road indicted by the federal government given this given the story\nThis is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's chicken first would chip Roy a there's an interesting piece in Politico

how\nCompletely insane Senate Democrats aren't they know that if you want to go on what the house will look like look no further than the Senate committees clown show a lost art\nOut of that you see this the situation in Texas where moral Latino and we and Raymond ... found this out when he went to the Trump rally or this week are a special correspondent there\nThere are so many Latino voters Latino Americans legal immigrants into the United states is and what are we doing this is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously there are going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for yet why do they want to turn this country and to the countries they laughed\nWell there's no course of the really tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail and I talk to you dropped this district and all the taxes\nThe strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether or not a particularly bad acts in Texas or come here illegally they know what they've got a note or ... separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democratic Party particular frankly some Republican Syracuse\nA supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country and so they look the message board or security strong immigration and standing up for our country is selling well and by the way\nIt is much better for immigrants that we have a secure border I'm tired of watching ... sold as a psychiatric industry riding on the train cars Bob's dying it doesn't because we were keep your base are sovereign ... will secure\nA ship ah who we know you're going to do really well ah and we know that uh he will be a force for law and order less government a smart fiscal policy deregulatory efforts where we need to deregulate and we can never let Texas ever let Texas go blue\nBecause Texas just like Florida I'm Talking about this Andrew Gillum isn't here isn't here and then he has a story to tell chip ah but you know we were both states are critical I mean all states are important but the the left has taken over California and we see what the result cannot let this happen cannot let this happen on Texas or Florida\nThat's absolutely right as Texas goes so Google's America you're absolutely right in Florida who does much better state and um they really\nNeed to get that election rock writing I'm quite sure hope will they will but also a say this I Can't bake to adopt grabbing Christians targets on your show the other

getting throughout the state and meeting and can talk and\nHad a big debate the other night uh only state wide televised debate and my opponent chose not to show up only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate\nWell how how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in\nAh both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nUh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm and has been for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nTrying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against them now [noise] worldly\nDoubt out we or Minnesota is turning Brad across the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think Tina let's didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLeft and so a country and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that it's happening on the ground and then she's also a for\nBorders and she wants Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to keep them still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on called for another investigation so Minnesotans are are\nSome of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research\nAnd and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out in the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina's that didn't want to debate nay or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on thing because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fundraising and visit to drum up support for some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of them more vulnerable house candidates I'm But Ryan said there's an enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state\nUh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue ... then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened here so we go for it happened we could have told you what was going to happen um\nMinnesota is definitely turning right we've slipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate and without than sixteen or we've got up on the iron range which had voted Democrat for\nMore than sixteen years is now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and it costs Fifteen\n... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president has joined finally somebody it's fighting\nFor our farmers and quit their issues at the forefront of campaign so\nIt's all it's all the the uh state media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally\nThis cycle here in Minnesota there's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nIs even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know banks that she'll be able to just snuck or the Minnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open\nBorders forget it ... the last thing the mid ... need our politicians in the state\nAnd uh uh senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo route to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current house has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he didn't want it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory\nA car and thank you so much best of luck\nIn that race or for that Senate seat that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to a this Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas debate tonight is going to be critical\nOf by the way oh by the way there's a story I forgot to I was going to

issues is over\nSo that's what we've got going our year will be over in ten days particularly\nWell hopefully we finished the year strongly that to the lord and I know that he is nudge so many of you are so many powerful ways we have been blessed in such a big way we are so grateful I Do know this and I don't want to say\nI'm looking at is what it is and I'm going to be truthful about it we are obvious this year again going to finish in the black\nWe have never had a year in the red two thousand nine was close and I must admit I panic a little bit in two thousand nine I remember it well and then I was very um\nWell I was [laughter] I represented for my lack of face because we came out just fine\nAnd uh this year is not going to be any different but um God continues to knowledge so many of you to give and you know I'm I've said this before but I'm so humbled\nWhen you all get to this ministry not mainly because I Can't believe I I Believe with all my heart that if you give to this ministry you're doing it because you believe in what God has done you believe all God is doing\nAnd one of these days you're going to get more powerful feel for exactly what he's done and what he's doing is we we uh get that out to you in a better bigger detail but it is amazing the work that he's doing here in the ministry and\nUm but more importantly I'm humble because he's not just you God has no just due to be his instrument to keep us on the air and ... and to keep this ministry growing so he's out only raising up so many opportunities\nHe is\nSeen to it that he raises up the funds\nTo help us with all that as well to help us get to that place where he obviously would like us to get too so it's it's a very exciting and uh we will be in the black this year of course we want to finish strong\nSo we've got ten days eleven days to finish a strong and I hope we do\nBut um\nI you know I\nI Know that I could get on the air saying we're going to go off the air here and we're about out of money and we're going to be and you know a trouble and all those things and do you want to keep us on the air I could say all those things but that would not be true we're going to be fine\nYou're stuck with me for another year at least um and of course we'll see but um we've got a lot of a big things coming up this year particularly as we prepare\nTo build out a new studio and of course the expense with that is far more than um I I if I shutter to even think about\nSo we're we're doing that in face knowing that God that God has raised up this opportunity I Believe this is of God to do it but I think he's going to take care of us so um we're not getting ahead of them were going to raise a we're going to wait so we have all the money if we have to stop in the middle we will do that\nAre in weight but we feel very good about that [noise] so\nWe're praying about that and you can do that as well as you think about uh the beginning part um October November particular this year [noise]\nOkay a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three downs up two hundred points man I tell you know all the anxious miss all the oh my word you know China now is retaliating\nIt I I've been using it oh okay well then yeah I Would definitely keep it where it is okay right up\nSo much for your show really got to let it\nAffect you Tom uh let me go to a let me\nYou know what let me just answer a couple of questions on YouTube than we are right back to the phones phones or a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three I'm\nCraig thank you ... just make it a comment on a particular stock or it is a great start looking for very well um\nAnd and ah today you know maybe a good day to start you know to add to it a little bit but anyway great great company [noise] um let's see Tony asking me if I said did you say\nThe forty four [noise] um was a foundational stock no I did not say that I said I was we were talking about ... ah another stock that was foundation or wasn't he forty four though\nI'm don't remember what it was but it wasn't he forty four I'm so it's\nA ... oh I I Know what it was yeah no it wasn't it was in a wasn't even a a energy stuff that we were talking about I remember yeah we talked about the same color that stock but that's not the one that was a pound Israel stock or\nDan is saying uh our preferred preferred valued went inherited\nAt the market or the poor value no a preferred are always\nPart value that never changes now\nThe ... the value of the price can go down or up does the where it is right now if it's cold it's always going to get called at poor value\nIf you inherited it and when you when Harry did it it was Seventy dollars a share and the poor values twenty five then and you sell it\nThen you still have you know a stepped up bases so your costs space is going to be whatever the person you weren't heritage from bought it\nSo from a cost basis standpoint that's how you would figure it's so if they bought it at twenty five and a Seventeen when you inherited it or not when you inherited a boat or a ... on the date of death of the person the your heritage from\nThen yes that would Seventeen dollars would be you were costs basis so if it's now at twenty and you sell it you would have capital gains tax of that does three dollars per share\nSo uh but when it gets cold going to get called at twenty five [noise]\nAh someone's asking me Dan I'm Richards asking me then I have an investment in income stocks I have a nice ah average yield\nUh butter small loss made me from to stocks I'm concerned about one of those stocks does it ever longtime\nTerm upside well I if you're concerned about it I Would sell it I'm not concerned but if you're concerned about it I Would sell it I it's an income stock if you have an income stock you're not supposed to be concerned about any income stocks you only concerned about the income that you're receiving\nAnd as long as you're getting income from it every single my list has a long term upside as far as Oxford so I you know every thing on my list long term has an upside to it\nUm if it doesn't I'm probably going to put it on my cell list but um I Would not be concerned about that if you are truly an income investor if you are concerned about gross\nAnd your income investor then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to be thinking about some different kind of growth stocks so I don't know if that helps you are not Richard maybe it does [noise]\nUh let me go to sue sue is calling us from Texas to\nThe point of fact a sure fire with a plan it and if they thought they were placing hurry up with any of the house a\nGood point and much better\nMuch better points that I made about any of that so yes good point I appreciate your bringing it up because we she was such a strong person in that very important position we pray that God raises up another person as strong as for sure good points thank you for sharing that\nAnd then you know getting it from that point that\nYes yeah yeah exactly 'cause I don't think she's going anywhere she's going to be in the\nIn the life for a while I Believe\nI think of right and then if they bring out I think that we are\nNo doubt about it I'm with you on that to God's praise God yep [laughter] thinking okay I\nLike I said and I are talking point on it or anything about what they found her own little ...\nSelf employed I haven't heard anything about what they found her own company went about one night we currently have three teenagers at home out one isn't it on a four year college the other two are in high school\nI mean they're not even paying for the house with everything they need to pay for college they get bored and they don't wait for that that will solve all our other children as well right now but we had lost pretty happy over the last\nDecade I'm a ... a lot of our our painting but where we are right now yeah kill apartment building\nKept walkway awhile hundred thousand dollars of equity\nI'm a little bit ... hundred thousand and it's a little bit more perhaps we're looking at selling those um and\nSo and then we have about a hundred and thirty thousand dollar mark is on our house we have no other that but we do not have the same thing go like well then you know what we're seeing is that we take that money out of the apartment building\nTen thirty one and it's something out or should we pay our house and then start building a bad fit me open Iraq's IRA you know what it up a plan for it we can continue for work\nA long time because we are self employed and we all know often it but what is it the other\n... right so if you are getting your obviously getting positive cash flow out of those apartment [noise] yeah\nWe are but they are located in another state at about an hour one way drive so that was one of our thought what do we we\nAre a great state of high income taxes and high tech but they will stay at the fact that so now they are they are just so that was one of his knee why we were thinking of selling them and then re purchasing closer to me that\nYou know so um I think that's a fine idea if you're okay having real estate or I don't think you're going to do better from an income perspective in anything to do a better they're\nGoing to be better than the than the real estate\nAnd I think the idea of ... you know I mean obviously I Would find get get some property lined up 'cause you'd obviously understand the time limit there that you have to get that reinvest it but I think that's a that's a great idea\nI I think that you know whether I don't know how much equity a you say you've got about two hundred thousand dollars and equity and you've got two hundred thousand or two thirty on your on your mortgage um I I mean from my perspective based on what you've said I probably would would look at\nUsing the equity to take care of your income needs for your retirement not necessarily to pay off the income or the mortgage now at some point in time when you do retire if you don't work if you stop working then there's always the question of it is you were\nYou know mortgage going to become burdensome uh to to pay for that every month and now the the positive cash flow do you have in this new real estate investment\nIs um you know going mostly to pay that mortgage since you don't have the income anymore and that's where you have to think about I Would probably take the approach that I Would\nI'm\nNot still still leave things the way they are if you work in another five years I Would wait you know that's going to you may be getting to the place in the mortgage where a lot more of your principal and maybe have opportunity with some of the new Josh ... floating you generate to\nPay towards the principal\nAnd relieve some of the time you have left to pay that and I would rather see you do that and I think that makes much more sense so I Would do the ten ten thirty one exchange I Would get that done I think that makes good sense I Would do it sooner rather than later because I'm concerned about this the um [noise]\nYou know the the sale of the
