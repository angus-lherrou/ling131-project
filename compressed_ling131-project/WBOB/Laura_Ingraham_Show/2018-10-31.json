than\nBut I\nThink the Democrats don't want Donald Trump talk about race on [noise] the the Gallup polling on the the the way most people view this when questions are asked with specific [noise] do you think that people who come to this country who are have no legal status\nHere should be able to secure a passport for a child born here [noise] that polling on that if they if if the polling companies wanted to really find out the way people felt on these types of issues you have\nAsk questions with real specificity because again most people are busy with their lives they don't really know what this means birthright citizenship but then when people find out about it because Trump talks about it like what\nFour hundred thousand people are born in the United states to illegal immigrants every year and it costs four point three billion dollars in taxpayer dollars to educate them and to give other federal benefits healthcare and so forth people are just like to watch\nAnd I get outrageous most people\nIncluding in one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the United states which is then the whole state of Montana Jon Tester\nIs in the political fight of his life Matt Rosendale is with us\nOr this racism very close a record amount of outside money coming in to this race just over the past week another six million and outside money poured into the contest just over the last seven days making it\nA according to the uh independent record in Montana it's making them basically one of the most expensive races in the United states and now we're delighted that matched with us now Matt how are you how's it going out there\nOutstanding it's good to be with you again lower\nUh Matt this is a Montana obviously is a massive state it's a lot of ground the coverage that you have to you have to pick\nYour picture places where you go but\nIt would seem to me that the way the American media have attempted to demonize Donald Trump just on the in the last a week or so with these horrible attacks and and on the issue of immigration I don't see Montanans buying that demonization and trying to connect you with that I really don't\nThey John and I'm very proud to stand\nWith the president his policies ... we've had him out here three times and the president will be a company to Bozeman again this Saturday at twelve thirty or to join us again for yet another rally and I and I'm thrilled that he's doing so you know his his policies of\nTax cuts and trying to secure our southern border and reducing regulation and getting these trade agreements in place\nUm has been very very good for the state of Montana and and the people embrace those policies and they would like to send someone to Washington to help the president accomplished more I mean if we can get this much done\nAnd the last twenty months with with a Congress that has not always been cooperative and shortly the Democrats have been as much of a structure this they possibly can goodness what can we accomplished in the next couple of years\nOr how much in a way of love lobbyists um money has test or taking in during his time in the Senate\n... this is this is one of the things that demonstrate just out for from Montana Jon Tester is gone he is the number one recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the country\nFive hundred and thirty five members of Congress we have one million people here and he has received more contributions from lobbyists than any other member over one million dollars over one million dollars and why is that he stood on the stage twelve years ago and said he wouldn't be encumbered\nBy special interests so now he's the number one recipient he literally bought a house to a million dollar high in the Washington DC and left Montana and his rearview\nMirror that well again Montanans are very smart pragmatic no nonsense full and I think Jon Tester talked a good game when he ran and kind of looks like a burly guy and he\nHas put a plaid shirt on and then he comes to Washington\nAnd it just becomes one of the ... mosque monsters in Washington DC and he wants to he wants to continue the big spending ways\nOf the Democrat Party

are with us um and I am convinced that over time all the European countries will come to see that the ... is indeed the edge of the force creating instability in the middle east and then we must apply all possible pressure to push back against that to fix it\nSo the sanctions going place on Monday correct\nYes ma'am Monday and they'll feel them mediate willing to take a little time to settle and\nSaw there already feeling them but uh the days go on the pressure will increase we will substantially drop the amount of crude all their primary revenue source that they could ship around the

in Europe with the rise of ... and the challenges that you use facing\nSo many places where the Europeans work alongside us we clearly have some more um we don't share the same view the president\nHas been wrecked with respect to the Europeans taking increased responsibility for their own security that makes perfect sense most European countries understand that the primary folks who need to defend against the risk that Russia crates hum a reside in Europe not in America\nAnd so I'm hopeful as each of these governments of voices of these that America is with them or help the assist them but they have the primary responsibility we hope that each of these governments will come to see that in the way that President Trump is so clearly laid out\nOn CNBC reported yesterday Mr Secretary that North Korea is reportedly preparing nuclear and missile sites\nFor international inspectors are what can you tell us about I Know you're going to go meet with your not North Korean counterpart just a matter of days but what's the latest from ah North Korea\nSo I Can't say much about what's taking place on the ground but I can make clear that what I was with German Kim now three weeks three and a half weeks ago\nHe committed to allowing American inspectors to come look at a two significant sites\nAnd we hope to get them there before too long it's one of the things I'll speak with my counterpart next week about and then we do have the intention of a President Trump or German Kim getting together for two on hopefully early in the next year where we can make\nA substantial breakthrough in taking back on the nuclear threat from North Korea [noise] we're we're still a happy that they have conducted a nuclear test in an awfully long time they have launched a missile in an awfully long time but there's a lot of work which remains\n... has made clear to me it just as plain as a speaking to lower that he has the into the into the ... and we do everything we can to system in following through on that commitment\nI Want to move to China and Mr Secretary because we've seen in recent weeks nothing that's surprising to see you or me because we've been following this issue of Chinese\nOr stealing our intellectual property and bribing attempting to bribe foreign officials including here at different times in the United states I'm a business officials accuse me to uh gain access to technology a critical technology in manufacturing aviation\nUh and so forth and now we have this chip maker band and are in place on that ... garner and a lot of attention on it's trying to I guess we're trying to target that stayed on a chip maker and ... not over national security concerns\nOr how how is that going to fit into our overall a aggressive stance against this expansive on Chinese a behemoth\nThe lure of a giant is probably over the long term the biggest challenge that scared a challenge that faces our country\nYou saw the indictments of a pet ... Chinese versus for the\nUh the alleged of intellectual property aviation related intellectual property this is a story that's been going on for years this was the first administration that has been prepared to push back against China and we're doing so on all fronts so where the semi conductor peace if it's if it's if it's part of a mosaic\nOf our strategic effort to push back against this continue Chinese effort [noise] uh you know it begins with trade we want president has demanded fair and reciprocal trade with China we've demanded that they not steal our intellectual property\nWe talk with some frequency about the enormous violation of religious freedom a that's taking place against the waiters and try to uh were very worried that China will put the people in many countries around the world in Africa and Central America Latin America\nThe people in many countries around the world that African Central America Latin America in a death trap\nThe OLC ... those countries decades of pain is a multi pronged effort on behalf of all of the United states government at the president's direction to convince China to behave like a normal nation on commerce and with respect to

P. added two hundred and twenty seven thousand private sector jobs\nThat is up considerably from a month before and they were anticipating about a hundred and sixty thousand we got two hundred twenty seven thousand that's a real number that's a real time number this isn't like the number that it's coming out friday\nThis is a real number okay so we've got this we've got this number I'm\nComing out this would be considered non foreign payrolls now the estimates for friday's number is two hundred thousand\nSo we'll see where that all ends up but look we add a quarter of a million or close to a jobs to to this economy we yesterday we saw consumer confidence hit a high that it hasn't seen in Eighteen years\nWe have to go back to two thousand to see the number that we saw yesterday\nPretty amazing so\nUh money and yet and you did an investment accounts\nYou don't have the tax advantages and the tax advantages the differences between your regular old brokerage account where you're using as a joint investment accounts [noise] is different in this way if you buy a stock and it's up Seventy percent you sell it you've got to pay a capital gains tax\nSo it's a taxable there's a taxable event so if ... if you buy a stock for a hundred dollars and you sell it for a hundred and Seventy dollars you've got to pay Fifteen Percent assuming you vote more than a year you got to pay Fifteen Percent\nOn that Seventy dollars not on a hundred and Seventy just on the Seventy that you're gay in a Roth IRA account you have the same stock you paid a hundred dollars for it went up to a hundred and Seventy and you sell it you don't have to pay any tax ever\nOn that just goes into cash and you could buy more you never have to pay any taxes so that's the beauty of the Roth again\nSo it's a big difference and it has huge tax advantages and it gives you the freedom to trade even on a short term basis because short term capital gains is twenty percent doesn't matter\nIf you're in a rough because you never you never asked to pay that it's not the first word in her off till you're sixty five or Seventy or something like that it's not the first you never have to pay\nTax so but again the downside is you can only do fifty five hundred dollars a year and that so maybe you max out your three percent maybe you you have seven eight thousand dollars a discretionary income someday so max out you're off the IRA at\nAt fifty five hundred and then doing the best make out with the rest I mean that's another option right so hopefully that helps you a\nKim okay I'm a four four seven I was seven fifty five thirty three\n\nOr David is eight eighty two percent up on IT twenty nine so thank you yeah a good move David holy mackerel I think you called in the near where you might according yesterday\nBut yeah I'm Glad you're so that's good you can't turn to you you listen uh you you can't knock eighty two percent that's what you did was you took profit that was on paper just like your losses are owned paper that's why I don't want people to sell to last that means you actually took the last year on paper\nLet them let them come up by your profits only on paper to when you go watch it and so it goes down or you can put it in your pocket\nI'm sure David you're like all the rest of it is you're investing to make money and the way you make money is you sometimes you have to take the profit and actually put it in your pocket and that's what you did so good move glad you did\nA let me see Christians saying or do you still like charitable gift and knew what he's um yes I Do uh like charitable gift annuities\nI mean I you know I'm a like a FAA obviously they're uh they have a very very strong annuity pool and that's one of the reasons why I said I'm the ... is there are other ministries that have a strong annuity for sure there are not a whole lot anymore a lot of them don't do it any more because of two thousand and eight\nBut Ah yes it depends on how old you are

P. H. D. P. one of the largest payroll is not the largest payroll a company\nIn the country\nThey do pay roll around the world and that I mentioned that ATP who do you think started ATP that'd be a good trivia question somebody whose name if you are over\nIf you're over fifty you'll remember the name if you're under fifty two thirty five you might know the name\nA deep pie you know that is\nI Would be Ross Perot a two day remember good old Ross Perot he's the guy that put Bill Clinton in office Ross Perot because he was running as a third party if he wasn't running\nA Bill Clinton by the way as much as Hillary Clinton winds about the uh Donald Trump building with them a minority of the you\nKnow popular vote Bill Clinton her husband one with the minority of the vote because of a third party candidate Ross Perot\nMight remember that Whitey pie is ah the coma a combination of all his work and what he did he was the guy that pioneered he was a multi multi multi millionaire he pioneered the

the number one car manufacturer American car manufacturer\nOf that was formed the number one\nForeign car maker was what who makes a what a Toyota may what's the other one is a Lexus or\nAlexis okay so Lexus was number one Toyota was number two so basically Toyota Motors won the uh wanting to\nSlack so Ford won the American motors Toyota Motors won the foreign murders\nBut all their car manufacturers are out now a lot of your own car part\nCompanies they have been an numerous occasions have been on my by list a more than one car parked manufacture\nSo you're probably having a pretty good day and there are stocks uh we got a good day in those stocks warning agreement was reached on trade between Canada Mexico and America so\nThat was very good because a lot of those uh manufacturers manufacturer in Mexico so\nThat was good news so there are a couple of things that we're looking at what's going on right now there's also one of the largest car dealers in the world is
