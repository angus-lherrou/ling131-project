allow\nYou know people that are flag for her to show the non citizen issues to vote in our life since I mean that is outrageous lower and we're going to put a red wall up around the state of Georgia and say no to this being a socialist by here but my radical opponent\nOr she has received a lot of outside support ah which you can't blame her she didn't take anything she gets to try to make a difference in her campaign uh but the Democrats feel like is it if they can turn\nGeorgia to fully a Philly blue then that will be a wall against Trump and twenty twenty what's the key to turning out voters and getting them to see the great a danger\nOf a democratic takeover of Georgia\nWell I think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned about a third base wasn't as motivated Democrats were but with the cabinet confirmations with states statements like these people are finally realizing the real Stacey Abrams you know somebody is going to having fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from the ... you know doing fundraisers with Cory Booker made she said this crazy stateless\nAbout the documented books being part of the only way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the little bugs in the state of Georgia campaign for governor of people are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul of our state look quite for our future and\nIt's not only about me and twenty a day and that's about our state it's about our country\nAnd we're going to buy ...

scholarship to those that are here illegally boats they stand up for it yet but I mean we're literally as you said biting the rest of the country sixty five percent of her money has come from out of state this election\nI have to ask you about this caravan situation or because once again the Democrats are trying to play the\nEmotional manipulation game on this issue where the victims of illegal immigrant crime and the United states get almost no coverage in the mainstream media but the you know the tails and the woes of individuals who are making any long and dangerous track from Central America to our southern border\nAre you know their catalog and their chronicled like you know something out of a Charles curl up a Sunday CBS Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and that's what that's what people are so frustrated with our state but on our country they're ready for governor it's got to put them first of the special interest that made the former\nDirector for ISIS force but under the Obama administration called Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this outlandish comment she made and you know over the weekend she was doing the Sunday talk shows up at the city or New York or wherever she was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers at our families suffer from the hurricane and [noise] you know that's what this race is about to me it's about the shortage versus about our country first\nA head of those that are here illegally you know no one has or sympathy for people and their their\nFlights in their country but you know we have to protect our own we have to have secure borders we can go to other countries can get free government health care we can go to other cultures and get you know free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on hard work at George ... for and people are tired of that they're waking up and they're turning out we're going to put that red ...\nBut we need conservatives across the country to join the bike like others are doing to help or you know drive the socialist radical liberal again to go to jail for governor dot com and helpless if they can't or with their prayers and also their pocketbooks and they were in the ... of our life is not only about\n... about twenty twenty as oil\nYeah camp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website\nHelp out Brian because he has American first on the brain which is where what we need it to be we need the situation handled and the humane and smart way but your your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have\nWith a porous border and absurd immigration loopholes that essentially results and catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian\nI have to play for you or something that Stacey Abrams is a beating on pretty hard which is the\nClaim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're gonna play this and get your reaction much less than\nFifty three thousand people who are being forced to go through unnecessary hurdles to prove their bona fide east but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties thousands of volunteering paid coworkers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this this is his objective standards\nIt would be much easier if he actually did his job and process people in a proper

appealing to shop\nThe United states the lawsuit mania Trump should talk about that too not just because of his own personal issue like if you're a well known person\nOr if you run a business you run

other side ... spend thousands of dollars or more and legal fees why is it that that you don't have to pay the fees it's outrageous love is a state by state stuff\nBut I think this is another huge winter issue for Republicans\nPeople are sick to death of the lawsuits in this country\n[noise]\n\nCall Laura now one eight five five forty Laura\nLee\nThere is this faction in the White House in in the house of representatives is just trying so hard to make the final weeks of the electorate a referendum on hardline immigration policy hard time\nAre breaking through with that message in a big way is not in the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it with hard liners as a sort of regular bitter American politics now that they feel like they were more outrageous we do something that's more offensive or controversial maybe that will create\nNew York times\nOr because he really is in touch with people on immigration\nRight it's not a big issue [noise] let me give you some facts before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest job big poll on the top issue for us voters was back in July\nOr twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and has the highest percentage naming that issue in Gallup history and asking\nThe most important or when they asked the most important problem question uh again mentions of immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking the question\nOn generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd goes on and on about this a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers ... was the top issue for voters in the election\nThat number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the GOP voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same uh but listen to this\nForty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration that pretty much any politician alive today he understands that\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia ... congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in ultimately released\nCongress men I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time we passed a law that this bill or something basses funding stopgap measure will yank their workout learning the president who wants to keep his promises on securing the border you're the lead and bumper where\nThe gentleman that I use the term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words that I'd like for something to do explain to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because\nEssentially what they've done it said if you don't want to open borders than you are mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand the barrier were Dickey was underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nIt was underlying assumptions that I Am all for a robust and help the legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nYou well let me tell you about something that happened Congress men that's what it is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity terrain and knees ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear a categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so\nA bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no a domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his damn or a Democrat guy in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin\nYoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think that moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place it's some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who were on ya um and and so you you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's what's the right that's a joke but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI mean like the upside you know\nThat the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhat I always said except maybe we'll get some some ... UC UC leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is\nBut I mean why now I fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I was going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnger and Congress I'm telling you\nCongress is going to rue the day that that they didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught\nAnd ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWorld without prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador\nOh that is why they're saying here fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYou know well again I think that's you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we got cities with with the homeless a village is ten villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ooh we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with a with rage about the situation a congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV too and we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate\nUh against affirmative action don't go to\nBill O'Riley here my new book in the killing series is killing the assess the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nIt's about Nazi evil and those who enabled it\nThe book Will Stone you as Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than twelve million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nOr are you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect divide the soft as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ransom where is the backup your computer often\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be swimming and money [noise] uh but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a title racism or\nYou know uh affirmative ... you know more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision um you know affirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism\nUm and it it has a huge impact on its missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the\nBelief that diversity is the founding principal of America or is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity at the founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and their law in their defense these lawsuits\nAre that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right but you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to be one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out you see it leads the school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites without practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education you just\nLet people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions color and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know ... year merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nOdd that's we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across this country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well this genie park cruise Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this

B. O. B.\n[noise] welcome\nBack financial issues welcomes all joined us here for the third our I'm Glad you're with us aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three if you want it to your\nCar well we've got a lot going on in the financial markets on this October sixteenth\nAs we uh take a look and see what's happening real quick [noise]\nUh let me get to um the news here October sixteen first of all\nIndustrial production came in three chance a one percent that's a very good number not as good as we would have liked it remember I said Monday I was hoping for a half a one percent we didn't get it but it's okay uh when we look at the industrial productions or the industrial production number and the mass manufacturing number across the country these are very very good numbers\nThe good piece of news that really set the markets that were already positive at ten o'clock this morning eastern time when the numbers came out the markets were already positive but they were struggling for a little bit direction they were fluctuating and struggling\nOr the ... the number came out this number came out in the markets a began that trajectory awkward and that's a they've continued that sings for the last hour\nAnd that is home builder index and home builder index came in positive was sixty was up to sixty eight now is only up from sixty seven\nSixty seven not a bad number sixty eight a big a better number it's not because of the sixty eight number that market started to attend a trend now with the trajectory on the upside that's not why sixty it's not that big of a deal\nBut what it did show\nWas confidence coming back in the month of October and and a lot stronger than it had been and what they looked outwards image or what analysts probably looked at were image or a numbers there were looking at sales and what sales were coming in at\nAt the major homebuilders and what that was looking I looked very very positive and that's where the good news is\nSo at that time the Dow for instance was the opposite that a hundred and Ninety seven points of our member right\nNow it's up three hundred and twenty five points it's up one point three percent almost one at a third that's a significant move the NASDAQ out one and a half percent and the S. and P. is one of the quarter percent\nSo the markets are doing very very well moving in a positive trajectory will hold the other piece of good news\nI don't really think there's good news ox lane in a minute but it is good news to the markets in the sense that it is just another one more indication that the economy is real that the fundamentals of the economy are real the fundamentals of the economy continue to get stronger not weaker\nThe economy continues to do very very well and continue to see gross\nNow the only thing that could take this economy that has a lot of tell when the only thing that's going to take it to the next level to make it even stronger ... more\nTail away and behind it the only thing that's going to do that even more so it's going to be the November elections because even from a\nShort term moderate time period\nThe economy looks very strong and you have corporate America able to make some decisions but the decisions they are making are for the short to mid term moderately long I'll say\nWell why would really get the economy a boost is the ability of companies to be able to process planning a little bit\nLonger to get a little bit of a longer time frame that's what would really push the economy with a little bit more strength aid for for seven o seven fifty five thirty three and\nAnd some of them are going to go up significantly if you have an independent insurance is going to go up now I Know that so many of you to listen to this program are all in Samaritans ministries writes Samaritan ministry right health sharing your\nYou decided to save four or five hundred dollars thousand dollars twelve hundred dollars I heard from one guy I bought it I saved over Fifteen hundred dollars a month\nWith Samaritan ministries\nYou get that uh increase notice you know you don't have to wait for some sort of magical enrollment period to get in or get out I don't know why they lead you to believe that because they they think if they believe and they keep pushing this open enrollment period than what it does it makes the false impression that you can't get out either\nSo not true you can get out anytime you want to get out today you can get out in August she can get out anytime you want\nYou don't have to say\nAll that money that's coming out of your paycheck how 'bout you get it all back in your paycheck and then use half of it to get great\nGreat care\nFrom your doctors and hospitals should anybody get sick and your family because you're sharing your expenses you can go anywhere you want\n\nSo yes Samaritan ministries this is a good time United healthcare up\nBig time three point seven percent that's their stock price is up on the news\nSomebody asked me yesterday about a particular company or health care company is a consumer staples company great company asked me if it's better to be responsible\nI Can't say that it's not physically responsible because\nMarijuana has been hit my screen is hit my screens but it's not had a lot of other screens\nSo the stock is not\nThe symbols MED is not typically responsible my opinion I won't have it ever on my list\nThey\nThey're they're evolving from medical marijuana to industrial marijuana that's their goal\nSome of you\nProbably can imagine a little bit maybe some of you've heard you know some of my testimony maybe you've heard of an environment issues that I grew up in but I can tell you one thing it's never going to be on my list of stocks\n\nAnd you can do whatever you want what's at so someone would want to buy it anyway and not worry about that's fine go ahead\nOr by it but it's never going to be on my list so I'll just say that goes to people have asked me about it and I ... I suspect for one reason or another is coming out by the way these marijuana stocks are going to be big movers next year in the markets\n\nYou can count on it or none of your own it but I you know certainly you do what you got to do\nAll right um [noise] some are\n\nConcerned about economic inequality it's another thing the Democrats are going to run on and they're saying that this is gonna be\nCaused by debt and that would be Moody's saying that\n\nI'm a here's what I'm trying to figure out I'm just throwing a little bit of a blank here maybe you can help me\nBut I'm just trying to figure out\nSo we've got a day\nWe've got that going up to problem I've written about that three times in the last eight months you know about that\nI've talked about member I had a campaign or writing campaign to the president's focus on the economy and talk about the debt to your base in what you're doing about it um we you know I'm very focused on and I get it\nBut I'm ... I'm trying to understand why Moody's who loved to President Obama loved them\nThey they probably have a statue of them in in the office\nThat they pay how much do I I Would I Would guess so so much they love them but you know it's interesting so it's interesting that you know that as they were talking about downgrading the debt here in America they never once talked about\nThe fact that President Obama in two thousand and they said all this data is it's horrible it's wrong liquid George Bush has done\nNine ... nine trillion dollars and then\nAnd then President Obama went on in eight years to add more debt to the economy then it took George Washington to George Bush the ad\nHe doubled that more than doubled it\nDidn't have a problem with that I'm trying to figure that out why would that be women that a little scary got one man is doubling their debts here's the worst part about it he doubled the debt and didn't do anything for the economy\nLet me see I doubled that day yeah but I had three and a half percent GDP Growth no no no you doubled the debt you had a one point eight percent GDP Growth never in the history of the nation as any president ever presided over that many straight years\nOf under two percent GDP Growth never has that happened and I suspect it's never going to happen again\nSo what it would get for all that debt nothing\nI'm not trying to justify the debt that we have right now but at least we're getting a three percent GDP Growth that we haven't seen the fourteen years we're getting prosperity more people working at it that I've worked in some sectors of the economy\nEver we have more jobs and we have people more\nJob openings that we have people to fill them\nHigher then that's ever been in the history of the nation we're seeing wages go up for the first time in Fifteen Years so we have something to show for it I'm not for we need to address it we need to talk about it but nonetheless\nJust say oh man it is just amazing it's just amazing\nNancy Pelosi's putting out her to do list what's going to be necessary for Democrats\nTo win of course she wants her old job back\nBut she's putting out a to do list\n... talking about immigration\nLet me just give you a little comic relief she's talking about integrity and the U.S voting system in the U.S economy\nThere you go integrity Nancy Pelosi yes she said those words integrity in the same sentence that she's talking about America change in America and the Democratic party\n[noise]\nOh boy she does say she wants to stop talking about the wall and the abolish miner by since socialism and all those kinds of things so at least you're smart enough to know that\n\nBut look right now we've got mob rule have you seen or did you see Oregon last week it we've got Marlboro that's what that's what I've always wanted value got Eric Holder Eric Holder saying that it's time for a coup to over throw the Trump Administration\nThat's where he's calling for he's calling for tyranny violence\nA coup riots in violence\nYou know here's the beauty of that I don't want to try to find I don't want to try to put lipstick on that pig but less than\n\nThe fact of the matter is if that happens that's great you know what President Trump can declare martial law and guess what we don't have any more or less kittens would have to worry about the Democrats winning cause when elections\nIs the right to do that we cannot have an election dory martial law so there you go that's grades\n\nPlaying right into\nThe agenda of of a Trump by allowing it to stay in office or without any interruptions that's perfect so there's a good strategy\n\nOh my word a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three we've got something on Facebook YouTube or if you want to do off your questionnaire You're welcome to do it [noise] going to get to those questions as soon as we get back off his re financing where she's a fool for seven or seven fifty five thirty three and four four seven seven [noise] twenty five thirty three [noise]\nSo I suspect unfortunately that I'm going to see oil started to climb a we'll see what we're really worried about climbing their forces gasoline\nAnd that's what a will continue\nTo watch and see how that is to eighty eight national average right now\n\nNational average right now\nMitch McConnell blames the problem with entitlement programs\nNot on the GOP but when Democrats for rising deficits\nI just got finished talking about that President Obama doubled the deficit increase entitlement programs doubled a ton of our programs took 'em to record levels not once or twice but every single month\nOh it's going to take a long time or a fish that that's the legacy left us\nSo\nWe'll see\nChina may have a five four and a trillion in hidden debt\nBecause of the risk that they are now taking five when a trillion China may prove once the trade war gets resolved if it gets resolved China may prove to be its own worst enemy\nYou know it talks about five or nature in dollars of China's in debt everything in China's hidden nobody knows the Chinese economy nobody knows what's going on in China\nWe won't even know what kind of debt defaults we begin to see in\nChina when they start to happen unless they're American companies that are happening too which is very likely\n\nSo you know this all this comes out according to the U.S and the global um ratings talking about the dead but trust me as compete as they know the extent of it and they don't know the half of it\nIf they're seen this kind of debt and they're seeing these kinds of problems and a potential for a lot of default that means things are a whole lot worse than what we're actually seeing right here\n[noise] so obviously this is something that we're going to continue to watch very closely and we need to watch very closely\nGoldman Sachs had an unbelievable earnings report\nUnbelievable earnings reports\nSo what you're going to start seeing right now if you're a fixed income investor what you gotta start saying you're going to you're going to start seeing these high braid CDs starting to come back again\nAnd you're going to start seeing a lot of these come into play because black rock Goldman Sachs couple other big banks are going to start issuing these hybrids\nI don't I I like um they're great to earn some money but unfortunately they seem to never last they always get called but in this rising environment and a a very a cash strong\nSome of these agencies that's what we're going to start to see\nApparently we're starting to see a lot of hatred being rude or spewed on a in Brazilian politics right now as a run up to the presidential election ahead of their I bring that up because of course uh our former um\nBird producer here still working for us in a very limited capacity or what's called doctors are called back to Brazil you had to go back\nBecause he wasn't an illegal immigrant if he was an illegal immigrants so you're working for us but unfortunately was it for us\nI don't really mean that I wouldn't hire an illegal immigrant don't get me wrong but you you know the point I'm trying to make here\nSo\nWe'll have to see it looks like I'm Ted Cruz's\nCampaign is on the ropes that's the concern\nThe U.S obviously doesn't want to um contain China's says mad as some other way or the president a reiterated this morning what Twitter that General Mattis has his full support or he doesn't want to see Mattis go I don't and nobody does I Hope\nHe doesn't do the end of the year but it's looking like there's a possibility he may retire [noise]\nFor for seven or seven fifty five thirty three [noise] to go\nI think we might have some questions for you to face that we'll get to that we'll be right back after this\n[noise]\n\nThis is Nancy where you're from financial issues like every ministry we need to raise the poor to continue when the war\nThe word has for us to do\nOne of the ways that we do that is

not necessarily represented you really is this is the issue of the daily show's moms\nYou know what happens if\nThe Democrats win\nWhat's what's going to happen to\nGreat tax deductions that all the money everybody gets back and they when they get their check they realize oh my word\nI voted more of this I voted this out remember Democrats want to change their way to go back to the old tax so they have to go back they need money can't so they don't have any money to spend they got to spend money they want to go\nMoney they can't they don't have any money to spend they got to spend money they want to grow the power of government listen that's their underlying secret\nThat they don't talk much about it but I guarantee the talking points for Democrats is once we get power we can never lose it again and the only way they can lose it has to make government so enormous\nSewed so many people so depended upon it that they'll never lose another election again so they have to do they have no choice to they're going to do\n\nI Know that's hard to believe but that's exactly what's going to happen\nYou know what we had a goal when you reach you Fifteen thousand we went over that that was
