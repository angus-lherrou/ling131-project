won or happy that that the Senate eventually got\nTo the right result and an outstanding I'm a conservative justice was confirmed\nAnd the other hand I think all of us are depressed\nAbout how how

Republican shit finally grown a backbone\n[noise] ah that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death that I think it'd be a not a guy Neal if he if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have supported a cabin or [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark you you never knew when he was going to go rogue and abandoned his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing all Obamacare\nEvil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spite uh because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person with respect to what is your theory mice half the strongest bases is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nAnd then maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moment a thanks for that call re offend if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's got a lot of attention and it was a link down real clear politics and a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand a people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that post and about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent to conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post and where do we go from here\nOr by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history the Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right that's a pause there for a moment ... the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nAt least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted then lied about but they but they did at least purports to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that uh Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nWas involved in in gang rapes as a high school student is believable uh this mirrors that they the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Canada\nSo I continued uh but the slander the Democratic party directed toward cabinet were if anything even more disgraceful\nWe will feel the impact for many years to come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact that we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the cabinet nomination with John Malcolm a\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of

release dot com today\nA leap into this when everything else failed a hardly surprises me in and you know there may be a perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest a doubt that if I could jam in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left\nAnd that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabin on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that to show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and whatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to close her to be this emotional and I think that it Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions not be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly\nAs strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy\nA reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI think that he he very much helped his uh his cause and had he come out and being at a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm I'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined\nAnd and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this\nWhile I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down\nThe integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because it does involve itself in more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know that is what people are trying to do\nI I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had ...\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving administration and called policies\nNobody was filing or accusers motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage core Tahrir or some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing beach west towards but Kavanaugh who all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side of the judiciary\nA committee you know the impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they both are in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nAnd then it would move to the Senate just as it did when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody has actually grown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh will be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the [noise]\nThe Democrats who showed up as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and all the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nAnd I asked myself why are they so crane is I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that\nThere was with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um do what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there was a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since the election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left they had been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court ah starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to repeal farm\nOr wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court ah would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current\nWhich tends to proceed very very cautiously only one currency Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade to be revisited overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be out light overturned than it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's how ... tended to come to the court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the\nFull frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nDon't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the corner I have no idea exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with the overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going to go to a break that

Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer niche and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up\nWith this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and she said one of the things she Texas okay do you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back\nGood yummy two minutes since so you know be inevitable silos and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reason and now claims that this guy raped or I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is going to show me as willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trips with this\nCon demise guy uh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now so the guy that receives these messages it's going to perfectly rationally and accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration wanted to rack up as many male scouts as possible in its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh\nOccidental expelled the guy he's now he sued the school or that case is yet to be heard but that checked message trail is is completely a vindicate ...\nYeah yeah there is another when you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being raped\nA she texts to the to the boy how two of them were I'm sure the boy checks to her ... how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies you are great and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes\nAs I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that's hysterical\nCompletely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at this magazine\nAh forty three percent of the females\nHomes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is behavior that is completely in on thing couple if you have actually been raped\nYou art that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant\nFrom from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have decks again and and the the key to this whole whole hoax is that\nThe numbers that we have on alleged campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves that same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine\nWhen the researcher asks that girls whom she classified as rape victims\nWhether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not show the ... the phony campus rape epidemic\nA conceit depends on violating one of the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female afterward except if she says she hasn't been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether there's this ... this couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be raped\nAnd then that they combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet hearing that any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask whether it matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know whether I spent forty years and the court room okay\nAnd and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh\nMost witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie but but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd this year the allergy that somehow women are are you know kept you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nSo again let's let's go to remember where the city elegy is coming from it is coming from the campuses\nAnd it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in gimmick racism and sexism\nThat the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearranged we thought that maybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top but they\nThey're put position there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that's gonna kept claim top dog victims status but but females you know we started there early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims\nOf rate of sexism and it's just ... it is it is preposterous particularly on college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged from from the time a girl is five years old today on where she is the in\nIncessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women and stem girls to code\nAh encourage them it right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys who are in the afterthought who are bombarded with the message that they are at the ... they are the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses\nAre the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point mail to just get a check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the value but at the same court room\nYou know the reason that we that the western tradition developed these\nTruths finding mechanisms like cross examination was with the understanding\nThat human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things that didn't plant memories syndrome that we know about you know we don't know with the Christian for\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know\n\nThe thing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think is probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following\nClosely the phenomena that you describe Heather on college campuses they've got a burst into public view here with the accusations against a judge cabinet or a but this is the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention to it if you've got a child going off to college [noise] you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself and and the rest of us have to realize\nDon't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating the victim ideology\nUh it's not just about the Democratic party although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by candidates identity politics that is poison for civil society it's teaching students they hate\nIt hate each other and I hate the greatest works at what civilization and they're carrying that animosity and just the world at large that's what we're seeing today\nYou know it's great that cabinet get on the Supreme Court because his wealthier record of jurisprudence shows that he's a careful purists that that

I Would look at those first I Would look at you know um [noise] you know pick one I don't know if you pick energy that's fine and then you know next time pick one of the other ones but that's that's what I Would look at\nAll so I don't even know what I have on my list you know and not worry\nOh look at that at all watching trucks won't be it is as we go along good so um I guess the last question as we go here is um [noise] so I Would go to the one sector and buy like one or two stocks and then is that okay I don't need to buy any more ally now that I'm\nSo\nThey ended up buying everything I don't want to be overweight it in one you know what I'm saying\nSo you're obviously you're going to be ... you know you're going to be overweight it because you're you're gone\nYeah right you're on a little bit of time [noise] so that's fine I wouldn't worry too much about that but yeah I I Would just wait and see what cycle through again so what I mean by that is let's say you buy some energy\nAnd then you know uh the end of the quarter you buy something else and so on and so the adventure only you're going to come back the energy and then you can add a you know another one or two\nOkay so ... around my ass allocation model on Zach I'm stocks and there's great my lesson just go from there\nYes exactly yep\n[noise] well you know money that's it so hey God bless you man what's your view\nThank you I appreciate I Hope I see a New Orleans\nYeah you probably you're probably gonna excited about it I Want to see how much do you watch already and uh and by the way I thank you for like saying what you say about what's going on with our our\nOur government right now and I agree with everything you say and then managing sorry you're just an amazing man we appreciate it\nThank you brother I appreciate your saying thank you so much ... about\nA four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three eighty four four seven seven fifty five to thirty three if you want to hear your call You're welcome to do that um somebody is ask a Gary is saying on YouTube\nGary's on YouTube and he says or what percentage of my portfolio should old folks [laughter]\nUh have in micro or small kept you know Gary\nI wouldn't listen if you're going to avoid it I wouldn't have any Mike Rowe caps\nAnd I'd be careful about the small caps I mean if I had my druthers and I could say look you know um you could you could do this I I Would rather have just nothing but make capital large gap I think that's always going to be\nThe safer safer way to go a ... you know so I'm not saying when everything's down they're not going to be down is not what I'm saying but they're not going to use the just not going to be as volatile they're not going to take the biggest swings so when everything's really climbing up crazy they're not going to go off crazy\nA like a micro cab word belt when everything is down they're not going to go down a crazy like a micro cap would and I like that so I Would I Would rather you stay um\nYou know the larger cat stocks the better so micro cap probably out altogether way too volatile a butt and small cat and maybe one in a sector but I'd rather stick to them in the large gap if he can do it\nSo hopefully that helps you somebody's asking about Patrick does asking what are the two best energy\nI'm stocks I guess\nI'm\nStocks I guess he's um I guess Patrick is saying that he's he's just starting out maybe and I'm asking what the the ah three best energy stocks would be er two two best energy stock\nUm\nI don't know I you know I Know so I don't give out um\nParticular stock names because I don't want people that shouldn't own their own it you're young\nOr so you know you ought to be or I Want to be fairly aggressive that's what you want to do you want to be aggressive and um\nSo I Would uh\nI Would look at probably I Want to give you the name of the numbers on the stocks but I Would look at an e twenty six for certain that is one that is I'm\nOn my list is a very long it's a very long a term stock but a good one\nI Would look at it ee ee I'm\nYeah I don't know that's probably that's been that's been going up so much but how about um the forty four would be another just a good old solve stock or to have\nAnd the other one is is very long term stock or you know what this one's probably better maybe look at a ... forty they're off my by list so I eat a forty a and a twenty six\nAnd a eight forty four they'd be a great place to start but any any two of any one of a you know any one of those by to pick to it probably be a a forty three and a forty\nOr forty and eat twenty six years ago he forty and he's twenty six so hopefully that helps you pay for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three if you want to hear your coffee You're welcome to do with the four four seven o seven fifty five thirty three\nI'm folks I Do want to remind you it is a month of October and you know we think all this stuff you see all these protests all these this craziness that you've seen for the last seven days in the news over cabin or you know what that was about\nRight now is about roe versus Wade wasn't about anything else they say well I was about it was it about any thing else they are scared to death they don't the people protesting they don't know why they're scared\nThat underwater scare there just scared because they're told to be scared but the Democrats were scared to death over roe versus Wade\nNow I don't know what's you know first of all there is no case\nThat I Know of even remotely maybe there's a case working its way out but I don't know of any to the courts in reference to roe versus Wade\nJudge Kavanaugh made it clear that is a stylish all so you know it wouldn't be an easy thing to do or he didn't indicate whether he would do it or not but that's what they're concerned about\nI Believe that roe versus Wade is dying of a thousand cuts we don't have to get it overturned Stein of a thousand cuts between the states and you know everything else is dying I get sick of a couple of cuts\nCan we please stop using my tax paying dollars to fund Planned Parenthood that's won't cut that we've got to be working on\nYou know little things like the heartbeat bill and and uh the limits are doing the thing that we're doing here at financial issues as we are trying to slow the one point two million babies are going to be aborted by supporting pre born\nDot org that's ministry that we've come alongside that they have come alongside us\nAnd we have said tens of thousands of babies because you guys have\nSponsored five ultrasounds at a pregnancy to a hundred and forty dollars and I'm asking you [noise]\nTo celebrate disappointment by going to pound to fifty that's the phone number down to fifty\nFive years and this and the last ten years I mean that's always it's always good to look at that and see what kind of\nA dividend to Spain and those kinds of things\nI'm a ... and ah you maybe you begin to you know form some\nAnd uh you maybe you begin to you know formed some opinions of you know about all of that but I I Would never discouraging that is for certain and but the idea is and the goal is that a year you know I'm doing\nA a lot of that it doesn't mean I'm right you may discover something if you're if you're digging in there you may discover something that that you you know you you are you feel it's a very important part of what we're doing and you might choose to go down that\nThat road and that's fine that's fine too so I think it's always a good thing to do I want everybody to learn as much as they possibly can ah my goal was to make it to make it is easy\nAnd uh have a a trustworthy source that is going to make sure something Democrats responsible and something and something that is um\nYou know as good an investment as I possibly could be\nOh actually said her very much so I'm at my age I'm kind of an answering\nSecure Seventy five years old but we have around ... hours and hours and my wife and I think you know invest in it and some type of mutual fund or index why mhm um and I\n... after buying your stocks and not paying any fees to anybody I call them trying to stick down that route but how would I Would I just called in and talk to them about my goals and they could guide mayor\nYeah I mean they yeah they you could I mean there's no index fund out there that that's basically responsible\nUh and or or each he asks for that matter a Timothy is going to have um an ATF at a at some point in time I'm sure some series of vps but um you know there there are large cap\nGrows fund is going to kind of a track along a little bit with some of the indexes but you can call them and get some help if you want to do mutual funds you're probably not going to\nLike mutual funds as much now as you might have ... you know only because they they don't uh\nYou know they don't they don't track the market quite as as uh the same way as a as as nothing wrong with I'm just saying that's just you know when you've been doing so what you're doing a really Peter and I try to\nEncourage people along this line you're creating a mutual fund so you have a portfolio that has various stocks in various sectors that's a mutual funds to\nAnd you're building in ... and you're building a mutual fund your portfolio is a is a mutual fund it's nothing more than a lot of small positions in you know a number of different stocks and that's where mutual funds are\nUm the differences with your mutual fund you can sell one little small piece out of it\nOr you can buy an ad one small little piece to it so you have more flexibility so you could say you know what the stocks up thirty percent I'm just selling out of it and I'm going to put that money somewhere else and you're able to do that of course you'd you you can't do that you're depended on the manager of the mutual fund to do that\nSo um you know it's a but certainly you have you have this money and that's a good thing to kind of a take a look at it mutual funds should be even more so designed\nFor holding you know not trading not managing much just buy it and just forget about it uh but yeah I mean you can certainly called Timothy Noah guide you through that process and and help you out there\nWell actually everything makes total sense that's what I'm doing is going across the spectrum of the sectors that you recommend stocks and making my own funds yeah and then I'm doing some in\nThe first fight for al ...
