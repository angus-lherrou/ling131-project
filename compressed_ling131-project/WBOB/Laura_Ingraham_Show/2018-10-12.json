times that we heard that question raised so it goes to the Confederate flag Robert release statues none of that creates a up one job for African Americans\nNot one job but they beat the drum why why did they beat that drum\nYou're listening to your health the radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so Connie continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nMake and you know I can get to see that all the time to fly by the guy\nIt was a lot of\nIt makes you feel like Superman made a\nFavorite superhero and your mayor Superman\nFor me so [noise] Donald Trump or that someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transpired Jeb Bush they said that ah they're Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose and a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we now he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow\nAnd I'm someone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut they do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that comedy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West's let's listen to\nHis father having another case someone help him and the guy them I mean he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nGo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were\nAt the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts\nAnd George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be on and on human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I I Will go okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people have devoted their lives for this oil I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did\nThey never raise the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room Katy\nPerry running around college campuses ex trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy if it bit him in the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go up\nAnd\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage of the news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans\nAre decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate\nHelp markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plans I pay you back\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with what we're co pay more choice of like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nYou know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress he nights with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are they are more and more angry\nAs long as you know the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is a driving them I think to a\nA two to this unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was a interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have when the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nJustice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can make those qualifications\n\nYour reaction to that [noise]\nI Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area mildly suspicion was he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nUh who are who are we're seeing the create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd senator and what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the midterms me you heard back or very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n... touch in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nMid term elections we usually see down there in a turnout but uh I picked the Kavanaugh hearings have energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said while he would have voted for\nA cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and Chuck turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just back on account on an issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to fund discussing what next\nWhen the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick the incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report or a or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions elites now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nI have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then linked then send it to the FBI after the initial um the initial hearing than it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff for the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm most cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly did the ... Dr Ford's interest very well in the way she handled all of this\nBut yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this ah ... they'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward\nThat names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans\nAnd how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation assign\nGot there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it\nAnd someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal jurisdiction\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh Ogden I hadn't really thought that much about it perhaps there is and that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nA Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower end up show senator or for the next uh you know three and a half weeks list is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much I mean Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the presidents he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nThe president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time law I mean the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but really this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right\nAnd so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or on Capitol or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly on Missouri\nDid not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that uh that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other\nCelebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know hub for this president and uh I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry\nHis his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was at that reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has is that near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a marriage or the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's just drive he makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or Russian rational ways and\nAnd uh we've seen that look to the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I think this we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the city so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judges to the bench\nNow my guess is the judicial branch to co equal branch of our government\nArticle three judges and we need more Trump nominees on the bench and many declare those are clear those through\nThe whole nine four to six oh seven oh five\nAM six hundred WB you'll be

sausage is made with legislation it's ugly like so I don't have blinders on when I talk about politics but\nI sometimes think my friends that I have friends in Hollywood writers and directors and producers and actors and singers\nI think they flipped through a newspaper or read a magazine article and because they know some politicos assume they have insider knowledge or understanding that elude the audience I Would argue they don't\nAnd sometimes there because they have a louder and larger platform their voices heard more than others and that can obscure reality for them and for the people listening to them so with Kanye West here's what I say take it with a grain of easy salt\nListen watch it it was quite a show yesterday I got to say but I don't think no matter what you think of Kanye West I don't think it was an assault on the White House he sat at the resolute desk talking to Trump respectfully he yeah he used language that I wouldn't have used but\nThat that's that's

P. Morgan reported and that that got things kind of moving towards a positive\nDirection it's very good also it seems to be somewhat solidified I hate to say that 'cause I don't really know that it is but yesterday there was talk that President Trump and president Xi from China we're going to need it the jeep twenty some it\nOr the second I think it's a second we third week of of November and they were going to have a\nPrivate meeting to talk about trade and tariffs\nSo you know I wasn't too excited about it yeah they said that it came out of the White House it that's a possibility and all that well now it looks like as of this morning private markets opening it looks like that's a done deal\nSo it looks like there's going to be a meaty\nThat's very good news and I'm sure I don't think it did a lot to drive the markets one way or another\nBut it had to help a little bit at least if you were leaning can ... really super concerned about us China trade relations you moved to just being concerned\nInstead of really concerned so you know it probably a little bit but\nLook it's going to be a trade deal there's gonna be a trade deal\nBut how do you know the I I'm telling you there's going to be a trade deal and I would suspect there's going to be a trade deal\nNot that I Know oh okay well it is\nSo you can move that over into a you know an investment account anywhere you want so let's say you open up in the trade account or a you know ... somewhere a brokerage account you could move that money over there\nAnd then you can begin to work on you know a building your portfolio\nSize so the first thing the question you want to ask is\nI Would form a light as I looked at my statement\n... whatever the last statement was my I currently I you know the date of the statements I had on making numbers up but I have fourteen thousand dollars in there mhm\nSo if I decide I Want to uh I I may be thinking I may want to surrender their contract\nOtherwise you turn it back in and get be done with it may be wanting to surrender the contract\nSo I Am assuming I'm going to get fourteen thousand dollars if I Do that\nOkay and\nSee what they say [laughter] that'll that'll be that'll be a great opening conversation to get you know to find out what the deal is now they may say yes that's right but would you like it's the whole taxes\nAnd I would say yes if there was a taxable portion will not hold those taxes but make sure it's not income tax and all that that it's not a qualified plan you know make sure that it's not considered IRA money but that um\n[noise] anyway that's that's what you want to ask them today or whatever\nOkay All right okay well we'll go from there it sums up I'll call you back\nThat sounds great I sure do or virtually thank you Judy I'm Glad you're a listener thank you Bye bye Bye bye let me go to Helen Helen is calling us from Tennessee Alan\nHey Dan how are you today ...\nDid a same here we're partners okay let's take it for about three three months and we are in\nThe three savings account with my husband worked at the post office okay can now Seventy four and we've been taking an allocation every year every month ... patients from that this year we're taking a thousand dollars a month\nUm we we're we're we're in the sun to ask sun and we're in at forty three percent that the sun at eleven and the sun at forty four here that pretty probably aggressive for our age yes\nBut it has worked really well up until this week actually taking money out and have the you know we've kind of stayed the same leave not decreased any until of course this week and we have but we roll with that yeah anyway we we're trying to roll it over to explain to track\nSo my questions are being in contact with Timothy I've got the application in front of me\nI just need to know where to put that money in the end of the plane I see your allocation from age group\nSure no let me ask let me ask you this Helen ... out of out of that money how much is in the G fun\nBut it's Jason how much money I mean ... percent roughly ... roughly look\nUp here it's a shared prices the balance would that be a lemon thousand two Ninety three thirty eight okay\nSo\nIf you were to move to Timothy when you're taking a thousand dollars a month now [laughter] now I Would assume you don't have any problem with\nThe pleading I mean you're so you're obviously kind of on track no matter what what you do or where you go with depleting the money mhm you know at some time and then not too distant future\nBecause it's the it's right now has about Ninety three thousand you know it was about Ninety eight the beginning of the month beginning in the late playwright\nSo and and so if you're in a place where you're going to continue you know as long as you can to draw that thousand dollars a month sale which is which is fine\nBut if that's if that's where you are now than I Would look at\nUm [noise] I'd I'd be careful about\nKnow where so right now and it failed in dollars a month you're going to draw that out for seven years eight years I'll say here's the politic um than than\nYou're able to take 'em then then then it's going to be gone what my concern is and this would be the same concern with the city in the ... as well is that\nSomething could happen like it's happened this week that could be pro long\nUm you know for an extended period of time which would create the ass and the sea fun going down you know maybe significantly\nMhm and you're eight years now is going to go or making all this up but you just to draw a picture so the so the eight years now is going to go to six years\nBecause of a thousand dollars a month [noise]\nI wouldn't want that to happen so if you're staying in the S P\nI I Would want you to consider\nHaving no and I don't know that it's a media but certainly by the end of the year so I think you're going to recover what is been down over the next couple of weeks and and then even then some depending on how the elections go\nSo I'm okay stay in ... where you are but at some point in time and the next year or so if you stay in that she has to be that I Would want you to move the asked in the ... over to the G fun when you've got a pretty good profit in their moved over to the G front\nThen I don't think there's anything else you can do because it gets too risky every if you're drawing let's say you're drawing a thousand dollars a month\nAnd this is after you've gone through the eleven months in the G fund and you've got to nail draw it out of those the NS fund you you know ... those funds are too volatile they could go down easily\nAnd again cut the time off that you have\nNow they could go up and add to the time\nBut it it may be a little bit too risky for me to tell you to do that\nBecause now I Would suggest that\nIt may be\nI don't know that I Would want you\nTo move to Timothy because Timothy does inhabit gee fun I mean they've got a fixed income fund which is similar to the ... and\nUh and and all you know government bonds but it's not going to allow you the same rate all the interest that the G ... does\nSo I think\nAnd the G ... would be about as close to biblical responsible as you could get staying in the tea SP it may it may be totally biblical responsible actually 'cause it's a disappoint it's all government bond fund so [noise] I\nI Would I think it might be better for you to stay in the CSP okay\nBased on what you were telling me now if you said to me you know what we we decided we're not taking any more money out we don't need it that would be a different story but just because of what you've told me that's why I'm saying that\nAnd the reason we're taking the thousand is to diminish the money to get it out of that we don't pay much taxes because that's how we can take out without paying taxes on it every you know and he came back\nAnd that is great great strategy so if you're taking that out or you're saving it somewhere else\n[noise] no no no not really okay All right that's filed we don't spend that much anyway right right the Caribbean and have the little engine sure do it\nIt just made it easier living\nGotcha yeah no I think I think you're ... you know you're on the right track I Would stay but I Would just stay in the G fun I think it makes the most sense\nOkay I'm not sure I Would love to hobbies or partner I'm not you know and I'm not trying to discourage you from going into Timothy I loved Timothy in love with Timothy is doing and but everything you know I I I wanted to be right for you and I think that would be the thing to do\nAnd the other thing we we told our home and we have\nLet that we need to do something with the focus of show to serve that would be something if you do partner that would be something to look after your income for polio [noise]\nOK\nStocks and the other way and it and that\nWe're doing well with this gap and it's going to get to the point where I'm going to be able to sell them at a good profit when I Do that and I tell all of them can you walk me through how I use the anti Darren how many shares I should say at one time it's like five hundred the Mac\nSo when you sell them you want to sell them\nKind of an AK yeah so when you sell them you want to sell them for the current price that you\nThat your show you know that it's showing when you go to place the sale but you don't want to put a market order and say you want to put a a you know a limit order so that if it drops starts to drop down below that price\nIt won't sell so generally what that happens I don't know of five hundred shares it would\nHappen I think let's say five hundred shares I think it would probably sell at the price you want I think you'd almost be doing it safely doing it or on a market order but if you want to be certain then that's what you would do so you may see oh yeah we sold\nIn the same day you may see we sold a hundred and Ninety seven shares then we then you sold sixty shares then you sold you know another thirty shares in stone a show for it and you may see the confirmation on the sales come through like that\nBecause what it's doing is every time it drops every time it goes up to the price you want it's triggering a sale but it only as time maybe to execute you know a hundred and twenty shares before drops again\nAnd and that's where that's where the half for each time that no no no no okay\nWell now there won't be the only be one fee it's one cell order so there are only be one tree\nAnd shit I consider the day of how I
