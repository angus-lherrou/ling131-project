individuals to come to the United states we need to cut off those Meg that's the president's attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise]\nYou know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what other a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out circa ... cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states they could also uh you know\nChange the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum in Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where a company daily in a miners have to be released after twenty days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they are ... and it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game they want to they want to pull the heartstrings and America and put these Republicans back on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages he want to put a baby how many times have we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... you know we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that in order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for\n\nThe trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders or the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as a border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any contraband that child travel through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous drone states is beyond the ...\nWell when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it cost to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect the administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor this is another incentive again you went back to either of the people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their slug we're definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so that was a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case if that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking about you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under orders for local they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing\nEverything that they had coming to them they've had but they remain in the United states continue to work here again we have no ... no way\nTo verify that there are leading in\nIce just lack the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people [noise] plus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a file order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work ... any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in\nArt and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter who travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the coach coaching really occurs\nThat's where you get the you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be the same and I fear for I think from my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions\nWants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that for a\nMind security bill I think it was attached to that bill [noise]\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or is it the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five percent of all people who claim credible fear found to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual is removed from the United states\nDa chest needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to the H. S. so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical\nWell and also uh as as he or someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing but think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse\nIt hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate a local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding and or a review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation of place that actually prevents the United states government says the gate and whether or not\nThat claimed took place in her country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum pursuing we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means

the trafficking victims protection that we have to actually a handover unaccompanied alien minors to ha chess and agents or the department of the United states government that really doesn't\nDo this

basically to favor the rights of the illegal aliens\nThan they are the rights of citizens eggs a theme that Trump is put on this is a big issue and it's across the board um and and um it change moves votes as does the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the cabinet or stop the numbers probably already been more important which is the\nWhen the argument that the Democrats if they take the house\nAre already many of them pledged and we now have their chairman hum of there to be chairman and if they win this year and committed [noise] I'm sharing that are saying\nWhat we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations a great belief that this will disrupt the economy\nAnd I'm a sense that um this is going to be ... chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presidents and whatever then I say we know that their agenda\nSomehow time had come to just to recap so some issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nDr noxious or yes but we'll remove it was a number of Democrats and many independents civil moving the third big issue for us is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me uh you know the dams as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment\nMob I'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of ... or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least\nMuch more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the middle\nWhat democratic socialism but you've covered all with the idea of chaos you know whether it is banging on windows they are going to disrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYou know some of the law and order and I'm not in front of them hold on let me just again law and order safety law and order ... the respect\nPalm respect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been ... we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have health care and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but ah my except for the fact that both the cost is because that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nThey've so say the Democratic socialism on that bothers people and then the policy does\nOkay is can't hold on this is what Nate Silver of course IV\nPole and now he's the he's the ... this statistical a journal and he practices statistical journalism um and he you know he didn't get the prediction right in twenty sixteen uh but this time and he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a productive assumption standpoint he sent a foreign science chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability it might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable\nFacts and when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I agree with them and it's very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have ah the selection that there are many many things that are under law in this election most of all by the way is one elected trumping sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that that has been made and they they have that anti Washington anti elitism still exist in very great with\nThe issue has been from the Republicans can nationalize the election I still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do\nAnd it's more effective because guess what when you buy network advertise you to be inside of shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize because then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be for people who were in the out party that the ... the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade between the the\n... when you put the big issues in front of people have consequences then something happens and I think the Republican giving him all the candidates are doing a better job but frankly the passion and all those they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do 'em to mash them further national\nPolite and now we have not\nJust the local election out is is it a national election and people need to understand the choices\nBecause there are concerns are very great again the Kavanaugh hearings beginning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this incivility arguments rats and she had some numbers yesterday\nA lot of restaurants in the argument is that in numbers yesterday that showed overwhelmingly judging of the Clinton proposition even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know this notion that you can't be civil so when I'm there is and the things at the end they bullied by the way\nBy a large variety that if the Democrats win civility we'll get more\nThan usual become worse than they are\nNow I Want to play an anti philosophy for you or this is below sea uh discussing Trump's desire for a wall especially given what we're seeing all these new migrants ...\nIssue\nManhood issue that ties into what an ... to be the last question they peace people say the year the woman you have a lot of these ... interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans and some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one that could also be the year of the man\nAh because well our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked in the cabin out at at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the man uh and and again I come back to it's not just wrapping up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share of Democrats who are not happy with the way things these the the prospects are going and it is an heritage really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to the larger consequences of what happens if you will while the Democrats take over and what will happen\nTo the country I think is assembled a simple formulation simple formulation mobs versus jobs resistance versus results\n[noise] forward or backward\nWe're going forward we're going up not down they want to kick they want to kick you and your down they want to kick you when you hit hard okay we're going up we're not going out looking back

[noise]\nWe've got phone lines open a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three\nIt is September tenth\nMarkets or fly nothing happening so that's where we got nothing happening\nHey we've got a lot of economic do them a data coming out this week\nOr the most important piece of economic data this is just my opinion\nTo pieces I'll say one I'm kind of a non event I really don't care I I Do care very much about it it's very important but I'm reasonably certain it's going to be good I probably shouldn't say that\nBut and if I'd be the small business administration small business not administration small business and the national federation of independent businesses small business index\nAre coming out confidence index coming out and um\nI it's ... it's going to stay out by I Can't imagine this is an August number were sitting on a seven point nine or ... wait for all practical purposes\nCan't see it go much below that can't see him going much above that but it should probably I think the needles to move up a little bit from one o seven point not just because of the numbers that we've seen the other really important numbers industrial production\nAnd that's coming out that's also an August number so industrial production or one of the most important numbers we have in our economy\nOr something we watch very closely or we should be watching now we got in the habit of ignoring it or not we shouldn't say way I don't wanna throw me in that category 'cause I never ignored it [noise] but um the the mainstream\nA financial news gotten the habit of ignoring it because\nI'm the industrial production numbers kinda contradicted everything that was happening in the Obama administration so uh what all the things they were a towel team or the industrial production contradicted it and you do not by the way you do not a a a kind of almost any economy\nBut American economy\nHas no growth unless industrial production um and and and productivity if those two things aren't up you know really have any growth you could say have grows you always say I grew up and you can pretend like you have to grow you can do that too\nBut\nYou don't have any growth was it an interesting how about this\nPresident Obama\nTalking about this good economy is because of him wait a minute all the Democrats are saying this economy stinks all the Democrats on the ... say this economy is not good [noise] how can you say it's good and they're not and then they got a thousand reasons why this isn't a good economy\nSo ... ... ... who's right here so then President Obama didn't create a good economy Oh yes he did well then it does is say oh no it's things just say just thought I'd throw that out um\nI just found that interesting because you got to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on one side say and all the Trump hasn't done anything what is he talking about what a time and you've got\n\nPresident Obama saying buses or you know comedy is good but keep in mind that there might number\nOkay\nAll right we're going to have to fight that look if the if the left it was had any sense whatsoever\nThat would just kind of drift right on by right through this happened now morning she just keep talking about Russia how about that because you're just making fools yourself talking about this economy so why don't you just\nGet paid for the November elections talk about ... got to be something out there you can talk about um\nLet me think why don't you talk about um abolish the nice how about that how did you talk about the evils\nOf law enforcement there you go there's a winning and you talk about the evils\nMaybe maybe you can get that an eight hundred number that if people are being arrived that they can call instead of the police maybe ah you know\nSo the the um sprayed between the ten year and a two year is increasing you know everybody was talking to me and I didn't spend a lot of time on this because I didn't want to talk about it because I didn't think I thought it was irrelevant 'cause I didn't think I was going to happen and it didn't but they're spread between the two year and a ten year\nHas grown and continues to grow and let's hope we can hold\nSo yes the ten year moved up the yield but and so did the two year but the two year didn't move up at the same rate that the ten year did so therefore the difference the gap\nIncrease and that's a good thing as we look at the economy and I'm Sorry I don't have that uh exact number in front of me you know what I might have it for her to do about that so the ten year this morning hates wow free point to one quick point to one early this morning\nSo the two year had a hit two point eight to eight I remember when the ten year was two point eight eight this year not too long ago so\nBut the spray it had changed so that ten year increase five point seven basis points the two year increase to point for basis points so that increase that difference between the two in the den and that's very good\nAt the Federal Reserve power spoke yesterday and he said the economy is a long way away from neutral now\nMaybe some of you heard that and maybe some of you are right some things about that because I Know you're so much more in tune with economic data because you listen to this program but let me just explain to you and I hope we are\nSo neutral when you hear the term neutral when the Federal Reserve talks about it he's talking about the point at which interest rates this is their interest rates going up like they did last week raising\nThe interest rates\nNeither affect the markets where the economy in a good way nor do they affect the economy in a bad way\nWell that's kind of what happened I bully last week it really had no impact on the economy one way or another but the fed says no that up a chairman pal says no that is not the case at all we are a long way away from ...\nWe're a long way from neutral\nBeing that whatever the fed does really doesn't impact the markets that much [noise] the one thing I wanted to mention it to you and I I did a two minute on this and then I deleted it because it sounded too much it's sad to\nSay either too sarcastic means and mean spirited so\nI guess I was very early it was three o'clock this morning\nSo I listen to it it's in there and I think so but basically what I was talking about what's shaping Morgan came out and said that talked to was an article say J. B. Morgan says that ah the because of the Federal Reserve market cap and he has to be has lost one point five trillion dollars\nIn that uh Shay who cares\nYou really care what in the market was when they asked me it was all is up fourteen percent Fifteen Percent over the last twelve months\nOnly bank could whine about that there's a bank that has been living off cheap money for so long impacting their bottom line making billions\nAnd billions and billions and billions of dollars for the banks over the last seven years Steve ... these are the same fat cat bankers the President Obama despise for making so much money off of President Obama\n\nAnd they're whining about it oh no that sort of be terrible and oh my gosh yes and he's only up who cares about whether or money is impacting banks in the way they how much profit they are making\nAnd I thought they are what I like to think about was what a ridiculous statement to make Ninety two percent of people surveyed this year they don't trust the bank\n\nNow you know why this would be one of the reasons\nThis is why I talk about Christian Community credit union you're still dealing with a regular old but I think that the only Christian Community credit union you need to think twice about that I wrote an article about it when the survey came out a couple of months ago about this notion that Ninety two percent of the people that's worse than the ... rating in Congress\n\nI mean Congress ratings are higher than that not by a lot but there are higher than that there are at least somewhere in the low double digits eleven percent or so\nI guess Congress has more family and friends then do bankers\nThere are whining about what the fed the ... speaking in a very hawkish tone this is me saying that's not the banks not J. P. Morgan\nIn in a very hawkish tone this is me saying that's not the banks not J. P. Morgan but it's what they alluded to speak it at a very hawkish don't we've seen drops like we did yesterday a forty four\nPoint forty four percent oh my gosh\nAre almost half of one percent drops because the fed is losing market cap\nSays why people don't like the ... so I don't own bags front on the back so I have a couple of small community banks are but that's it\nAnd that was the first time in twenty five years when I put those banks are my broad list some\nFour or five years ago [noise] other than prefer\nI got to make one quick comment about prefer somebody asked me about this about prefer going down as a good time to buy short is if you're in an income portfolio\nFrom our website the income portfolio yeah it's a good time to um I to some of your prefers but remember why you're doing an income portfolio so what do you care about income what do you try to do get income what are you trying to do supplement your current income\nWhen you're trying to do increase your um a cost of living your your your spending that you had your discretionary income by getting your money to work for you by generating income that you're getting paid out on a regular basis and that income is using to supplement your\nYour all your other income that you received and that's why you're trying to do it so why do you care whether it goes down to twenty two dollars twenty five twenty dollars Eighteen dollars what do you care\nThe idea is forget about the principal keep the income flowing that's all that matters you're doing it for income it's going to come back\nOr it's going to get called are you going to get twenty five dollars a share\nBut please don't get discouraged if you get discouraged you shouldn't be in an income portfolio I've said this a thousand times I'm going to say it again because I keep getting emails about it if you care that much about your value please cell now\nAnd get into growth stocks and stop getting into income stocks because you obviously don't need income you need to grow some more and if you're looking for grows out of your income positions that are on my list your barking up their own tree 'cause it is going to happen\nSo also\nI Would imagine somebody mentioned to me that I have a stock highlighted in blue that is it an income stock but it's also a foundational stock and he asked the question was well it's a foundational stock as if a foundational stock couldn't be an income stock\nSo if you look very closely at those highlighted in blue that are foundational stocks and I I granted I don't blame anybody it's kinda hard to see trying to figure out a better way to do it maybe I'll Try change it at the right or something but I had to find\nThe lettering on that stock is in yellow\nTried to in case indicate that it is a foundational stock maybe I ought to highlight the whole thing and yellow and maybe put the lettering and blew that might be better maybe I should try that\nBut at this point I hate to confuse people but um that's that's okay that's happened to be a growth stock but the income that produces\nIs very good and and I would consider it an income stock but in the same line of thinking you can't be worried about growth you're doing it strictly for income don't be worried about growth if you're doing it for growth and you happen to get that income that's a wonderful thing\nOh let me go to Cathy Cathy calling us from Michigan had Cathy\n[noise] the morning and you hear me yes okay um\nI had a question I have a rough IRA and I'm the one\nAnd I'm Wondering about the allocation I have and that\nBut under that Seventy percent bond ten percent and never meant money market twenty percent so when do you think you're going to use the money\nOh not anytime soon\nI'm Sorry what was that a rat and I still okay [noise]\nUm yeah I mean I think that's fine I mean I I don't um [noise] you know I mean I think that's fine but it's pretty aggressive\nI mean I you know I Would hesitate a little bit but if you're if you're not going to use it I don't know what it what you think uh I mean I'm taking eight years ten years I don't know if that sooner not for you but uh if you're going to be leaving that money for the next eight to ten years then I wouldn't\nBe problem I Would ever too much of a problem with that if you think you're going to need it sooner I probably tear back on that Seventy percent [noise]\nIn the ... [noise] but you know more\nNow hopefully they can come to terms or do something some kind of can be getting a compromise may be making a promise it's not going to be a public promise but maybe make a promise to the United states that are going to revisit this\nIn a year and a half I don't know when there are elections are or over check it out John\nCanada's elections there there are elected prime minister\nCanada's elections\nThere there are elected prime minister when they hit anyway [noise] so maybe they can make some sort of promise they want some relief on steel and aluminum we want some relief on lumber some relief on on a\nDairy\nGet there's plenty to negotiate all\nThey want some relief on this whole idea of arbitration served as Mexico\nWe've got to have that I Believe that rules are important role and we got to have the ability to negotiate or to arbitrary or some violation in some way shape or form without having to renegotiate the entire deal\nI think we've reached compromise on the length of the deal how long this deal is going to last I think we reached some agreement on that\nSo we're making headway\nBut we gotta keep plugging away and we got to hope that we'd come alongside the EU right now I don't understand why we can't make start to make some individual deals right now without making an overriding deal when Europe offered us no tariffs on automobiles either way we should have taken it [noise]\n\nPresident Trump said it's not enough it's OK let's talk about what the left and negotiate that as well\n\nBut he's quick to say it's all just make a separate deal with Mexico how about we just make a separate deal on cars with Europe and make separate deals on steel with Europe and make separate deals on batteries with your makes separate deals on\nOn a windmills with your I mean that's just a if we're going to do that that will take each deals they tell them\n\nWe're not going to get to a place where there's no tariffs on anything for anybody\n\nThat's not going to happen I Can't believe the president's would be naive enough to think that's going to happen I don't think he is I'm sure he's ... he's got enough smart people I Know some of them around them that are going to work on a by that\nI Would think\nEuropean stocks I don't know where they finished the day by European stocks were lower early on in the day China's got major issues right now they're talking about ... they're just one point five points away from being in contraction mode\nIn their in their service sector\n\nThat is a huge problem since they've been working feverishly trying to build their service sector so that they can grow their economy through service sector and not all to manufacture and not be so heavily dependent upon manufacturing exports\nWell guess what is dropping quick why because nobody's got any money\n\nThey're losing their discretionary income as a matter of fact a lot of people in China losing their income altogether we're not hearing about that we can hear about that that that we have no way of hearing about that\nBut we got to know that they're manufacturing a production of slowing down the service sector now slowing down that means people are losing jobs I mean people are starving to death to literally\n[noise] so\n\nThere's gotta be room for negotiation in these areas\nNow we've got worries about emerging markets we see South Africa's economy slipping into a recession kinda snuck up on everybody\n\nWhat's the next we've got to worry about some of the other emerging markets\n\nThen we've got currency issues with emerging markets that we've got to be concerned about\n\n[noise] anyway [noise]\nWe've\nGot to look at what a individual investors what consumers wife was um [noise]\nBusiness
