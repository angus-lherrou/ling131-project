relations is a an area of great interest to me\nAnd in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about vitamin D\nAnd the so called election meddling by Russians um about about one of them are putting them what Vladimir

he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about uh uh someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nThey don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know and what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort an FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually a tax possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances he he specifically said to me no she did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been\nSort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting I have it be that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to design to do what's happening now more of this you know we in so in some ways we shouldn't allow me to write a strange moment and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context is everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything with that timeline\nYou had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the rising again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announced is\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I. N. F. treaty signed by Bob are signed by I'm a ... President Reagan\nAnd negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles\nIn Europe\nThen the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo ... it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir ... wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing earth sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com

is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nNothing for you know the vice president's et cetera uh the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time let me ask you this because getting getting back to this item treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can eliminate us on that\nBut what you know that he's going to target these countries I ain't getting talk so what is it what does that mean and and how ... what is what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pullout\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threatened you know the U.S in countries where we\nMay deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan when the person who choose against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so what do you mean by targeting is is really just putting the coordinate sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time out of that period of\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he what I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all the Ford and this is how bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia can keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can get up and he's trying to Boston and I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThe you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the trading but this is classic Trump negotiations it's you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the underlined or show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy that language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying through the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know what about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell on the important point and and you and I own a gun to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for people to talk to the show dog teams on a show\nSo much but my my question and a lot of people what they don't understand is it is it is is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nThe reestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nAll you're exactly right and things like me\nWell thank you but you got a [laughter] as I Do not see them all show [laughter] playing that a little bit explained to explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah it'll exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you\nReally have the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union pitch to them that destroyed them\nEconomically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this just changing stand some of these are the Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strength it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to doing that right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the most or their their entire administration on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier et cetera I mean there was an intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the man is administrators and against a political candidate and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to I guess\n[noise] taught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work you're doing and I

credit and their light it's tall I close to the election to kind of you know\nYeah I was I I think there's this thing possible that's why this piece this morning and thank you very much ... for the call 'em you know we've got the situation MSNBC has been columns us just in the mail bomb suspect reads the Drudge Report and Fox News you know something about one of the earlier callers which was hinting at\nWhich is sort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back\nSort of these false flag operations I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in what I'm saying is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a a feminist activist in Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened to turned out she was sending threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist a on a college campus uh you know this issue of\nFolks who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic or feeding a only to racist graffiti only to find out that it was in fact done by the people who they claim that we've seen this happen before\n[noise] so that's why I tend to discount these things are let's go to ah let's go to Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the war and grim show\nThank you a question that should be at the one that we heard many times over and over again five weeks ago by liberal under our during the cabin on hearing or not one who benefit from this word for it couldn't believe that a high tech high\nAgain have it so I Would act even though I disagree with that comment it completely let going back to their own ... who benefits from the delivery of the\nPackage or to anti Trump people what course it's the lack of course it is and I agree with the last caller there was never any attempt to hurt anybody it's odd\nQuestion has to be asked\nIf it's a lot and it's a lot in question and ... in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with the ... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times but I Want to make sure that a hammer that point home so do we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form when I had this conversation yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat bizarre ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb there pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefit\nOr real benefit continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut what the Russians are really wants is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\nBecause I didn't want to talk a little bit about the primaries and a couple of folks have asked me to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez odd because it it all fits into what's going on here\nBut we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running\nIn the south Carolina's first congressional district I Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over a fact\nUh how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in these states in a whole host of areas\nAnd so she's going to be joining us we're

Can't imagine that a girl from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\n[noise] it just it because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right you know Democrats don't have a platform\nIs year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the best economy we had in generation no yeah the lowest them wind that amber and\nIf people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric they're all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be\nWe should stand proud and strong to gather as a country\nMy ... my ... South Carolina state representative to the Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody will it's obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news is fake bombs story\nAnd and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an officer we were never going to the GDP above two percent\nOf the Trump a communist turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks are talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets how are they on those sort of the the Trump ... tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly a lot more money in our pockets that Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get taxed to to auto path\nWe need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class get permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into session [noise] but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area\nA bowling being wanted them shore and they just four hundred new people [noise]\nThe parents no one likes a tariff no one likes the tariff\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is dumb the world's best negotiator let demand do his job you don't regulate it get\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd think well I get ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we need government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit for this I'm going to be told that to me that's probably part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problems and Republican believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it\nFinally we've got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep them a mental going it is paramount I was ... like ...\nAs my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocks from their lawns and he's already been a little bit that sort of by one of my other barely works is is the is this issue regulations\nBut but you know and it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I'd formulated a theory on what are called Trump's range of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a for a new thing for a new rules that I was ...\nAnd number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nBut you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will refuse don't pre negotiate with yourself\nI mean this is this is the great folly of a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always pray to go shoot at an eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is not happy about a tariff on mostly aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is and go shooting tested to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're doing through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day it's going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nWe have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it

never going to be our friends that I Need to know that we have a president is going to stand tall against\nThem I just you know I was going to ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this bomb possibly but I really want to focus more on substance here\nI mean what about what is your what is the sort of your opponents response when when he talks about do you mean he literally I'm assuming he's you know for the rest of the Democratic playbook which is to undo all of the great games here\nWhat how does he proposed the housing ... the economy jumpstart it\nUpon it not that smart [laughter] the only thing he's the only thing he runs on as you watch it on and he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he he is\nRunning on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said\nYeah and well number one he doesn't understand the job of Congress that's not their job that the president ... put that aside and then he comes out what he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience well the only thing he has experience in doing is lying to some people about offshore oil\nAnd getting them to endorse him otherwise there's no platform\nHe has nothing I debated him it was it ever get to a point\nIn your your you know in an argument with somebody

the based on some political assumptions\nSo we're gonna have to wait and see\nSo that's that's what's impacting it's not that great now that the the liberal politicians as of this morning\nFrom now until the end of the election are all going to be talking about luck at what President Trump is done because up trade and tariffs because of China us relations with trade there would be wrong\nNow if ... if the first quarter next year they want to say that go for it if we still have not worked at a deal\nThere is a strong possibility no I Would say there is a likelihood that\n... is this is the F F\nDemocrats take control of the house then we've got issues and some problems if that happens now [noise] [noise] right now are you know if you want to be just right down the middle\n\nYou could say there's a fifty percent chance of that happening I mean there's a fifty percent chance that it's not going to happen\nIf we look at past history it's gonna happen if you look at past history of uh the presidential races like the last presidential race that we thought would never happen happened a so could this happen\nThe sense that you know it you're you're on a fixed income you know you have you got a pension you got a four O. one K. you got Social Security or whatever you have there you know what that is\nAnd so it all it all comes to uh you don't want to use some of that income to put aside in in emergency savings you already have that so uh\nI Would say if you have an relatively new home you don't feel like you feel like most of the maintenance or things that can happen you're going to do out of your regular you know just your normal income stream from on a regular basis you don't have any debt\nYou know certainly you want to have a ten thousand dollar you know emergency savings account eight to ten thousand dollars but I Would say as you get closer to that retirement and you're now you're you know two years away from that retirement you want to have that build up a little bit more\n[noise] um yeah no I agree with that [laughter] but it's not that not because I get it from like the working perspective that a long time to go like okay I'm On the art of the you know on right Robert ... six months expenses whatever a year and I just didn't know if\nI guess I heard your last Frank I'm somebody asked about well how much money do you need that would have saved up before you can retire and you had let them know that you should be able to plan out of five or six percent\nReturn so I get as far as like OK shooting for an income strain to be able to let All right but then I was just wondering okay like in addition to that you you you know have\nHow much maybe as the percentage or I guess that there's not that really work but\nLike well I I mean remember ten years ago Fifteen Years ago\nI Would have been worried not not I mean if you worked Fifteen Years younger I'd be worried about I'd ask you things like what kinds of jobs do you have the feel secure in your jobs have seniority\nIf the downturn in the economy would you likely get laid off because you're in the construction industry or would you be fined because you work for the local government\nOr you're a teacher you know so I Would look at those things 'cause they're critically important when you think because if I lose my job do I have enough income to carry me Kerry my expenses\nFor six months so very different situation I'm not as concerned about that for two reasons one is your little closer to retirement\nA you're a little bit older I Hope you have some you know real sense of security on your job and the other thing is we live in an environment right now where\nUm the threat of\nYou know lay offs and losing a job um aren't as\nBig a deal as say they would have been seven or eight years ago [noise] so I think I think the important issue is to take care of those emergency expenses that you don't want to get in debt to fix so well\nI have a credit card if my furnace blows up I use a credit card well yeah but now you got the debt and you gotta ... dead for a lotta years so\nThat's not a good strategy a better strategy is my furnace blows up I've got savings that I can replace it with so for and you know or maybe you have income that you can use you know but so I Would just keep it isolated to those things and everybody is it a little bit of a different situation and that\nThat ... area that's why I hate to say you ought to have five percent of your income for ten percent of your income or you know one third of your annual gross salary you know committed to her um urgency savings because it\nMay not it may not be the case said it all you know so\nI Would just try to work backwards towards some worst case scenarios of what would happen right now and do I have emergency savings to take care of that so I don't have to get in that\nOK okay thank you very much\nAll right Bonnie I'm Glad you called I sure do appreciate thank you for your partnership that's great uh sure appreciate it [noise] let me go to stand San also calling his ... staying also calling us from Ohio a stand\nAlone to an ... good morning here last year saying by speaking the gospel truth for financial aid and I'm In the street\nAnd had a question about my ability to\nSpecific stock or neutral phones in reference or not a teacher and coach and they or their finances are rushing retirement funds and leaving it legacy for the next generation I'm not a licensed broker\nA pastor right right but\nWondering what the building was someone say oh I lost money because of you and you're not a a licensed stockbroker\nAnd you're not a light switch stock sales personally yes why handle financial liability my scenario minister\n[noise] well I don't think you really have a liability their um the liability comes when you're charge you know see\nThat's when you have a liability so if you charge somebody if somebody says you know a pastor I was thinking about investing money can you help me\nAnd you said you know watch for you know I for sixty five dollars an hour you know I'm I'm you know I'd be happy to help you then you got a liability um [noise] so I wouldn't be too concerned about\nLiability but even me one of the things that I Want to do more than anything else and it may be easier in the environment in which you're working for you to do this\nBut my our goal should be you and I stand our goal should be that the people that are in front of us that we want to convict them to bring Jesus into their money\nWe want to convict them that as they would try to walk closer in their day to day world activities with Jesus that they would not separate\nAnd compartmentalize their finances that that that too would be a part of their walk and face\nAnd we want to convict them of that we want to share the versus you know you hear me say that God says\nAh for those who honor me so I see on or not he says that in in first Samuel chapter two at the end of chapter to and you and and that you kind of have to read that whole chapter ... to get a feel for that promise\nNow I don't know I thought what an honor looks like and I don't think we should be promising prosperity but I Do believe we can stay you'll get a sense of peace\nUm uh by knowing that you're not grieving the heart of God with how you're investing your money and it's important that we pray about how we should do that where we should go and some ideas this is you speak you know some ideas would be look from what I understand\nThere are\nThere's really only one mutual fund company that you can diversify your portfolio\nAnd diversification is important so you oughta call this Timothy planned group and talk to them where you can fully diversify your portfolio there are couple other biblical responsible funds you heard me maybe yesterday recommend a a a\nInflation protected bond fund for somebody that was a spit booking responsible demand guard fun typically responsible most\nGovernment bond funds are biblical responsible so there are some other alternatives but you know or use some of the ... you know I I Believe in things if you want to want to do that but you know the ... of the key is your job is to convict them do want to do that\nTo to want to make sure\nThat they're not investing in a company that are supporting abortion and pornography gambling and the redefinition it was funny I I Know what is ... I'm I'm a mutual fund company that holds themselves out as being Bibeau the responsible somebody this morning a friend of mine sent me an article with a picture\nOf this company set up at the uh L. T. G. beach invention\nUm you know I'm a ... ... with the booze try to you know bring 'em the their their marriage or\nTheir same sex marriage into you know their community of investing investment so you know it's and everybody maybe everybody has a different definition of what's going to respond to buy any I only know God's work so\n[noise] um [noise] and what that sounds so I don't think you have any liabilities and I think the best place to stay start with any pastor and I've said this disastrous conferences is with conviction [noise]\n... is as part of that and you you just you know\nA summit the bills to Medicare or the your doctor that through your hassled us but then there's Medicare Advantage which is part of which came up and a two thousand three and this is the HMO or the health plan version of Medicare and what this means as that\nFor the health plan version of Medicare and what this means is that the health plans to help lead by law are\nAllowed to say to deny you access to care now book Medicare's do deny access to care but the health plans to do it sort of at an arm's length distance\nFrom Congress and this was Congress's plan that they would be able to blame the health plans for asking your care once once you got into them so about thirty percent of the Medicare population is in the health plan it limits their access to care by limiting it to a network by limit\nIt to a medically necessary procedures as determined by the health plan um\nBy reducing what they pay to doctors and and the interesting thing is that the U.S department of health and Human Services the office of inspector general came up with a report that said this is so interesting\nThat said that of all the people who choose and that it's both people and practitioners who choose to appeal that denial decisions of health plan Seventy five percent of the time the health plans were versus their decision and move forward to pay for our authorized the care\nBut nobody appeals but only one percent to ... you have a vested died appeals and and why is that because\nIt is so difficult to do it because you know their ration health care can happen in many ways including putting bureaucratic\nI'm I'm barriers between the patient and the and the care or between the doctor and payment for their care and so and so you know this is all medically necessary carrying the federal government is saying there's probably a lot\nMedically necessary care that's being denied by virtue of the fact that most people aren't appealing but when they feel most people actually get the care so this is just the neck and it's I'm correcting can't this is why\nWe tell people to go into original Medicare which which can also Rafik hair is true but at least that's being done in a more accountable manner\nI connected to a Congress and um and it's not the health plan making a little like a bulldozer money off of you and the taxpayer and I think that's just one thing I should add as well so people understand these health plan\nThese plants are not insurance and they're not private market if this public private partnership between the government and these um\nPlan which are really centralized corporate entities that are acting like socialized medicine but corporate fashion and I'm here's here's what's so interesting about the money that they're making\nSo somebody you probably have money in and and um you know what ... plans and stocks right but but look at this um they are planning for there to be\nNot just Medicare for all the investors in this world think it won't be just a single payer system they're not worried because they're thinking it won't be Medicare for all it will be Medicare Advantage for all you can other words it will be HMO run in this country single care will be HMO health plan\nRun in this country and right now the health plans are making like bandits I'm One that does Medicaid only has had a rise in stock prices by four thousand percent since two thousand nine\nUnited Health group has gone up fourteen hundred percent\nAnd so they're just refinance money hand over fist all because of the Affordable CARE Act and because of Medicare Advantage\nNot that you are getting subsidized from the government has to be in the Affordable CARE Act\nWhich absolutely crushed in many ways different ways of subsidizing them\nYou know it's just amazing and so if you weren't in this open enrollment period now folks for for Medicare\nYou really need to examine all of a but stick to the original ... Medicare if you can do that and um maybe you use Samaritan ministries or\nAs a as yours supplement\nAnd also just like you say for those who have bought the book there isn't a separate chapter in there about a Medicare Advantage and the accountable care organizations that people in the original Medicare or being forced into in secret\n... if you if you look at the ... votes to be a scale section and see what Medicare is doing\nGreat [noise] taught about his great a gross stuff we sure appreciated as always [noise] while I was the best [noise] nobody knows more about this that's why\nShe's here every month she comes here once a month to help all of us understand the things that are the to the show or it's usually they're not when she finished with Nike drunk on a God Bless [noise]\nHard worker or ... you were saying earlier about your younger workers to get involved with ... and early ... things I Do too much I'm thirty seven now and in the past seven eight years after listening to the guards and your lover you're now Harvard able to go to worry about a hundred thousand\nMorning after more than I Am a partner and wants to help with their minute three miles is all went under was going to be our eyes and ears of mine and I just pray to God that the money to come in for news stations because we need them\nTo sort of you're not going to financial issues daughter were in a regular basis I got a reason why you need to go at least now ... or Christian Community credit union a Christian biblical you responsible wedding\nLoan rate mortgage rates raised the the way we're ... community credit you go to our nature wishes dot org and\nWent on to see see the new finer stories from a liberal perspective [noise]\nReborn dot org is one of the greatest ministries I Believe that is saving the lives of the\nYoung one would you go to Don we're right now that are hundred and forty dollars will allow five young mothers weren't really changing their mind to choose a life\nJohn reborn dogs [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi this is the issue here from financial I Hope\nTo you consider partnering with tuition is one of the things that you're going to get from that access to or by the access to our so you're going to become educated about the economy\nAnd the testimony from people just like you I Hope you are going to financial issues dot or in a ring which is that by nature will issues dot org\nYou're listening to the best oh financial issue which brushed bought mortgages earlier this week [noise]\nAre lifted back to a Facebook let me go to Sandy Sandy is saying instead of moving an IRA can I start a second\nTDY or mirror trade a killer I guess is what you're saying [noise] understand and I can only contribute to want to year\nThat's growing city by the way you can contribute to as many as you want but you only have a maximum amount per year that you can contribute total so if your\nYou hear that you can contribute total\nSo if you're under fifty Sandy you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars and if you want to split that between two you can do that\nIf you're over fifty you can contribute sixty five hundred thousand dollars more so if you're over fifty can contribute sixty five hundred a year and it doesn't matter where you put it\nOr you could put it in two different accounts but you you you're maxed out at sixty five hundred\nCases asking about Timothy funds to Timothy fun checked him out [noise]\nUm the funds have um a fees they have some have up front sales charges yes some have see shares\nSell them or institutional shares which you can buy through your brokerage that or institutional that don't have any fees\nAnd they have internal fees as all funds do but Keith are saying they seem to be higher\nCan you give me your thoughts so here's my thoughts are the facts about that a kid [noise] people are so you have to understand the fun and this isn't one of your concerns but I'll say it anyway so fund managers\nHave they don't want to nobody wants to sell Timothy um\nTry to get a fund manager to sell in Israel fund oh my gosh Israel though you know there are occupiers of the Palestinian nation why would you want to support I'm just telling you I mean you get ... you hear everything but\nYou\nDid the ... when you look at ratio when you look at fees you've got a look at ratio ... so if you looked up you chew off on", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "26"}
