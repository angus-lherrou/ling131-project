A. N. F. A. J. it rose eight one hundred several point to four point for two percent and a five year adjustable rate mortgage it's still a great deal if you only plan on being in your home five years or less it rose for one hundred separate percent\nTo four point one four percent\nYou know it's interesting you said it's still a great deal they're all great deals they are you're right because I remember and I've told people this before but ... ... ... last year\nRemember and I've told people this before but ... ... ... last year they were the lowest almost in history yes so there are only a point higher there still fantastic rates I Want to\nSay when I got in business Twenty years ago Nineteen Ninety eight I think the rates were about eight percent\nAnd people were buying a house or excited than that it was under the double digits so there you go yeah but then you know we watched it go down and down and down and then it was held down for so long and of course that's what started the frenzy\nSo it's they're still great they are great you know I look at it that way five percent is is wonderful that they are going up so if you're a buyer and you're sitting on the fence and you can't decide whether now it's a good time or not now is a good time because the rates are going up\nSo you're going to be able to afford the last house every time the rate goes up yeah that's the truth now want to hear an interesting\nStory and told us when to my son in law last night told them we were talking about this on the radio he couldn't believe it I I entitled is one a buyers and selling realtors nightmare so Angela and I haven't told you this one yet so imagine how difficult it is to sell a ten million dollar\nProperty it's hard right\n[laughter] it's very hard there's very few buyer few buyers now how about a fifty million dollar house fellow even less fires Howard now we're talking about\nBy the way a property in Manhattan so I kinda figured that enough because they needed million there aren't many fifty million dollar property here in fact there probably zero there's none here there's no so um and there's an offer\nThis is a true story a quarter an hour into Manhattan hello there's an offer on this fifty million dollar property now I presented one problem wait a minute you know presented\nTo the seller now the cellar on most homes is usually a husband and wife and sometimes the husband and wife agree on the terms and the price sometimes that they disagree now this time\nIt's a little bit harder why because the seller is not a person yeah the seller is actually a country\nWhy now think about this how quickly can you get someone in a country\nTo agree on the price [noise] now how what country are you talking about it and wait a minute is I don't understand who do you get approval from do you have to go to the president of that country do you go to the dictator do you go to the parliament I mean who do you do to\nGet depends what country it is what country is it Yugoslavia you could fly is not a country\nThat's right back in the Nineteen nineties Yugoslavia got broken up into five that's right trees Bosnia Croatia\nMacedonia Serbia and Slovenia yes so now instead of one country agreeing on the price this property in New York\nIs owned by five countries and by the way these five countries they don't get along\nYeah that was said you know they don't get along so imagine they they agreed that the property should be sold in fact they agreed years ago that it should be sold\nIt's currently occupied it rented to a a ... to one of the countries who is renting it for something I don't remember but anyway they got an offer\nThey can't agree 'cause they don't agree on anything the buyer this was last year the buyer walked away\nAnd bought another property three blocks away for forty five million dollars\nAnd mass them now are go now it got put back on the market this week\nOkay ah\nI Want to now how did they agree on who the real terror would be I don't know at least ... agree on that that is really funny but it's you know why I think that person is probably stumping that sale it's\nThe one who is renting their property they probably don't want to move I don't know what you\nWant to move out of fifty million dollar property I wouldn't if I was able to rent\nIt I don't know I Would not blame a it's obviously a gorgeous gorgeous place and it is I saw pictures of it you know this being sold furnished the least agreed years ago to sell it\nAnd I guess each of the companies could use an influx of\nYou know a tenth of the fifty million dollars asking price ten and twenty I'm Sorry yes the twentieth a fifth of it\nYeah but they couldn't agree on the terms so the other by or walk and again in these countries who do you go to to agree on the selling price in one of ... going to say well you know I'm mad at this other country [noise]\nWell that's why I'm saying they want ... at the one that really upsetting the apple cart and who ... who do you get to sign the papers now they've already picked that they already know it's going to sign [noise]\n... what if the administration changes in that particular country\n... turning out there that's got the right to sign\nHigh on the kind of nice to have really really interesting started\nNot pulling the strings on decision making but they have the right thing [noise]\nI don't know it's going to be a real headache for the realtor but if they pull it off it's a good pay day for the realtor\nI Would love to be that realtor within fifty million dollar property that something will never happen in our lifetime\nI don't know well it won't happen here that's when I and you know are mean\nAnyway when we come back after the break we're going to talk about for sale by owners will stay with us every one we're also going to answer your questions we'll be right back [noise]\nThe first layer of information which as photos right so when you're marketing at home the photos have to look fantastic they can't be off your cell phone\nYou can't be a free cell by owner and take pictures with your cell phone because you think you're good at it are all your little kid pitchers turnout great so you think you're an awesome photographer that won't do justice to your home when you're in competition with\nHomes in the marketplace that had been taken you know with photographs have been taken by a professional photographer right so you know in our um\nOur a secret sauce I guess you could call it we understand photos are the most important and it's not just you know it's like any other business\nPhotographers are not all created equal there's some that are better than others so it's really worth paying for the good ones I'm also when we do marketing you know we start on the MLS so to for sale by owners\nBut we paid to push that\nOut Watson pace in our case you know to go out to more than two hundred and twenty five Web sites\nFor sale by owner they're not even going to know how to do that right that it's not going to be at their fingertips they're not going to have that knowledge um\nAdditionally they might hold an open house because you know how else would you get people to come\nBut the question is do they know the safety and how to protect themselves and protect their valuables right there's so many different things so marketing is you know we pay for to do at digital campaign right so it goes on Facebook\nAnd it's it goes Fifteen miles around where the property is and when somebody\nClicks on that house than we pay to have it re targeted so it follows that person around for two weeks on your computer here is the first sale by on are going to know how to do that I think not yeah I really think not\nLet's go back to the pictures for a second 'cause of the guys who is really interesting you may think talking so much about pictures because the border of pictures is so important it is so I'm going to give a secret\nTo everyone just so they\nKnow we keep giving our secret sauce that way that could hurt or business people don't know and there are there are so many little tricks like\nThis gay but there are some websites that only show for pictures so if you don't put the right for pictures\nAs the first four yes then you're missing it you may think oh I'm going to show the for outside great pictures well if you're not showing your kitchen in your bathroom and your bedroom which may be the best features of your house they're not getting out there 'cause what sells houses Howard bathrooms\nKitchens bedrooms so\nBack on the kitchen yeah [laughter] that's the way of ALS houses so yes you have to have those in the order of things are important absolutely\nThan we know how to get it read shown on Zillow as a new showing\nYes so they're not going to tell everyone that's right because there are even some realtors that don't know how to do [laughter] can't throw it maybe with the bathwater but we know how to do that so there's so many things other than pictures and we do postcards and we do so now than\nWe send out postcards saying that the houses just listed so that uh you know what that within a two mile radius 'cause there'll be people who are looking for a move up neighborhood\nAnd you know they they will know that your houses on the market to maybe they're not on the Internet or whatever but they'll they'll see it from these postcards that we send we also make marketing flyers to put out in the front yard so people can pick up we also pay for digital campaign\nThat the texting number [noise]\nOr we don't have time to do this whole segment\n[laughter] we pay for it by a a anyway I did\nThe music looming I got to pick up on the next time\nDistracted there's liability issues with the paperwork there are so many scams are bound and we can\nTalk about it when we come back don't rush to this says it's important what the next segment is the fourth we can do that open houses and then talk about it All right well we got lots more things to talk about [laughter]\nAnd most importantly is still sell for more money [noise]\nSay money less money going to talk about\nWhen we come back\nAfter the break and if you got a couple of questions we're going to answer them to to to to eight to five five you're going to answer the questions right Angela oh yeah and if you don't

reason for\nWhat happened is explainable only by that old saying that sometimes all news is good news sometimes all news is bad news and other times all news is just news this week seemed to be mostly on the bad news\nIt was just news this week seemed to be mostly on the bad news and statistically I'll tell you over the time\nThe the month following a bad October is generally not real good not real bad generally just a little negative after which time everything tells us that it will take off and we'll go through a period of time is really extraordinary\nCan't say that will happen but I'm telling you what's happened over time and our trivia question which will give you after the first break reflects some of that if not all of it but anyway I going to let Adam take the ugly part this week that was good news though we had a Thursday\nUp there I gave all the good news you can talk about the rest yeah\nYeah it wasn't real pretty it was um markets all fell more than three percent the month of October has been downright ugly for us equities\nOr goals yep that's true and and that has been the challenge recently much like in the housing market where the month supply was so low there just wasn't any inventory to buy and people were pointing to that as a bad number but that's not a bad number that means demand is through the roof and there isn't enough\nSupply to go around so I that's why the prices have been going up and we've had devastating\nStorms a couple of times just recently to that has come by some economic activity it'll spite that we have come across a lot of that came after this number but the three and a half percent GDP number was very solid\nAnd as areas like the panhandle and the Carolinas are making their comeback\nYou're going to see a flurry of activity over there which is all going to add on to the GDP so I think we're going to close out the year with a very very solid performance and GDP yeah and that helps him on that\nYet and we're willing to earning season as well and it seems like we have a little bit of a problem here with top line growth the earnings beat rate stands at sixty seven point too which is strong in line with the previous quarters\nBut the revenue rate had dropped fifty six percent well below about the Seventy percent rate we have seen for the last three quarters and whether that's expectations have gotten out of control or companies are slipping a little bit and their their top line growth rate both are possibilities it's probably a combination somewhere in between\nThe it's a little bit lower as it stands so far so that's something to keep an eye on and that's the problem that we had had throughout the recovery uh so earnings were growing like crazy and revenues were just not growing for the longest time so hopefully we're not going back to that 'cause that would be that would not be a great sign\nYou know we need more consumers yet which are made from people with jobs and as you know they're seven million jobs openings job openings in this country not enough people to fill them the more people that we can get working a lot of people have been out of the labor market so long they really don't\nHave much clue about how to get back in when truly it's pretty easy nowadays\nYeah uh I mean as far as if there's been a time in my lifetime that it's been easier to find a job I'm not talking about your dream job but a job I don't remember when it was because their jobs are plentiful right now\nI saw Rachel Campos Duffy this morning and she was talking about having just been back to Wisconsin which of course brings kind of hold me with us having been born and raised up there\nAnd she was talking about all the manufacturing this going on and it's like the old days when you'd walk up and down the streets of the where the factories are and so on and everyone has a help wanted sign on and and the all you have to do is walk in and they're going to figure out something that you can do if you're serious about getting the job is is that good up there\nThat's good to hear and the other good news out of earnings season is that more companies are raising guidance than lowering the number slightly lower than has been in the past few quarters but it's still positive so that means that companies are still optimistic about the coming quarters which is that is great news\nYeah I Want it you know how I rail about they they that's in quotation marks who are those guys the economists you know the same ones are predicted date out of the last three recessions\nThe numbers they're putting out now are very difficult to match and expectations so what'd you come up with as a lot of misses the economic data for this week was twenty two two Fifteen of which were negative seven positive and if you look at the numbers column the actual readings on all of this stuff they're beautiful\nBut if you look at the expectation numbers they're higher than those and\nYou don't look at what point do you say something's really good or just good or bad\nMissing expectations if those expectations are unrealistic is not something I pay a great deal of attention to is the economy good yes it is it has been good for some time it will be good for some time to come\nMarkets react to a lot of things in the short run that's the noise somewhere in the noisy period right now but markets long run are driven by economic conditions and ours are excellent\nYeah that was one thing I wanted to talk about too is that um you're carrying a lot of the the talking heads they have we reached peak earnings no meaning that they can only go down from here and I agree it's absolute\nI Would reach peak earnings no meaning that they can only go down from here and I agree it's absolutely remember peak oil that was in the seventies ridiculous I Know that and the answer is they don't we have no idea what's going to happen with earnings going forward but if market conditions they like they are they should continue to improve so\nI I just don't see where they where they're coming up with this this is not as good as it gets and this is that we're never going to get any better anyone who says that hasn't lived long enough\nWhich leads me into some headlines there's ... F get tongue tied and flabbergasted sometimes when I read news in the headlines often those are different things not always so I've got a couple of ... this week\nOn Tuesday Chinese you on their currency to replace US dollar\nBy end of twenty eight team\nNow that means they have two months and four days to replace the u._s. dollar\n... down at the Breton woods conference took place how many decades ago where we declared the u._s. dollar the reserve currency ... I didn't hear of another Britain was being called for November did you know and\nWho sponsored this rather unusual headline Hartford villain the blank group what do you suppose that word might be well four letters long oh starts with G\nGoals oh are we what happened and inking annuities but okay what happens\nIf the dollar gets replaced by another currency\nDemand for dollars falls what happens when demand for anything false price goes down how was gold purchased it is purchased in dollars that means if the dollar goes down the price of gold is going to react is going to take more and more dollars to buy it they're selling gold oh who would've thought\nRight and who is another goody these\nFive charts prove that the stock market is on the cusp of crashing by Seventy percent may be more that was Thursday so on the cusp know how big it costs you suppose it is I don't know\nSeventy percent or more really\nLets see remember oh six seven eight everybody\nSeven eight nine actually yeah should I say it on the S P lost about fifty five percent total so this is going to be bigger than that when that was only matched once in history by the crash of twenty nine\nI'm really and\nBy the way those charts prove it says right there prove so\nI'm I read it all and I didn't see any proof of anything ignore that stuff this one has a website called money and markets which is an aggregator website they bring in stores from all over so I Can't say that they're responsible for it they didn't bring it down and posted and then friday\nMedia on alert recession worse than the great depression coming in twenty twenty of that is irresponsible journalism people what set up the crash of twenty nine the things that set up the crash of seven eight nine they do not exist today\nAnd you could invent a scenario but it is completely irresponsible to publish anything like this\nAlso friday we think the major economies are on the cusp of this turning into the worst recession we've seen in ten years now think about this what's wrong with that story and by the way I'm going to tell you your mother got it instantly ... she nailed this one okay\nWe haven't had one in ten years [laughter]\nSo we're going to enter the worst recession in ten years it would also be the only one well then by definition that is correct that loved that\nThe next recession could put the two thousand a financial crash the shame\nCould being the operative word two thirds of business economists than the U. S. expect a recession to begin by the end of twenty twenty a forecast of weather is not good after three days a forecast of economic thinking is not good after about twenty minutes\nOf this stuff you'll hear it [noise] but\nYou won't hear here except as we sit here and make fun of hey no attention to the man behind the curtain things are fine look at the real numbers look at all the people you know that are working to look at how your markets done with their minds but the question is still open what's the what's the value of a few years\nAfter the break we go into some more things that an indifferent\nJust got a whole bunch of great stuff to talk about today\n[noise] one of them is [noise]\nIncome planning [noise] what's that mean to you especially as you get a little older\nThan required minimum distribution reform which is part of that is trying to reform the way we are I'm days they have a great opportunity to get it right here very much so that they will say said opportunity to get it wrong we'll talk about that [laughter] it was the right after the break this is a man was a natural [noise]\nI forgot the best part this lady that I did have tried to obtain a seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar line of credit\nBy making false statements to the bank changed her best friend account against or yeah which was according to her with for a million dollars in reality once the documents came a available in court her net portfolio value was thirty five dollars [laughter]\nNo I haven't [laughter] yeah you know at a laugh but you really shouldn't be crying because those were real people's money that she absolutely and they believed to her well for them you see 'em on TV and you read a bottom the\nPictures on the financial advisor magazine everything's great right yeah very about our own people but you\nThat's not good enough people in I don't think anybody out and do business with us just 'cause we're on the radio but you ought to come see us just because of that goes by the time to get there you're going to understand the things we dislike him to all the things we tell you to do we do so if if you want to sit down and give us a call at the office and\nAdam will give you a run down on that before the show's over on the various and sundry ways to get a hold of us\nBut now I I Want to make very clear that I Am not picking on the website money and markets today as I said they're an aggregator I Do not know where this one comes from but this one is so egregious I Can't help but talk about it\nReport more than half of Americans collect more on welfare than they pay in taxes\nThat what is the possible outcome of that first I just think about it for a moment half collect more welfare than they pay in taxes does that seem right to you folks\nThat I don't that doesn't make a lot of ... no it does not make a lot of sense and here's why a recent report by the ... Institute for those of you don't know ... this was a very famous economist and one of the good ones\nSays more than half of Americans get more money in welfare through things like Medicare Medicaid food stamps and Social Security [laughter] then they pay in taxes each year wait a second is Social Security welfare\nNo and neither is Medicare\nNo what do you have to do to collect\nMedicare and Social Security that you have to you have to be old\nAnd you have to have work then you have to have paid into the system not just a little bit either you have to have ten\nOr forty quarters which ten years of earnings covered in the system in order to even walk into the office and begin to discuss getting that it is an entitlement it is not welfare and now everybody's going to sit back and say that's not an entitlement let me do you find that for you\nThe warden title ... means just this something to which you are in titled\nIt can be entitled by virtue of the fact that you paid your premiums therefore you are entitled to the benefits and that's all it means\nTechnically Social Security and Medicare are entitlements we don't normally say that because the politicians have ruined the word as they have ruined so many other words that they no longer mean what they are\nThey're not exactly trans a transfer payments government transfer payments either end that they're not\nIn theory they're not collective from one person and paid to another but in actuality they are because Social Security is a pay as you go system So Adam pays in every month and I take it out every month it transferred from him to me but I take it out against my account\nThat's not the same thing as him giving me money or the government giving me money is a columnist building even though they're using the money his account is accumulating filled let's get this real clear\nMedicare and Social Security are not welfare people this is absolutely nuts\nThey now they break it down into brackets than the brackets\nAre reasonably meaningless to because they're not counting the right thing [noise] but they do very well demonstrate how the people who pay and the most don't get anywhere near follow but out from the government overtime in any form\nWhat that's not exactly news to anybody we all know\nThat a lot of people getting more and government benefits than they put into it and that's why we have welfare systems that's why we have safety nets for some people\nBut when you see things like this it just reeks of bad politics and people trying to say something that is not exactly who by bending some rules and facts\nAlong the way and when they do it and when I see it I promise you I'm going to call 'em on it because this is not [noise]\nWe'll be back one more segment right after the

doggone it the stock market did its best isn't it I have an absolutely huge show for you today you're going to want to hear every single minute of it\nIt all starts right now I I think it's best\nTo start to show out maybe by sharing with you a few comments that I sent out to our clients this Wednesday remember Wednesday that was a really bad day\nSent it out Wednesday evening after that really horrible what six hundred dish point drop in the evening by our amazing Gemini private client portal involved\nSent it out there is no to our clients Wednesday evening after the great stock market up that's what it was a few cup which few all over the all over the wall street New York stock exchange for a few people can upgrade stocks\nBefore I tell you though exactly what I told our clients let me ask you a question\nLet me ask you a question be honest with me but I already know the answer soon assumed that when I ask a question I already know the answer what does your advisor tell you to do with your money this week how did they advise you about the stock market puke up\nYou should never conduct business in a restaurant because number one I'll take every advantage I can of view and so I'm listening to these Democrats in the booth behind me to Jay's talking to their whack job advisor who I got her business card I don't even though she's actually license to do business\nBut when you when you when you drag this much politics into your investment career and your investment business this may be a little over the edge but this was\nOne whacked out group of people I digress maybe I've gone too far may continue with a script for all run out of time I'm certain\nI told you I wrote to our clients that we had ... about us steel so many times in the past hundred years and every\nTime we bailed out US Steel all US Steel did was raise their prices I told you in February I was I Would support subsidizing US Steel have US Steel would agree not to raise prices on their steel to American manufacturers\nAnd those were the only condition as I was subsidize that company is actively that would have met with amounted to have now having nationalized US Steel\nBut what is the\nPoint of protecting US Steel a new car and chaos and all the red steel dynamics what is the point of that if all they're going to do is crammed price increases down the throats of Harley Davidson of caterpillar see all the great stars anybody to use the steel and America\nIs a point of that Mr President because maybe I'm not as smart as you maybe my hands are not as big\n\nI'm pretty certain I'm smarter than Peter Navarro I got rocks in my garden that are smarter than Peter Navarro union\nDoug I\nTold you about this\nBut the union union lobbyist Navarro\nWhen he leaves this White House and maybe it's only what Thirteen more days six more days seven nine more days how many how much longer do you stay with the administration wants to pandering once the red meat pandering to the base has affected it's it's it is intended purpose which is to\nGet you to vote for Republicans how much longer Donald Trump actually going to keep the moron around how much longer is he going to want to stay\nBecause what should happen as we should be making a deal with China like I don't know six and a half seconds after the president wins this election and there should be no used to have an an an idiot\nLike Peter Navarro anywhere around the president's Secret Service should hold him out telling Peter your your ear stupidity it's contagious it's monumental that's catastrophic\nYes\nMiddle that's catastrophic especially this pain in America you're trying to national security\nThreat to the economy you're conspiring with a shotgun to crush the American stock market\nBut maybe I'm wrong what is your advisor tell you\nRemember what I've been telling you week after week after week after week now and I tell you the story for a reason it's usually everything I say is either I don't know to make a point or to make a show more entertaining but in this case it's because it's a really smart thing and I really really want you to hear it the cure for high\nOil prices the saying always used to be was high oil prices right you get\nOil down at a sixty dollars a barrel and it goes to a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel like they did in two thousand and seven and a hundred and forty like it did in two thousand see I've been around long enough to remember these things and you guys have not\nWhen oil gets up to a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you know what happens to those guys driving those sixty five Seventy five Seventy thousand dollar ... and ... they start selling them\nBecause it's going to cost about a hundred and forty dollars to fill the damn thing up and I don't know who you are but you know even though you can finance that trucker lease that truck for next to nothing when it really comes time to start dumping in a hundred and twenty five hundred and forty dollars worth of gas and you see how fast the mom is try to get rid of those toys\nAnd that's what's gonna happen again [noise] so what happens is that oil prices go up the\nMommy's are going to say well I Can't afford to fill up the escalator sweetheart you're going to have to walk a little but the school it's only three blocks away anyway you're going to have to walk to school\nAnd the demand for oil comes down and and the price of oil calms down so as you destroy the demand you lower the price of oil and we're seeing that we're seeing oil price so so I'm listening to this last job make\nBelieve financial advisor to join us more about that kind of sad sounds buying up all the oil in the world girls a whack I don't know who would listen to this ... donkey was story okay what oh oil prices are doing is getting ready to\nGo back down to its not opinion is just the fact is just the fact jak because what's happened is that it's not\nPrices have gotten to a point that your do your destroying demand\nAnd that's what's gonna happen for China to cure for the trade war is the trade war do you hear upset I Am with this trade war do you have any idea\nHow many billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage or done to the stock market this week\nAs a result of this to pets trade war which is not really a trade war at\nAll\nIt's not a trade war is a plot by Peter no more oh to drag that base out to get you guys all and said hey John and we're going to kill China go jaguars don't don't patriots no my team do you don't do your team only our teams good\nOh they're trying to do it drag your butts out to the vote next week good go vote\n\nI have more on China's coming up if you think you're going to push China around to make sure that you understand something America before you send me or hate mail and you send your emails\nYou know nothing about China\nYou know nothing because America doesn't read number one and what you do read the local newspapers that's all the same stuff from the Associated Press and the rest of the of the rest of the wire services\nAmerica I got people to go to China and come back and tell me what's going on in China I see things that you'd I read papers foreign papers or you don't even know exist\nUntil you something America you know nothing about China you know nothing about who the economic superpower in this world really is at best that's a draw at\nBest it's a draw the longer and more painful this trade more gets the more likely we are to make a deal because the cure for the China trade or is the prolonging other China's trade war\nBoth sides both sides are feeling the pain one side doesn't have to worry about it because he's a left it for a life and he's a communist they don't care what people think they print money like we do they manipulate currencies\nThey don't care about the other guy the other guy is limited and restrained by the fact that I don't know presently he's only here for two more years and if he loses elections next week I pretty much going to be a lame duck after that [noise] so once I have unlimited power\nAnd the other side is trying to find a trade war while his own Federal Reserve chairman is trying to crushing\n\nOne sides fighting with all the weaponry they got the other guys fighting with two hands tied behind his back and Peter Navarro for consumers really are a\n\nI don't know maybe I'm wrong\nSo this is the cure for these high steel prices what we're learning that were caused by this twenty five percent tariff that the idiot Peter Navarro who is a union lobbyist for the steel industry was then we'll be again and we'll have more money and more kickbacks from the unions and steel industries when he gets out in a few weeks\nWhat's happened is a ... ... the cure for these high steel prices\nThe caterpillar is telling you we can't sell bulldozer so no science we don't need any more steel and Harley Davidson say no thanks we can't sell motorcycles so no thanks we don't need no more steel\nAnd whirl pools had to raise their prices on washing machines and dishwashers which is mainly steel and plastic twice and now consumer demand they're telling using the toilet\nAnd those tanks we don't need any more steel\nAnd electro ... the big European appliance manufacturers said the same thing this Friday morning no thanks we don't need no more stinking steal you have managed to destroy our business you\nManage to crush demand for caterpillar bulldozer for fast so now I'm nuts bolts screws for Harley Davidson's for world washing machine from may to watch you managed to destroy it you've managed to destroy the man for our products\nAnd their sits US Steel and robe and the\nSenate but didn't make a deal with Mexico to make sure they have some border control stick keep illegals the hell out of our country so I don't know how to build an eleven billion dollar wall and never going to ever get built\nSo what I'm saying to you as I Would have rallied a team around me\nBecause that's what president G and China did a year and a half a rally attain even here on his team or he has you shocked\nBut our president wants to go on to battle with China if that's what you believe he's doing with two hands tied behind his back am am theater Navarro for a ... right\nNow to Peter Navarro is not a wartime considerably or I don't think
