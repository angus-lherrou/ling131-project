entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and\nDedicated to the constitution and the public good as a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed\nA terrific column by Kevin I think it's it it was both well timed and important to do this or let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina a wait and see we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five Rob welcome\nI Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now to what I wanted to say is it you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republican outta fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think it's true or seeing the results that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was\nI think he was getting real hot okay and I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference when the president\nCame out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh and\nWith whether what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone\nHe kept moving forward he didn't look back he's not going to move and dwell over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments are all we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new

pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\n... also a crime yes altering a\nLot of that can be looked at it after this who ... who leaked Ford's identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended ... a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said\nShe can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed to cleave late and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote\nDecided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as adjusted to the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks dry ... drumming them out of restaurants\nPublishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's crazy\nYou know do you think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours or that he taught\nUp a really needed lost some much needed lots of the Republicans on how to fight for what you believe in a fight for principle fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator [noise]\nThe the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour free themself for America and\nHe he's not ... they called him a bully killing you know I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's talk of the Republican block throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's selling things to the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they used to come he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they owned ever to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one's gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreating back down when he believes in a principal or a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside\nThe contours of the constitution the law there is no such are no doubt on about about they're talking about a passage from your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions\nThe answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck to haul around all this stuff he's produced and you need it posted to talk about a passage in your book\nSo this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary with constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed if you're not believe then you're anti warmer or you're anti victim\nAnd jumped the promise of talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying ourselves as victims of this or victims about because I mean that's not going to help you advance as a person of being able to overcome\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and that everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of sexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their while they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even gave the decency of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh\nAnd his shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein you know exactly where and today it was Harvey Weinstein major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture of Brett Kavanaugh if you're going to find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lotta a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't really learn to women describing kind of not something thirty six years ago\nYou said in criminal charges and done that aren't women describe and kind of not sending thirty six years ... years ago and strong corroborated\nAll right this was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a fabric egg let's listen to make a\nWhy can't you be the ag Kellyanne the fabric of egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of their mouth they say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding a compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice smells shouldn't hold on I'm not done all I Know your value located you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator other president\nYour reaction to that who\nI have to reaction to that not I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant Kevin how ... how high the stakes are Laura odd to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be believed 'em and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be on basically a relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way of his training on social media I Love I Love informing generations that\nI have a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that I was talking about the process\nThey if you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how\nRight well we have a right where it was a comedy I write of course I was\nTalking to I was talking to NBC reporters two of them are shouting at me\nAnd I looked at the one the male reporter uh Pete Alexander and I said to you after operation you know where she you know how she got there and you know she got home do you have you found anybody and he's you know swallowing hard and then ask that question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like a fabric ... meaning the process\nSheet you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and that decency you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nAnd then you might tell us and you have to explain you are and you wonder if there are at by the way and I wasn't\nYesterday I wasn't yesterday but I'm not going to be bullied articulated by particularly by that person\nYou know but the funny thing is killing and I'm just I I just to this stuff up for people because otherwise I just want to\nRepeat it because then it was just a very funny day I\nKnow but it's funny you know the funny thing is that you got to log

blame 'em by ... to my mind\nWhat's happened here in part and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh ... my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nI'm told a line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you that if you try to crash your party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that\nIs to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled it or have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us they won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nWell and I I really mean that is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president and the campaign but coming from ... a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump sought the Republican how to fight\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination it well I think\nHe's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have won at all along and look at this sometimes the ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants yeah\n[noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this ... you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with what these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like sign sign so she's a liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know\nA couple of years where she's been especially the last year where she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge and the and the California has become more and more or less to go on more or less and less left the country almost [noise] well now I'm ... now a new person\nYou probably know this better than I Do but didn't California instituted some system\nHold on we just have breaking news Lisa Murkowski is voting no\nThe Kavanaugh cloture vote so that means you know for the confirmation so that's one person or the Republicans have already lost a and Collins could be a yes but Murkowski is uh no I'm flake as a yes on the cloture vote a so that's a\nI don't know anything you want to say about that Andy before we\nGo forward as you I think pointed out the cloture vote just means we're going forward I'm ... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people\nThought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday a business and there's been so many twists and turns to this and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare ready for her [laughter] frame and keep paying that Andy that's on line and it just I mean there are some childcare and that long way flight out of Indiana are you going to need it yeah yeah Notre Dame the\nDouble time childcare right she's like she said but my mom at six she's got even more than that I\nThink I've got seven you don't use them anything by the way but you know we'll we'll be back in back right now the I'm\nGoing to ask an unpleasant question what is this nomination goes down this weekend what would you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination of someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on Kavanaugh and ride it all the way to the midterms\nRight I I I Would have to ask a\nSorry again I'm Sorry and he held that thought Joe Manchin just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe Manchin the easiest Santa Cruz over unless they both just go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there is not then I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you know if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in\nThe Senate or then we're going to nominate cat and a cabin all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nTo let us more is giving you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you go to Andy ... is a legal yeah but you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want to do and actually be a good one Andy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced their mama carousel law passed\nIn twenty twelve Romney kind of just drop dead after he did a soap box a thing on the at the hardware store like one of his eye sockets they just drive up shouldn't take it out across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care and that would have been a great issue for him and end up but this is this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clint Eastwood in say a man's gotta know limitations [noise] um [laughter] I don't know that I'm the political guy or gal\nThat's all right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it's like Murkowski is a no let's just I don't say that my ... this is why the whole\nYou know let's just do it in the ... that's why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your brother was a ... suddenly you're ... you should be in the Senate I never liked this whole dynastic approach to\nIt you know to the Senate and the house of representatives I I I remember her father I mean and then she's mine she becomes a big liberal so I don't get\nThat at all I never I never understood that but you know patently the indigenous people in Alaska are therefore Murkowski because she does throws a lot of money they're way so they're they're all there for this or any McCarthy thank you so much for having on TV I'm very thin and you're one of my favorite favorite go to gas and thinkers on all these issues will take a break\nA five five forty Laura boy were biting our nails hair this cloture vote it

twenty nine dollars um they may not be a lot of money\nBut um and then I'm there will be another email that'll come they ask you for another fee to something came up in this uh it's all scam just stay
