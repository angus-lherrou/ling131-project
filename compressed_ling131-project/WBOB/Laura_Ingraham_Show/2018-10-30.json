that is fair and do you want to clarify what nationalism means to me\nI don't have to clarify ms I Love the country it means I'm fighting for the country I look at it was his loyalists national is um somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know the weather than anybody else our leaders have been more worried about the world and they have about the United states and they leave us at a mess\nWhen the president showed is that what nationally the kid he thought about it very hot and it is wrapped up and they connotations or the nest aggressiveness dominance of one race on one country over another\nThat way you view the word nationally when you hear Trump talking nationalism do you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay thing there and MSNBC Trump is using the quote dog whistle [noise]\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's saying\nA terrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has an equal the virtue of nationalism [noise] and\nHis point is that he's a conservative Israeli writer and a political ... Faris and his point is that nationalism as properly understood this post World war two or twenty first century nationalism\nIs merely stating that country's deserve to have\nTheir focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist do all the gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to preserve their history their culture their language all those things that they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and the this applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nAnd includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the last half to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the left they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico according to Fox that just broke paleo so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assaults on Mexican police I guess either okay\nAh let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura\nLet me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen with the president thank you how my job last night at all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us today [laughter] but\nI I have to tell you that this is a show this is another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it\nAnd the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she'd signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched is well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years oh All right well we need to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life I remember brat\nCame onto the scene when he unseated Eric Cantor now this was back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against a far left a woman who ah think she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened\nBut we are going to uh we're gonna fight to the finish on this one is well congressman Dave Brat will be with us and your phone calls aid five five forty Laura who are the new sensors now\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that though I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a metro brain ... average of the brain and stroke\nAnd I was on my desk but that was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days and three months later I came home and the wheelchair and double vision\nI had to learn to walk again to speak to engage in one in one is to write the alphabet you know if I went out and did a little something might come home I'd be in bed no I'm up by like five thirty in the morning and go to the gym I Do shopping I cook I energy all day I mean I feel great\nOverall by whole outlook just feeling my mental aspect everything everything is better\nFor a little bit of time use discount code Laura and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law as I said it\nOr we're just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the\nBernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar socialist health care pitch and ending Medicare is you know it double tax rates personal and corporate\nThat put you an automatic recession depressions so that that's the direction it it it's just like you said it forward commercials backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this\nWas the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country and why they come in\nAnd set the terms and set the rules and the left so want\nThey want they want is kind of take those issues away and neutralized tromp on the campaign trail in probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and that won't work immigration you know it's Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the\n... an article in the hill yesterday the Democrats are just sarcastically\n... on the issues and just saying you know well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why start now there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and so yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion debt\nThan and catch and release you know these are all children of God coming across the border right like the Catholics are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill right so you run those basic issues by that by the taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you don't do grow the economy I taught college for Twenty years last the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out by the decent job\nThat now it it's just day and night that the economy is just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers one statistic what's really interesting it's just the job mobility people are leaving their jobs because they're not confident and go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so\nAre the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know\n... ... ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nThought but there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offering result they\nWant to resist like you said they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on\nAny of that of course not so what is she in fact many of the question out asking his final final days why why is she ... and\n... why is that why is your challenger\nMitt spanberger hiding on these key issues in the the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state\nThe the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers Virginia but she's answering in these glib a cliche isn't bromide to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding\nI Would keep saying that whereas she why she didn't\nWrite write one of the things she hired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her high but she worked at a a Saudi a school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because he was\nA anti Semitic anti American anti woman\nThat was a far right what hobbies fundamentalists Saudi training school produced terrorists\nAnd after the fact she says she still proud that you work there but like you said if you're proud of the fact that you worked at a school that is they have school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she tried to your policy platform she's getting her position on\nHealthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI'm playing ... I'm On a plane soundbites and this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before the midterm let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a semi he's still going after George Soros another dog whistle for anti Semite Donald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if\nIt was the largest slaughter of American Jews in American history won't change his attitude is rhetoric nothing will\nWell I got it yeah it it it sounds different from Joe ... someone who was on CNN with Allison ... uh but I don't think she'll luck I bet that's the sense that you can't say the word global list but why why not I mean\nThey're the left his use the word global is plenty of times but again they are this story is one day and they want to take the college speech code mentality in voice it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debate\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they are creating manuals they tried to take your strength away from you and\nTake away your strongest points right my strongest point is Iran as an outsider I voted that way right my small business score is a hundred percent and uh I have the support of all the small business folks across my district that set or I'd sit around all the county\nI had the support of all the small business folks across my district et cetera I sit around all the county\nAnd so they're taught to talking point for me it I don't get around it I'm being paid off by big farm but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right a talking point is right they're very smart on how to shift the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate would win it Ninety ten they have to ship it off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that oh I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting around that way on me and so now they're just running crazy false commercials you know the biggest thing I Can't believe with the national media it it it's it's just horrible the house voted for pre existing conditions ripe to help people with preexisting condition\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the leftist running on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year but you can't cut down on fake news\nIn unreal now well Dave Brat\nA is a is a classic independent thinking Virginia and the type of person who the voters of the seventh district badly need representing them in Washington someone who may not be cowed by the threats from the left and who knows how how injurious it is\nTo the
