concentrated and they're all true obscure aside\nBut the special offer it gets even better as Dr Lehman told you you were one of the first one thousand college from this weekend's radio show purity is going to give away a free bottle of their delicious B. twelve energy mouse\nHas a remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined tell so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just\nDecades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turn to oversee the green tea in the current human your new green tea yarn liquid ... formula which purity given away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich getting richer all which is super hot right now here with some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual I Know some red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows\nUp and cranberries what we know about ... ... is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body that happen during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin sensitivity ... helps to protect against\nThose things it's a powerful immune regulator\nAnd you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us\nHealthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this\nIs why it's considered one of the keys to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be\nKey in that and additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the curriculum and with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resveratrol you'd get brain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well\nChristmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you greeted injunction maturity ... I Know that ... he's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years ago to chop reading the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottled up this green T. C. R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first\nWhat does this she are seeing foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid ... why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human and there is there a troll\nThe big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amounts the reason that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid and very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when\nYou have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines\nThat means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients in the supplements so Rene tc are as green tea Kirk human ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredient\nOf course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complimentary bottle of green tea see our show me this you wanted to buy this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five ... human plus the spiritual I mean you spent close to properly least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles and store\nAnd yet today purity products is giving away free bottle how are they able to do this\nYou can consider it\nKind of like if you are and what I mean ... years each leg returns\nEver since and were there any ... which will return to regular programming\nGee I don't mean you don't\nNeed to do yeah they keep calling [noise]\nLook ... get that yeah and and the other who your\nReal quick on\nYour ...\nGoing to be mostly now\n[noise]\nAnd the you know they have yet to Colorado and land on the on the the big sort of caught I mean now you have to have\nMore people to sign a huge ... ... feet fall fall trying to find out if I knew my andme assumed that is so small that many got knowing he falls on Sunday\n[noise]\nGuy Jeremy ... more than one out of there has been buddies all see I don't think there is\nSome all tell me the handle and we will do that though did they just don't build don't the forty that put me on a\nSecond about that let me add up all of those that may go to the football on Monday morning when you're older\nYou know but I had to come and go but yeah the big sort of God I Love going thirty miles but not if it got to see a lot of the other media can learn how to read a lot bigger Joan Bennett God what broke I didn't want me to go home with the\nMen that are more than a lot but I read the let me sort of don't blame me oh we\nAre better than I thought I read that because border you know what I mean sort of like you don't want to do with my grandma in Jacksonville ... to ... save your soul in Jacksonville ... ... do you have to do that for everybody I don't know\nYet but I read the dog park and also the jak because border that could be anybody that does is it the preamble does that killed on a boat certainly come but yeah it'll make me go with sort of caught a lot better but we're not tell the\nStory we wouldn't have to let the people that I thought they could drug it found it was the only thing that I went through\nAnd they do have people that I mean money makes you on that are going to put in southern food that I Would say that while I may be kind of good will what did the Jacksonville either hot or the ones that are well you see a lot by by their boss you see all think we're trying our down if\nThey don't have people in the hour we'll have you\nGot to be so\nIt'll be committed\nSound downloaded that Sunday they loan but I had my daughter she started out in ... when you talk a lot about what some of\nThe money for much longer for that though I Am a former CIA package on the football I mean he got to hang up on you or to see a cabinet connection\nGoes for\nMilk that but if\nYou want to have done it to the you know that you know then then I'll do that so you know to the movies you know similar legal leads you to tell\nYou know somebody has to be on\nTen minutes on your own [noise]\nSeeming who sent me this time [noise]\nIt looks down near the gum [noise]\nYou know what I mean\nI think anybody you know the answer may make believe Americans are what are we tend to include me in and when you really want to be in the\nOnly going to hear now do these little dots that book because but yeah those are the big heat the do support the beat that to live without a Minnesota and they let the let that\nBe nice if you just have been you know who they are but I must be but it must be on", "show_name": "The Peter Tilden Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "21"}
