all they need to say and say well you know we ... we should have said that if they come out and say that\nWhich they're not supposed to do\nThis is over because that's all the dense needed that happy

can ask whatever questions\nConclusions over Trump better at a press conference and he just said they they can mask whatever questions they want to go where he wants to go but but the FBI is not supposed to draw conclusions I understand your point that they called me already set that person but I I don't think it's going to happen again not that I'm In love with the president is a director\nI don't know where they get these people from the same thing with Jeff Sessions very disappointed in both of them that they you know they don't understand what they're dealing with they have to be aggressive they have to be strong\nSo they're both pretty uh disappointing to me let's go to Steven in Pensacola, Florida Steven Iran was mark\n[noise] um are you\nReal well how are you Stephen\nI'm good and I just wanted to add to the border the conversation you know during testimony she was very confused\nAnd I don't mean confused about her cat slowly regarding God with all the first leg when

just come in law and order or I'd like to caffeine you try to reach out a bunch of what you want yeah she also said no you got to remember this only got ... ... what does that mean to you understand that they really want to bother issue\nRegarding the choice to the ... the ... bar graph it [noise] um she also didn't understand the term on your behalf regarding anyone speaking to Congress after she had taken that cast well that one didn't understand the tone\nGo bury evidence\nYeah the one on on your first thing you said about coffee I I don't hold that against a actually that makes her look sympathetic in some ways but the thing I remember you're right when she said what does that mean on your behalf that kind of surprised me a little bit [noise] um\nBut I mean not only not only did they ask or a blood drive the bus Peter tried to explain it to work and she's still didn't get it\nYeah well you're you you make a point which is that there are a lot of things that are surprising but again as the other side which is if you micromanage anything uh a lot of us will look that good right I I think it is key the only thing that the the interviewer or that's what I Want to say because she didn't seem like a prosecutor from each\nOther ones are the what was her name the ones that the Republicans Mitchell yeah uh I Would have thought she was going to go somewhere with the whole thing you know very gently do everything in ... and kind of shows she got her and all she got I guess the flights\nYou know that he or she said that she didn't want to come to Washington because she's afraid of flying or whatever it wasn't here she took all the flights I thought she was going to pile on all these inconsistencies and I thought\nThey were gonna have to get them to see like what I expected which probably is why she wasn't there and the second half right you guys all have great calls are mostly yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota sure your own was marked\nBy mark Hi how are you well good I'm\nOut of a couple of things I'm the last caller was talking about her um her inconsistent even our behavior um I look at like two different types she was how\nConfused when they actually has gone up later Arnold looked like she never heard of that before and what I Do and I mean you know she and she had those ... I don't know if anyone else do that but those glasses looked like they are either I thought that she never clean them and it almost gave her this little sad confused kind of look\nAbout are actually on the one hand yeah I I\nI actually heard that you had including the glasses for thirty five years\nTo get on the other hand she got two master's and I'm sure it and she teaches in two different colleges\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect the H. D. degrees master's degree you\nKnow I'm just saying I'm just saying there is a huge that um this parrot maybe that's not the right one now but I had a huge difference\nSays the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say there um when they asked her about her ... and she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she's got some health issues I respect your health issues\nI'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cellphones next we'll end what are called her and said well you know\nWhat happened you know she I remembering sure like eight miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my family and you know I didn't see by it and she tell her that she was reading at least give her a car and say you know what happened after I left or any of that was kind of things that get federal budget hole in her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYet what are you disappointed in the prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax in\nI did and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she was God my heart sank because I got boy oh boy this is how the rest of the day goes we all were done for and I was\nSo proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and and anybody that you know make fun of him for

can't win because if you've been Tom they would have said well he was accused of all these turns you to do but not find something and the other state when I was to ... to be a justice if she can't win

thought we are at least the left I thought they believed in redemption and they haven't got the left that wants people to be forgiven even those who commit capital offenses\nBut now the teenage years are in play and maybe soon part of that the junior high ears\nAnd by the way I Believe you confess to some sexual assault ... senator Cory Booker during those years how come you were still in the
