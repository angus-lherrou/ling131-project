subject\nI've listed the ... the major things that provide happiness in life friend's children parents work marriage health\nVery few people have them all so what if you don't have one of them\nThen

no children or a lousy children but maybe you have friends\nBut\nThat's how big a deal it could be\nNow the the reason it was raised earlier I Believe ... for me God is central to my happiness God and religion where the ... because I Am aware unlike most secular people\nAbout the oblivion and darkness that ...\nAbout the oblivion and darkness that a secular world view creates\nThat this whole thing is meaningless you're here for a speck of time an infinitesimal least small period of time between non existence and oblivion and extinction have to remember the term that one biblical critic who's

from the secular ... world okay and let's go to Tim in Rochester, Minnesota\nHello Dennis Hi\nAh I'm just wondering how you um you know\nIf you ever feel it all just I don't know I'm all guilty the right word but you seem to hit a the right note on a on all those categories and I'm just wondering I mean you know I think it's easier how their happiness our [noise]\nI mean if if you are you know sort of been a successful and all those areas I Know that if I were\nThose areas I Would probably have that happiness our I'm On my show every every day I mean\nNow it's a natural that okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long time no\nI have not had a pain free life by any means I've been divorced and uh it was a very painful period in my life\nAnd if the only time in thirty five years of broadcasting where I had two years while broadcasting was when I announced the end of my marriage or my ah\nSeventeen years and I\nI went through a lot as a result of that or I mean it's not been a smooth road in my life I did not grow up a happy child I became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy\nSo in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do happiness out so the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches\nAnd I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think ... might well I don't think you could do what happiness our I don't think I could have written a happiness book I wrote the name of my book is it give away happiness is a serious problem\nIf I had all these things how can I write a book happiness is a serious problem I Would write a book happiness is effortless\n[laughter] slipped through the book would have been [noise]\nSo uh what I Do however is I live by the words that I give you advice um\nYou know very recently I took a terrible falling hurt
