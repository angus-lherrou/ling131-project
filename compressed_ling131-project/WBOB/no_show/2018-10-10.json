intelligent man\nAnd he growing up in the first half of the twentieth century had issues with the injustice that he saw the public the sword around him and as a result he became a communist in college before he dropped out\nAnd so much so he wasn't just the sympathizer he became an agent over the Soviet Union the nation wished to destroy America\nHe became the conduit between the Kremlin the forces of darkness inside Moscow and the hidden agents that covert assets in America especially within the u._s. government\nThis was Alger Hiss is on the ground job he had a very very a prestigious day job he was a writer and editor he ended up being the or the editor\nOf on one of the senior editors of Newsweek Magazine [noise] but ... history intervened in his belief system he was an a vowed communist covert agent undermining America [noise]\nBut then he saw his hero Joseph Stalin uncle Joe as some called him at the time it was to excuses murderous actions he saw his hero sign a deal\nWith the

of show\nTrials killed because somehow they did one misstep uncle Joe became paranoid and that was it they were killed\nAs a result what changes do he went underground with his family he fled for his life thinking he might be the next victim all based on his pitch this man who had made a pact with Hitler\nThen World War two ended\nAnd his ... he is and um what do you could chambers\nFound guard he found truth he found the Bible and he reinvented himself he\nCompletely disconnected himself from his communist past and decided to tell US government the identities of all the Soviet moles that he had been for the conduit for inside the U.S government the FBI wasn't interested even the Truman White House\nWasn't interested until the issue landed in Congress this is in fact when Richard Nixon's

and says I Know where the ... because I was the age that Kay kept them in touch with Moscow and one of them\nIs none other than Alger Hiss a darling of the left\nA champion for the Democratic party former advisor to the U.S president sitting at the table\nThe Yalta treaty that concluded World War two\nHis denied it said he never met this man this is crazy\nAnd the left went to work\nFor speaking the truth they accused where the chambers of being an alcoholic\nA closet homosexual or being responsible for his brother's death none of it was true it was all lives they ... him before Kavanaugh was even born\nBut ... his was found guilty of perjury because why would it get chambers had the evidence when he went on the run he hid the evidence of algae his\nIn his own handwriting being a Soviet agent with his brother\nAnd a farm in Maryland actually in the pumpkin patch\nAnd those micro fish films sent his to prison and long enough chambers died\nThe known a deep crypt of intelligence intercept of the Soviets prove to the world that algae his walls in fact\nA communist agent left to try to destroy what to cut chambers\nBut they failed his book witness is a testament to the truth
