about the ... murders\nOn Saturday and I say that when it comes to religion God I'll leave that morning Dennis but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails\nWhich sweat the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses where you go back to high school to examine teenage behavior or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech or when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media have used that to pile on President Trump held a along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days to claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNot like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote the threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new it is not an aberration it is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch this river Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are\nHave preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke and they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violin conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves these angry right wing man's oh it's really folks [laughter]\nHave been openly or hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lies even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the moms were real so\nThat's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit it but thought crossed my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want to kill anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he do that while conspiracies on the right\nDid he name some real ones of course not they never named him and how about left wing conspiracy dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this this is one you may be familiar with that President Trump colluded with the Russians you've spent two years on that one and as far as I Know it's still cold\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason on or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the second attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox so here he's picking on Fox not that I Want to defend them was former Obama official climbing that's what I looted to the President Trump's rhetorical helped lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sector state I there wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president created anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate but we're unjustified\nSee at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know what side he's on an even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course and what to some of them site is proof\nThe chance of lock her up\nThe phrase fake media or even worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way tell me in the crowd that crop first because it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show whereas I was filling in for the week that I'd be willing to give her a pass I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she ... bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never do [laughter] I was being facetious I wouldn't be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenged means that I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that but you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I have to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer except what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that it's a ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want them to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that as one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence the other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people\nThere'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and there are beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding expose Qatari evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah\nThis so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters of\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer objective reporters and a part of some of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the truth so for example and I'll talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother never mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that\nOr the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone is guilty of a crime catch this that shelter also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever reporter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lack the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank account they just don't have the right documents so of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports and so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own\nDecisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right\n... and\nI\nDo you all know about ... food storage let me tell you or it's quakes hurricanes floods every week there's another disaster in the news are you prepared\nOr your family have food during a disaster sixty percent of all households are not

that people make and I was going to make this girl are over there and some of the others and I don't even think it's true the percentage of illegals or he won't admit their legal she calls them undocumented who commit crimes or even less\nThan American native born Americans so watch if they commit one crime in the here illegally one murder like Kate Steinle each time we go on and on\nThen that's one that wouldn't have been committed if they weren't allowed to enter the country that is a crazy argument\nMuscles to kind of thing President Obama would do you set up a straw dummy\nIt doesn't matter from the percentages of same they shouldn't be here ... those people would be alive that girl can't think of her name and Iowa most are named musician resources\nHave better spent on
