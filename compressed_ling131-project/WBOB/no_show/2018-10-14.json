Michael good to be with you again\nThis week status off a little bit of trivia you know I I Do those things and we all the years I've been involved in history and whatnot and believe it or not even after all these years there are still things you can learn more and I myself saying I didn't know that\nAnd during the past few days I became aware that course um universities are noted or they give out a lot\nAnd so um so we did that three years ago uh last year we actually embark on what was called the tax cuts now a tour which was really good try a the importance of a tax cuts for all businesses across the country and individual\nAnd then this year we have our tax cuts work dot com tor which is really to try to be able to talk about the successes of the ... better jobs back and really what it's doing for economy for also for all businesses whether you're small medium or large\nAnd therein lies a good deal of what we want to hear from you today and um how things have improved over the last couple of years here ah for small businesses\nA lot of folks think back and and we still hear it to this day uh you know when Ronald Reagan did his tax cuts and and then people looking they should they talked about the trickle down economics you know that\nOh it doesn't work they said and um [noise]\nBut here recently we've seen the numbers that showed that the economy is now in better shape than it's been a year's\nOh yeah it's great point where I get I mean it's a major right now when you look at what the economy is doing I mean the the these are these are numbers that truly are now the envy of the world for Twenty one percent GDP grows a record low unemployment in fact I think we just get a three point nine percent unemployment rate\nAnd there's something very ... it's called the use six ah unemployment rate which really is just a real employment number that includes people who are a part time jobs who wants to work full time that number was actually quite high under the Obama administration because so many people were driven from full time to time works because of Obamacare\nLike because of the the onerous regulations that imposed on small business owners they just couldn't keep a these these workers I wanted to be full time workers as full time so they move them to part time we're seeing the reversal about which is just fantastic but we're seeing on the unemployment rate's Reagan\nReagan record lows amongst all demographics will talking Hispanic black Asian women I mean just across the board these numbers are record low and in fact are the first time in history actually happened or job openings about six point five six point six million just the latest number that I've seen\nIn about a job but the elbow and just about six million people to fill them so we're we're we are really in a great position as a country\nUh and I have to tell you now the small business often as the sky high now when I talked to small business owners you know they're talking about how they're taking the savings from the accident jobs back and reinvest it back to their businesses whether it's you know they're buying a new piece of machinery or a new truck or frankly just you know paying higher wages pain better benefits\nAnd hire more people it's it's a great great time right now in our economy\nIt sounds like you're doing a lot of credit to the tax cutting JOBS Act like you said what specifically in that and still is really helping small businesses\nThat is great point and and and I I Would be let's say that the uh the the removal of so many regulations what I call it really is now an anti regulatory environment right where we still want the types of regulations that keep people safe but it's just over regulation\nAs being a removed by the Trump Administration if you recall he promised\nWhen it first came into office to regulations off the table for everyone introduced\nActually removed twenty two a regulation minutes ministry ... covered the twenty to regulation for everyone to introduce an enormous effect on the economy the latest estimate that I saw which was twenty six teams go under the Obama administration was that that overregulation used to cost me economy about one point six\nTrillion dollars per year I'm In\nEconomy about one point six trillion dollars per year um and so we're seeing the removal of that really helped me to see my the economy back to the accident JOBS Act of course we've seen the corporate rate cut\nOr have been a big infusion of cash back to our economy the company's hiring more people giving higher wages and bonuses across across the board with just the latest retail numbers are starting to flow through intact Home Depot just released today\nA record number in terms of revenues are really being this that and that's because people are feeling good about their environment about their jobs their wages now right we're seeing wage increases so up\nOne of the big big benefits so that came out of the JOBS Act is really this what's called and against starts with a walkie expressions are but it's the needed expensing what that is actually allowed are small business owners to do is to go out and buy a piece of equipment\nAnd instead of depending on kind of the ... year five years setting your tenure depreciation schedule they're able to me deeply appreciate and expense up\nThat piece of equipment that investment in their business immediately and the ... tax here that have had a huge huge benefit we're talking from small business owners whether it's a printer that they're finding\nAn extra print or a radio broadcast for example they want to buy a new board I mean when you're seen investments all across across the country these types of investment\nAnd the pass through on this uh I Would also in perhaps we might be a little more time on it\nBut it would seem to me that as these things improve for small businesses even some of the larger companies might see some benefits I I Am where I'm going to list is driving at this grainy edge of the outflow of jobs that we got\nOver a long period of time move people\nPutting huge offices overseas in the customer service with people you can't understand\nThat but it's true I mean it it it just use it makes sense for these ... abroad because they were having to pay such huge tax rates really very very competitive with across the globe\nI'm now at the at the new corporate tax level or the Twenty one percent rate it's just so much better in terms of the you know go global competitiveness um jobs are coming back we saw apple for example announced the three hundred and fifty billion dollars\nOf revenue excuse me a profit that were part overseas are it's going to be coming back to this country vestments an R. N. D. and people knew hiring I mean we're seeing this across the board so these large multinational that frankly we're claim that country\nPlaying cleaned this country and the jobs as well they're coming back\nAnd I thought it was very very exciting to see that because it gets economics at work right and you know we hear Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer said oh this is just that they were ... rich back at that well it's actually benefit from for corporations to be able to invest back\nInto this country into the businesses here and so what we really have that now we have level set\nAnd frankly NATO and us an extremely competitive market for people to compete and operate and and I tell you that people who are really bemoaning the tax cut\nIn Ireland for example I'm telling you you look at some of the newspapers out they're very concerned with what happened to us because the benefit that used to exist for them for you know for our U.S companies\nTo go overseas is no longer there\nDo the job to stay here and that's why we're seeing the kind of optimism\nYeah I was going to ask you um well how would you specifically respond to the Democrats when they say you know all this does is benefit the core big corporations and rich how would you respond specifically on how small business benefits from it\nWhile you know what what what Mike I think what that shows really is just so many of these so so many of these Democrats just have never actually run a business I own a small business myself I'm actually to small businesses one which had contractors in which has a direct employees\nAt but they all had large ... all my my biggest customer for large companies right and one thing I knew for sure when large companies well I did well when they didn't do well I didn't too well\nUm if you remember there was one of the lowest points really in our economy when things are really dragging all the Christmas parties were always canceled right\nAnd what would happen because there was no money to spend Christmas parties right every single dollar mattered and the same you know ... ... companies were cutting chocolate and write well guess who gets impacted you know the local deli down the street\nWhich is a supply that right which is a caterer does but it's a different party and guess what the and the guys who were inclined a deli meats and the bread try it I mean how that ripples through the economy is so clear\nUp the only people really have never run a business make those kinds of statements because they know that when the large companies that well medium small does the well because those are their suppliers and in fact some of these companies have direct\nA edict basically within within the companies say we want to look for small business we want to look to minority on business as women do businesses right we want to do business with them so when they do well small business well\nHow do we reached that point in time where we have to take a little bit of a pause along our network line\nWe want to remind folks that they are listening to the Florida round table a surface of Florida's talking entertainment networks I Reagan stance on Michael you have a special guest this days Alfredo Ortiz he is the president and CEO of the job creators network\nAnd we'll continue our conversation following these messages\nOn a fly somewhere looking for cheap flights or cheap tickets\nAnd then call that tried to call a low cost airline travel hotline now for prices solo\nWe can't publish them anywhere low cost airlines has all kinds of travel deals domestically and save up to Seventy five percent even fly internationally and said even more yes fly anywhere in the world and see a lot of money on your plane tickets\nWill even save your money with cheap rental deals when hotels rental cars even rental packages\nSo do you get to calls for\nThe absolute cheaper prices on us and international airline tickets in the hotel\nPrices solo they\nRight for stay in business insurance always have to bring in actually one dollar more than the pay that\nAnd the way they Obamacare which set up that wasn't the case it was the reverse or was it was destined to fail actually\nAnd so we have to control health care costs the president has taken two major initiatives I wanted to help on what they call kind of nice to be short term plans um which now we're or limits only three months or allowing charities CT scanner planned out to be a little bit longer term and potentially go over here to\nAh that's one big fix that he's done and also stationed health plan\nIt's a big opportunity for small business owners to band together to be able to buy insurance are really across state lines and healthcare benefits frankly core their employees you know that one third of small business had to drop health care benefits or the second Obama Care really introduced because of the sky sky rocketing a\nHealth care costs that it was bringing they just couldn't afford the Koreans anymore so sort of small business has dropped that so we've got to have the opportunities that are going to help our small businesses to address one of the ... the last outstanding issues which has healthcare costs and benefits\nAnd frankly by doing that it's going to help them better compete for very very hard uh you know sought after labor now which is the\nLast piece here that's always kind of a little bit of a slip of the good news right when you have really strong demand labor going wages but you also have a labor force that frankly is really tight it's hard to find good labor is what I'm hearing\nFrom our small businesses and partly is because it was clearly crisis a lot of these are potential employees\nThey may look great on paper and then they can't pass the drug test Mike I'm In that is really very sad and that's that's a car every single state in this country we're having this issue and a lot of that is driven by the the the Chinese drugs the\nToys that are coming through our borders a down south into into our country are really just a hitting every single state\n[noise] it it is a large thing and of course we have seen that in Florida and I think there's a little bit of repeating here because most allow a lot of folks I don't believe actually understand this\nWhole uh the\nEnforcement Obamacare caused so many employers to shift jobs to a part time basis and say no you cannot work more than twenty eight or twenty nine hours a week because we can't afford this health care bill as it was it was a very big deal\nHuge huge steel steel and unfortunately I rarely it a lot of our labor force or discourage them to do that a surprise to me to say they just said you know what I'd rather just opt out I just I I Can't afford to be a big part time\nNow do are we making progress in getting an amended the obviously they didn't throw the whole thing out but it it is being I hate to use the word tinkered with but it is being amended are they making good progress\nThey are making good progress I mean obviously want to you know the most important pieces that weight which one vote short of getting repeal and replace path\nA but what what has been repealed and replaces the philosophy that we believe that that drove Obamacare originally that philosophy has been repealed and replaced by a much stronger philosophy which is about really free enterprise\nHelping this out and allowing\nA a you know basically patient choice to be the real driver and allowing a just economics and and this idea of free enterprise to drive health care choices for consumers employees across the country and so that's being done through the association health plans and throughout their policy is being put in place\nA out of a health and Human Services department as well department of labor\nYou know we are once again at the point where we have to pause alone or network line who would want to remind folks that they are listening to this little round table surface of voters talking and her team uh networks\nI Reagan Smith from Michael yeah very special guest is there's no free the war to ease ease the president and CEO of job creators network if

why\nYou're listening to the\nTable is service is low to soften entertainment networks I'm Regan says Michael yeah\nHum services load is often entertainment networks I'm Regan Smith Michael yes very special guesses phase phrase or\nThe the president and CEO of the job creators network and I'm afraid we know that drew a very busy man and we want to say thank you for spending all this time with us today\nWe're drawing this conversation a man before we run out of time all we know that there is a website that you know where folks can go and find more information we went to we want to get that up there\nAnd also the fact that you folks are going on a a a tax cut to her and we want to hear about that so uh let's start with a website\nFor great Baker Reagan tax cuts work dot com is a website against tax that's worked dot com and on that site we really try to bring to life\nAll the great story that aren't being told fortunately about how the taxes are working for Americans for hard work and small businesses across this country we actually have about forty five hundred story so far that we've collected\nA small business owners that are just whining about how they're making these tax cuts worked for their businesses and for their employees and really how excited and often is that they are about the future now a ... again you know the job creators network\nIs also putting on the tax cuts work bus tour and in fact of the second leg a bit of the summer fall legs just kicked off last year\nAnd we're working away across the country with the two different buses making about fifty plus stops\nAcross the country with twenty five state than we are literally rating going from corner of the corner and a quarter of corner of of this country from you know from Rochester New York up to Spokane, Washington down to Orange County California down to my aunt uh down in Miami, Florida\nAnd then pointed between we're all over the dark to bus is really trying to spread the message of ... you know the great news about how things are really working and how tax cuts are working for a small business owners and we asked other small business owners out there to please visit that website\nUp you know provide us with some of these great stories and we promised to get as many of these stories out there as we can some of them we've converted a into into actual um you know videos or they didn't montage is that really brings to life some of these benefits\nUm and it's so important that we love story telling 'em in and and and we think that it needs to be much more of that\nBecause that is what's going to I think to make the difference when people hear these stories\nThey're going to finally go you know wait a minute I hear on CNN and all these other you know are needed to disarm it get right now and it's not it's anything but that these are working and we've got to make sure that when November comes around people remember that these tax cuts work so thank you\nAnd you were just said to November comes around that's because I'm a member of we have the mid term elections and a lot of people are predicting that the Democrats are going to retake the house what happened to retake the house since ... specifically with tax cuts\nWhile you don't like it it's funny because I think a lot of those same people are the ones that that predicted that President Trump didn't have a chance and and and now a right to win that Hillary Clinton was going to be our next president so I take that a little bit of grain of salt that some of these guys are saying that\nBut um it is going to be a tough election uh she's in the November a tough midterm dishes historic in nature\nOr because historically I'm a you know the the party that is empowered tend to lose a on the house and the ... or
