represents Minnesota and the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and then Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrats because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault harassed than when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith\nIs campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she has said because Keith categorically denied these accusations then Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the um uh unsubstantiated allegations against the judge Kavanaugh\nA seat and he tore under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI an investigation and she also said that Kavanaugh has committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all of a sudden the proof is on those that are accused and that's it
