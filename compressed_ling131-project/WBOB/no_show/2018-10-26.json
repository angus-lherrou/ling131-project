about morality mailing speaking about happiness and identity\nThere's no identity human as opposed to what as I said your mother walked turtle\nI don't see how that can contribute to one's happiness\nI could see how celebrating being French or being Japanese are Being American contributes to your happiness but I don't know how celebrating being a human as opposed to 'cause it it all of these or in distinction identity by definition is in distinction\nTo obviously that's fine no\nThere's nothing wrong with that it doesn't mean that others are bad or that you hate others that's that's that's what you learn in graduate school but it's not true in part because he did learn to graduate school\nSo uh if if you if you celebrate being French then you're not celebrating a being a Paraguay him as that is correct or American that's fine I I think it's great you celebrate being French good\nLong as I mean if someone's there aren't obviously immoral components to your celebration but there'll be true but anything\nBut if you're a human ear are celebrating um human as opposed to what it doesn't mean anything there was no other things that you could be okay that was important okay everybody let me\nLet me talk to you Long Island New York Susan Hi Susan Dennis Prager\nHi thank you for taking my call uh I agree with you know I'm I feel secure and less for three components I'm a woman I feel blessed that I Love this country gate to me and I'm a Jewish woman and I try to learn and I left my religion on selling those areas I\nI feel coming clean about what I Want to ask you is that\nThe constant I fell off on these identity they need to explain myself the they push of if you will um far leftists forces which are attacking these identities I\nI don't know how to handle it any longer I truly don't because I feel that's how much of who I Am but so many people I have to kick and about\nAnd I try to I think the phrase that you know try to kick shut down by cutting off with my friends peace in the household peace in the world but it's becoming increasingly difficult because\nI think they can move towards them slightly isolated especially in the demographic where I live I live in New York I live in New York center then and there you have it so I feel what I fear ... about the environment\nHow many of the year ... feel\nWell I have one boy and he's actually the thing and then found out and he's he's good [laughter] he he's also\n... who do you have who do you have these conflicts with\nAmong my friends my friends and family friend you extended family\nWell look I I hear you I don't want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true [noise]\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it I mean while there are many ways I shouldn't say the only one way to handle it is to find kindred spirits otherwise you'd be very lonely be\nBut if it's a challenge to find kindred spirits to that in New York City isn't that interesting I mean of course I don't know Susan but as soon as she said she celebrates being a woman being an American and being a Jew I just assumed they knew her politics\nBut interesting very interesting defining element in the ideological rift in America thank you Susan I appreciate that\nUh ed in Chicago hello ed Dennis Prager\nNana thank you so
