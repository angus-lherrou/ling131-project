things quite quite a remarkable thing she\nDid use it they lived label her I just saw a or something from the Harvard faculty listing from the Nineteen nineties she's listed as a Native American and that's the way in which works\n\nThe American Indians the Native Americans have totally disavowed this even though they tend to be Democrats anyone with grievances tends to be a Democrat by the way and Native Americans have a half a legitimate historical grievances there's no question about it\nBut\nAre worried about the Native American issue it's a tragedy there's no real there's no other way to deal with the issue of what happened to Native Americans they rolled around North America as free tribes\nIn other words not oppressed by outsiders they pressed each other I mean I'm reading a biography of Andrew Jackson now gigantic biography the guy is clearly of more liberal bent as as most historians or to find biography I'm not complaining but\nEven she if a team and he mentioned the

discovered\nWhen he came to the Caribbean which is where he got he never got to North America and\nUh he they they they literally literally eight people they were ... with a camera that was the name

they go\nWithout a bit of a better world this is what I asked people wouldn't have been a better world if no Europeans came to North America\nSo you you would have what would you have in North America today\n... ... or we honestly going to win visions that North America would have remained almost ... very minimally populated relatively speaking by American Indians\nWho repeated didn't each generation and what they had lived in the past generation it was a cyclical view of life\nThe the European world as a result of the Bible lived a linear life the belief was that life moves forward there was something better to be a spy or two they failed often but it but it did happen\n... ... every other culture in the world every non Bible based\nCulture was cyclical\nI learned this from in a
