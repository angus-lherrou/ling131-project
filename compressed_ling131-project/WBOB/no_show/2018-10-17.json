Fort ... up over forty percent up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nWhat's at the core of it I mean by the way that's a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one their range of social science that may be indisputable point children particularly boys raised in a single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail and\nSingle parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life to develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be divorced or have out of wedlock children themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all and so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest is a long term success\nThey're very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better our leads the Republican Party is so focused on marginal tax rates they don't feel that sort of the province of ... they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggests that single motherhood is is\nLess preferable hum than uh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of a lie that unintentionally in downplaying or ignoring this problem meanwhile it got the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood\nI live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to maybe some of your listeners do and you know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody gets divorced there no single moms on my street\nOf course not because the ruling class understands that marriage\nIs the key to prosperity and happiness and said they don't practice this themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low it's the middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem not attacking anybody I'm saying that you really cared about the middle class you would be doing what ever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children intact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera so I think\nThat Republicans incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realize hey we talk about social issues we're doomed\n[noise] but but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was in the sea from that moment until now so I can confirm what you just said that that equation they group but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm for lower tax but keep our taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in Congress and the president willing to sign it what's very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up their civilization will collapse so Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues\nYou're on a me and your civil society grow out of the kind of life you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on end because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants they didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nYou're smart ones are what are they regret it now oh really no I don't want one leads you to lead you to think that\nBecause I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks\nAnd not a lot of really great people and nice people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past forty years and America has not become more conservative and the smart ones are asking oh where do we go wrong\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard but they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nOnce he should care about is the way people live the family is the very center it's the Adams in ... the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope\nDoing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I saw respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the ... the majority the strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump says\nUm I think ... I think you need to understand from ... Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress settled in Congress wants to get his program into law so on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the questions that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet style longer exist so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking\nSince Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we still Afghanistan's seven teen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat his genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to\nYou need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who I signed a intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes the sumo how long do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell why\nPut their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved on there no surprises me because I'm involved from the beginning to the end\nBy the purpose in doing that is ... grows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument and yes you do that gravy and yeah I Try All right Dr\nBless you great to be with you and folks whose ... jumping demonstrated on\nWill be blessed not all the individuals of the euro all the families that's the basic you\nKnow the chair of I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite products because I sit on it every day\nAt work when I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I said oh we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees will thank you which is nice and end up itself could simply try it out go to ... chair dentist dot com there is a thirty day guaranteed so easy to send back you do show no questions asked\nX chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...

credit but I just want to understand something I Want to understand the mind to the shellfish individual ... do you do you think she would like it or didn't even occur to you to think about it\n\nUm\nI was well again being in the mindset that I was and it was I had planned this thing and it was\nI was kinda sell it to her hey it's going to be great either never been to the Ozarks you're going to love it and she was eight months pregnant and ... and it was it was an ice storm it was miserable we enact that tell us a heartless global but you know\nWait wait you know on hold on one second one second I'm just thinking am trying to imagine [noise] I I get it on your part because I read somewhere women in the the latest a part of their pregnancy love\nIn in the the latest a part of their pregnancy\nIce storms in the Ozarks it it it is so\nScary that you would have said that [laughter]\nDidn't study this\nStudy's exactly study yes [laughter]\nSo so well and so it's a place to say we returned of our honeymoon and I don't think we knew each other enough to to to logically get married and so\nI was not sure I was ready for everything coming out of a divorce or ... and having a Second Life in a life that a child\nAnd it was that this time I did my burgeoning then burgeoning faith because I didn't know a lot of questions about my lifestyle about how I was living and it made me stop in kind of step outside of my own desires and my own plan for my life and\nI allow myself to really get to know in in in in doing that it there's nuance to it you know listening in\nAnd finding out about her her ... and life goals and she actually had a couple of rough years financially you know from a marital standpoint\nShe actually taught me a native unconditional love and\nAll the ... in friendship commitment to Fifteen Years later\nYou know so overblown but every single day is a blessing every single day is is a a a life that I Will never again that'd be blocked off so you know what\nA great marriage\nThat is one beautiful beautiful story\n[noise]\nI I was I'm very touched the lesson my friends about is the lesson you know try to learn from all these things the lesson is to come to me Ozark\n[noise] uh this was a powerful call [laughter]\nAll right let's go to a [laughter] All right very [noise] ah let's go to Heidi in Chicago Chicago's really coming in on the\nHoneymoon issue high high high be\nHigh high high it's okay I think you know I found that I write I haven't had\nTime to say that my husband and I want a very unique story we were both in the Army National guard\nWe got married and very soon after we got married we found out we aren't getting applied to Iraq and we as a married couple that are hunting line in a combat zone and\nThat I

missing in this country because of the sick people who produce power a television and movies\nWhen was the last movie or a this is not a rhetorical question I may I I'm I ... I may be pleasantly surprised by the response but when was the last movie\nOr TV\nSitcom or drama about a beautiful marriage\n\nYoung people for decades now in the United states have not\nBeen shown the beauty of the beautiful marriage\nSo it's no wonder that marriage it's one of the many reasons it's not the only one I think the breakdown of religion is the biggest but this is a big one too\nThey can't even imagine it I mean how many Heidi's did they nice\n\nIf the if the people in Silicon valley with their their tens and hundreds of billions of dollars wanted to do something positive for society they would have ads on TV\nFeaturing especially women featuring women\nWho are attractive in every way and I'm I'm I Know this is sexist and all that\nJunk because people don't want to\nApproach reality but obviously with the person is it looks looks as ... as someone who is a\nQuote unquote a winner and saying you know what\nI got married and it's the best thing that ever

but that let's go to war that might actually be a good predictor about parades oh Indiana Tony Hi\nHi down there it is an honor to speak with you share life experiences\nThank you very much\nSo my wife and I been married about nine years on and when we got married we both recently joined the army so we were active duty soldiers and I'm Ari uh we were heading off to Colorado we were stationed in Colorado so\nI don't get up getting married um and then we just had a nice little dinner found the cheapest a hotel we could in Chicago\nState than I together um and then a ... a couple of days later a packed up the car and drove to Colorado to start a new life now being that we were both I'm active duty military wait for the first thirty six months that aren't so first three years of marriage we were together\nFirst thirty six months of our suffers three years of marriage we were together physically together approximately Eighteen months at that\nTime you know what I ah my point is for your listeners that\nWe principally are are pretty frugal people and when I look back on uh on on our uh when you brought up this topic and I applied my own um experiences of a honeymoon um\nYeah but you know funny move you know you you didn't have a whole a honeymoon right that's the point that\nIt's basically yes because we couldn't afford it\nRight you didn't was ill okay yeah so and so on yeah go on\nA I was the point being is that um that that was a foundational principles and our relationship as we didn't we don't live outside of our means that we felt that if\nWe had to listen to own a you know\nAnybody who stayed the night of his marriage at the cheapest hotel in Chicago is frugal I got that\n... it was chaos for all of our eye five fair about it was a camp up for us\nAll right but in all seriousness your your your actually eat your story which I thought it would actually make gate my ... my provisional theory\nI actually sustains it is that there really is no relationship between the honeymoon and and marriage it it it's it might be good at might not be good I mean you another example of no honeymoon great marriage\nRight well we we also had planned that even though we discuss hey well you know when we can afford it and the time is right well we'll take a hunting within a couple of years ago we actually\nRile kid on a cruise together without the kids and what not but you know what I could afford it\nWell that's part of that my dear Tony thank you it's a it's a thank you for your service to both of you that is another subject which I have in fact cover it and I need to do it again and woman remind my producer about that\nI Am a big fishy an auto a family but I Am in even more adamant to fish out of all of a marriage and therefore I think you need to take vacations without your children\nOn occasion with the children it's great fine if you could take that many vacations more power to you\nBut if you can't\nYou need to you need you need to get to you need to have time together\nAnd is a family vacation a is generally not a romantic get away for parents and that my friends is what is known as an understatement okay thank you Tony so far we're pretty consistent\nAnd let's see what a\nIt's a ... for example up to Beijing Bloomington, Minnesota and bar the famous Barbara Bloomington Hi\nHi thanks for taking my call my story we're both in the
