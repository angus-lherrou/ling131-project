the capital fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now right and and uh you don't make a great point in the number conservatives are the left by the way that it doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this is United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump ... ... it has it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party and a couple of things that they wrote here there's the Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid Mrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks found her lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed an orchestrated the ... accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive in this assembling but no action in his presidency comes close to matching the partisan viciousness\nOf the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms mhm\nUh is as a media sometimes for best to be puzzled that more than ... percent of Republicans across the country told pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their mess that methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished is Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservatives who threatens their grip on power sure\nRepublicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false village but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August called to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit\nVoters notice or is about the left will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that and for the American left\nThey're all deplorable ... yeah I think that's a I think it's a great piece and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nA ... here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the left will go what the left is about ... and that's it and and\nThere's just not something you usually forget there's what another five weeks are less than five weeks now before the election\nAnd I think\nThis is not going to it's not just a motivating factor for the election I think it's a motivating factor for the Republicans in general I think it's a motivating factor for those in power [noise]\nUh not just to try and retain their power\nBut beyond that to do something together as a party and and get to work on a number of agenda items let's see if that happens\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know a high FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee is private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... the law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which they hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day unverified in order to\nDestroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign [laughter] we got to the law firm they were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS to me they were you could look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and\nI Would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it\nAnd lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm that would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative\nProcess why would why would the counsel for the FBI do what does that say well as well as he says\nTo talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election\nBut it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys\nNo it was attorneys and attorneys meeting so former\nFBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm mhm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the ... court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah\nYou can do with apple a seasonal you could do probably more seasons in law and order a couple of seasons of it because it\nApple a seasonal you could do probably more seasons in law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking that so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and\nOr changed because of change then to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the\nPeople the party that was making the accusation they were the ones who colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today is\nHeld by the way if it's an verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false after [laughter] after ever over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and ... well faking it as in televisions instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign is exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole five to court and you everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on their behavior the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active smaller and his team are still working which means it's still relevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know ... right ah thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a no cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do it whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats did what Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret\nYes\nNow that we know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it secret they could have kept her name sacred now I mean all the processes yes they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this\nThing move forward or if if you look at this I mean this is where we got to have she'd done that in July we may not know Dr Ford's name because if it was part of the three oh two and was not backed up by anything\nThat information wouldn't have been made public it wouldn't have been made public anyway the vote just would have happened and it would have been either yeah yay or nay on Capitol eight six six Ninety right I

to take my time from a my wonderful guest then you'll have anger over the wall Street Journal who's written a major piece today and we're we're discussing essentially\nWhat I Do believe is a turning point I didn't believe it really till yesterday or today\nI I Do believe that a lot of conservatives who are ambivalent or even hostile to the president now understand he's not he's not their enemy the left is is that fair\nA fair and um I think it has done as remind a lot of conservatives a lot of Republican\nWhy they voted in twenty sixteen I'm\nYou know the Donald Trump got about sixty three million votes they weren't all the lunatic fringe data and as we know a many of those people voted for Trump for a couple of reasons actually warned about Donald Trump himself many people voted because they understood\nBut the future of the Supreme Court with that issue a Trump or follow through on that promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch and now a Brett Kavanaugh the other reason many many people voted on the twenty second in a lecture and wants to vote against Hillary Clinton\nVoted on the ... election wants to vote against\nHillary Clinton because they are the implications of the
