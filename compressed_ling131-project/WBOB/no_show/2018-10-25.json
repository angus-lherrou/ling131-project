I\nI think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party\nBecause keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and\nThis is her you heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the main stream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... or you know with my ... my party in at ... approach or you write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah ... that's what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holy because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats ... but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that you're not\nA Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA lizard with war and or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nEach because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have so\nThat's the effect is that combat one Harris or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party\nThat is going look or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or\nYou know and side with as you're crazy Democrats she as she just did as ... and\nWhich is the perfect example and that's the thing that endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and where\nDoes she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the ... Kevin ...\nAnd that's my I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back ... that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the boat and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior or not you know all of that that's you know

this massive migration highly organized migration of first that you know speaking with with a president morale is and if the you know his intelligence officials as well as hunter and official\nThe leftist leaning groups in Central America particularly in Honduras former presidents ally of were involved in this according to their intelligence and what they've been able to gather so\nPeople connected to left it socialist organizations inside Central America really began to mobilize the groups in Honduras\nUm weeks ago and in fact a week before that they weren't hearing rumors that something was happening that they believe there was going to be some kind of mobilization but they weren't certain and another thing that I found very interesting was that there were some according to the people that I spoke with now I remember I still have to investigate that\nThere were people within the United states people that belong to NGOs or the department official that we're very close to you have a leftist leaning groups\nThat were also somehow\nOn the outskirts involved in this according to people that I've spoken with you know some of the groups that NGOs that were down there is

the Congress even his own party or should the dishes on tenable a book the he or she persisted and maybe your friends and then was kidnapped them it was it was remarkable timing number industry so my first question\nIs what we want to the left him in Latin America half the game with this caravan\nMaybe more I Want to be more precise maybe the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats ... only helping the Republicans\nAbsolutely and I think there was a great let's calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example was ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history was ally and it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America or not she stabilizes our ability it drives risk in\nOur relationship we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this flow of migration coming across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand is that Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back\nAnd forth you know to a very a theory that Central America on it so they can't really

Hillsdale anyway back to a professor and we're talking about his book in defense of Andrew Jackson\nSeat when we're not allowed any longer and that this is I I lay totally at the feet of the left we're not allowed to have any moral\nNuances it's everybody basically who lived before us was in various states of sin and the left today is the purest of the humans that has ever left that is really how they look at themselves I promise you folks I'm not in any way exaggerating\nAnd so all of these ... the founders were were were worthless because they had slaves\nAnd uh you just go down the roster\nBuddy ... the the Indian issue was a very very complex one and there were there were terrible things don't Indians in the it's a terrible things to others including blacks who may enslaved including other Indians who may and slaves and torture was for some tribes routine so\nIt's so there's no is no easy answer to this problem and\nHey it's so there's no there's no easy answer to this problem Andrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in finding a Indians and uh he adopted an Indian\nChild now so I just am reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making or should I Move on\nYou know I actually think that that's what I Would love to jump right back in the court yes he\nWas in of course I Am I understand ... commercial but the point I wanted to make was that\nAt the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people may have been really really went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indians and for the resettled west there were a lot of people who thought why is Jackson spending money of white people\nThat read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so Jackson at the time so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what are we the left doesn't have the time it was a really complicated issue and chats and it was very worried without question he was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate a birth rate\nThat they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding them in al populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to the thought now the again the execution that that was horrible by his intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book now you don't normally defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\n[noise] you know it's one of the things I've found so I think we all know that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever could be applied to women or children that was the same actually for blacks as well as for Indians and why\nDid the prospect strangely enough thought or beautiful enough yet it's strange interesting respect that women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost warship bullet times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman and white wearing very very well but the other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found Dennis and you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did\nAnd I think it would it kill his soul to have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest that that's how much of a stickler he was about living out this deep deep profound on at the end his integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well so we get a couple of getting quite a few good things in a number of tools that he had been a pre teen and then a team has a Thirteen year old he fought", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "25"}
