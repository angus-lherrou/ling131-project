that's a fast moving storm you know we'll have the latest update coming up here in a little bit the other big story a stock market down eight hundred and almost eight hundred and thirty two points ... uh yesterday looking at ... or the stocks are overnight everybody's taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and also it looks like a that a ... the opening\nLooking at the Dow futures right now will be down\nYou know maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things uh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category but just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I've talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happen to be talking about that last night\nRight and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThat's just in a year it has doubled that you know\nThat means there's more money that the government has to pay out just a four in ... she got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out or did we do this on the air off the air about\nUh that uh because uh ... what we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it but a mortgage rates out up over five percent which means uh the price of housing or could be coming down to\nYou know to make up for the uh the higher rates unless Eric's idea of the one hundred and twenty year mortgage comes along\nYeah you're kidding me I mean if they're doing that for if they're doing the what is it I think you can get a loan for Ninety six months what is it uh it's it's I Know it's well into the eighty a month\nWell then what balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place well\nWhat you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because to his point\nWhat do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about\nA long term effect uh you know you have ... G saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight well oil\nBut that that Senate emission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they fight as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as\nGood as it should right because if you were saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and really has a you know a ... ... if your point is a and indeed destruction that they should wait\nYou know Jim Kramer saying that is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well\nYou are admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy\nBy any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be like ...\n... regulation and taxes because that's what a tear ... doesn't\nMatter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business it's always going to hurt\nWell and and I will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if you're going to be long lived if if they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the terrorists even in the situation with China\nBecause it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U. S. uh than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing\nThat uh that fear become the reality in the economic numbers than the market will also a general and the other way of\nYou see positive news coming out of leadership in Congress or we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing\nHave to thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing right eight six six Ninety right eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to judge many problems before heading out on the road\nPost trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post trip inspection check to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached and free of any excess of where\nThe train or can and must be watched properly and the jobs of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety dreams are attached properly\nTh truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance ... is a service a TA truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shock\nWas already ... regardless of what our radio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you by freight line or drugs\nHow ... how do you like your coffee got it the way you like it at highland mine J I call him our typing with great he thinks he planned locally roasted\nProved fresh every hour ... flavors you can watch no wonder it's called the ... you want to have we\nGot it at highlight flying J download that might not have even more [noise]\nEveryone eventually sees a truck scary inside grocery store shelves\nGoods to help the community\nProducts that keep the business running\nWhat they don't see is what the trucker ... inside you're driving your history why would we do we see you know\nWe see you carry a career that help support families communities\nWe see you carry the title of friend and neighbor parenting provider we see you carry the sacrifice numbers adherents job will\nEach was a determination to get the jobs\nWhen you carry inside is more valuable than\nBecause it's what's inside\nMany of you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation links dot\nComs trucking for news and entertainment Web sites like Netflix you can watch brand new original trucking shows the videos me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else all the transportation\nNation dot coms trucking shows and video on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nTo do is sign up and start watching plus three that's perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now\nDoes your walk radio I Am six hundred said one of those one at a are you worried about what ... water\nWater quality should not be painful and worrisome hydro care water systems from way home solutions with the most advanced purification technologies go way of homes allusions to bed one eight eight eight nine seven three wave or go to best water now dot com\nHydro care will eliminate length scale because it's hundreds of dollars in damage to pipes and appliances without using sold well water will no longer smell or staying your fixtures city water will be purified of harmful chlorine led arsenic and chemicals\nWave home solutions provides the cleanest healthiest water at every faucet satisfaction guaranteed for more information call one eight eight eight nine seven three wave one eight eight eight nine seven three W.

radio he's are humming I'm Gary ... eight six six tiny run I so a lot of teachers in the experts looking at the futures overnight the Dow futures think\nThat we could be the down as much as three hundred points to start off the day now right right and you know so you're you're talking about eleven twelve hundred points uh and and who knows what happened the rest of the you know the the day you never know because\nPeople might try to buy whatever but it's it's the fact that it was as you said when you look at it it was the worry\nFrom the tech companies and a lot of that has to do with regulation mhm it's about trade\nAnd as you mentioned the one company as a PG PG ... right and and a caterpillar a company is a deal and international trade their stocks were down right where did people put their money and utilities what does that mean you put it in utilities\nWhen you think there's going to be if there is a possibility of a downturn in the economy ... or say people are going to be using\nElectricity they're going to be using gas that you have a market\nThat isn't that all likelihood going to crash in any way so uh you know we've got trade you've got interest rates and the bonds you've got the fed any interest rage you've got regulation worries uh in in the tech sector and trade and tariffs\nYeah and it it the the the market will assessed as they always do or what the life of these concerns in terms of terrorists especially is going to look like I mean is that going to be a long term thing and it really comes back to the the policy by\nUh the administration they're going to do are they going to stand their ground with China or how long did that go on all these questions being asked in a lot of uncertainty that really\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area\nA thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and George and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks\nUh around the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle\nAnd so you know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding and inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest brunt is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to any more but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but still is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore\nA hurricane Michael again one for\nThe record books you and I I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about uh uh this would be a or hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled in nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nAre affected Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart over land and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants then again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and you know and right because it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical\nStorm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and then regained power is considered extra tropical but it's ... you write in in nailing it here [noise]\nThe it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there because it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWow it really is traveling and and and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there and the high profile a truck so I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that\nAre and they know their season driver they know that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will the kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that is a main quarter of course between Florida and New York\nWell and um and then go ahead to some to some degree they're going to have this stuff that they're back the winds and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five\nOr twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up and the Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads of why I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington that that goes into Seventy seven through Florence\nAll of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars\nUm just beyond that position number four in the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five and the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about a continuing to grow\nReally intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about a continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm atmosphere was perfect not\nIn the last hour drive from nine twenty two to\nNine Nineteen and it was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\nAnd a ... and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning\nShow [laughter] either up [laughter]\nHundred and fifty yeah why and then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah\nThe ten I'm as typical Airforce base yes frightened Kendall as a radar and that radar was queer aid as it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear he'd at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed\nWind speed there are a hundred and Seventy seven miles an hour well now that doesn't translate to the surface but it obviously\nUm there were probably that were easily guess over a hundred and thirty miles an hour and ... and this particular storm that made it down to the surface but that's just to give me an idea how powerful this thing is and again I have to thank all the people who ... went out there and report it uncovered this\nUm and and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there had had their hand held Anna monitors this time\nYes they're down here and I\nSaid I didn't want to have anybody walking behind him with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah actually yeah kind of ruined the drama if you will you know and and that's you know if you look at this ... a storm eight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael came\nWith his own drama or it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go\n[noise] I make anything of it it was a storm that\nJoke for itself and its intensity right or coming up or we will ah that we will\nWhat will let you go back and get a nap after we talk to you [laughter] ... and we'd greatly

also where as well it makes perfect sense how can you hurt somebody unless you think you're better than them\nYou don't hurt people you think your worst than right the murderer thinks you know who are you a me I can murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I couldn't you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are very offended when they're arrested there just offended I Can't

who are on losing teams\nIt's ridiculous to okay so you ... okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be bored with buying one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child of God I couldn't agree with you more than enough to self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God high promise you do okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ...\nThat is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it [noise]\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd ... you know okay if you're even laughing that so that that proves right point so there's there at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think a highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nOkay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved\nIrrespective of religion ... grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing
