B. O. B.\n[noise]\n\nAll\nMy friends are here to be with you on this Friday immediately opening up with one of the most distinguished people's health of our time in my opinion\nThat when Stephen Harper was the prime minister of Canada which he was\nA for nearly a decade between two thousand six twenty Fifteen [noise]\nI Wish I said to you I think the best leader in the world at this time a Stephen Harper I said this when he was listening you smell listening but I said it was it I said that he was in effect or Ronald Reagan of Canada\nAnd now I have him on the line of use his book is literally hours it published today or published this week right here right now and it is his faults um what is happening in the world today specifically\nThe phenomena of Donald Trump the ...\nIt is today specifically\nThe phenomena of Donald Trump's a phenomenal and indeed there Stephen Harper the phenomena of other leaders and so you ignore ring of a lot of their own citizens\nBut of course I Will let him explain what he's written and just say that it was an honor to have ... former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the lawn welcome sir to my show\nYes thank you and thank you for your very kind words I I Do know that you set it while I while I was an office that I appreciate hearing it now at first\nWell I'm Glad you knew it while you were in office that that seems a lot to me\nI by the way I just ... just before we START I I Love Canada I have been to nine of the ten provinces I've spoken to nine of the ten provinces if you could arrange a speech for me I'm prince Edward island\nThen I can say all I'm saying [laughter] so [laughter] I I mean look\nWe will keep that in\nMy building cloud [laughter]\nThere are there are pretty a limited speaking opportunities\nThere I have with a light at the [laughter] ... [laughter] pretty limited pretty key to these I was your best to reveal just they were All right so tell us to see some of your book\nSo\nThat I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that for instance prime minister but in the context but two roles I now have I run my own global consulting business in which I have one of the things we do with it by\nThe clients around the world about political risk and political uncertainty and and how to respond and prepare for that but also on chairman of the idea which the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states\nAnd uh since twenty sixteen I had been observing a obviously a theory of\nNew and unorthodox and unexpected electro ... Donald Trump selection boat primary victories in general election victory was the big us but the upset ... breakfast referendum though I was so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of this so that is really the essence of the topic and I get to put my thesis in a nutshell\nThere's a reason is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nStar star five five six that star star five

here on the wall street and thoughtful people um international politics [noise] former prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper was a major fan of during those ten years\nI looked to Canada I have Canada envy it wasn't for you to you and it was actually real I I did I remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful intelligent conservative prime minister\nShow a prime minister Harper by the way I just want to know what I call you prime minister Harper is that an American thing only in Canada when you're interviewed or you called Mr Harper prime minister\nUm well that there's a long answer that question Denison I'll keep it short which is in Canada\nOfficially we do not keep the titles are we do not keep the title prime minister but it is actually quite common for people to call me that nevertheless\nRight on so I was right Troy issue but I think it's more of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's nice but I was just curious well one of the reasons we love\nYou [laughter] [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're ever feeling down just scored a barricade repeal speech\nIf you're feeling about just go on a barricade radio station ... exactly [laughter]\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the more storms full of people as I said him international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won why don't you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day so I\nTell people I was surprised I was less surprise than most I had\nTo include it mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth the u._s. than my own experiences going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and the final weeks had told me they thought Donald Trump was going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless ... chance of winning\nUh so I was I I'm not that I Would still a surprise but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance to conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been uh polls go back and forth we've been uh you know within the margin of error and a lot of them um uh the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government's\nI think the issues that are on our side of the area we paid in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that\nUm you know we have very little in the way of conventional\nConservative media television every network is MSNBC and Canada um is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec if you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario you would not imagine the conservative party is going to get any votes at all and yet they won the election and won it handily\nSo I'm a I'm optimistic but a book I leave a I leave the day to day of Canadian politics the my successor whose\nName is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider conservatives in Europe this comes up and sometimes they say if only we had to talk radio Europe\nWhy isn't there in Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio and kind of\nTalk radio does exist and\nCandle I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nNo no it's ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio host not all of them but a lot of our best ones are have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years\nBut look at an area where there really is a deficiency generally and what's interesting a dentist about this is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well\nIn terms of audience likewise conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of meeting conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that the dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful you said earlier I did not pass over me at all all of our behavior MSNBC I Hope my school up that one that I look I'm well aware of that\nSo there is however and I are frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of its day to day reporting in calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I I Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial reliant lined remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah you have to do a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um um and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states with pod cast\nUm you know I think there is a big market in Canada for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom a kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me\nThat the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada\nIs that ... not to the same degree so it was ... but on the issues they differ ... just as clearly as the left right there for in the United states [noise] so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued wow why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalizations about our country but it's a fact that Canadians having more civil public discourse and always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal would be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between party is significantly bigger and Canada\nPlots that I think the other factor that often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties\nAnd that really changes the dynamic significantly like I always say when you have this strictly two party system you know if a candidate a hack candidate B.\nHe can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where he got more than two parties there's always a risk to the candidate in tax Kennedy be effectively the winner becomes Kennedy ... who's\nNot oh All right listen this has been a great honor ... book is right here right now it is with him is Prager dot com you\nLast night I spoke to twelve hundred people at the largest the largest synagogue certain conservatives talk there were three major nominations Judaism reform conservative orthodox the largest conservative\n... bruising battle over Supreme going all who is just the tip of the iceberg of what's ahead in the assault on our freedoms especially religious freedom all over America\nFrom the Atlanta fire chief who lost his job for writing a men's Bible study on his personal time to the Colorado Baker who want to seven to victory\nIn the Supreme Court this summer one organization is in the forefront of defending my rights and your rights it is the alliance defending freedom I support them and I'm asking for you to step up\nAs well just call eight hundred for six nine nine six\nFive six eight hundred for six nine nine six\nFive six or go to Dennis Prager dot com and click on me I support religious freedom batter thanks to a generous donor every dollar you will be doubled so you're one hundred dollar contribution becomes two hundred dollars or five hundred dollars becomes a thousand dollars in the\nFight for religious freedom so please join me today by supporting the work of the alliance defending freedom\nHave folks I'd like to tell you what smart and what's not so smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes Mel Watt is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Prager unlike other job site zip recruiter doesn't wait for candidates to find new zip recruiter finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills education experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast\nSip recruiter is rated number one by employers in the United states just raving comes from hiring sites on trust pilots with overwhelmed sales and reviews right now my listeners contrite zip\nRecruiter for free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter dot com slash Prager zip recruiter dot com slash Prager one more time zip recruiter dot com slash Prager zip recruiter the smartest way to higher\nAttention all man here by I ran the allies lead you down but your best days are behind you think again if you suffer from any type of ...

be\nCondemned to a miserable life just to stay together is ...\nCondemned to a miserable life just to stay together is as strong as always struck me as morally indefensible\nBut a a child a child's happiness my point is the child's happiness should not be permanently yes it will be temporarily of course\nBut it should not be permanently affected by divorce however if you spoil the child or a few

just graduated college and uh and then I have a younger son and a six string\nWell so okay well the youngest son is obviously not an older child\nHonor I have some I have a lot of thoughts on this question and one of them is just for people to think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school or will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really or has it emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nYeah and even into adulthood and\nEven in the delta okay yes okay so I'm gonna just use this to say a few words and I thank you for your call\n\nThis is a very uh it's a very
