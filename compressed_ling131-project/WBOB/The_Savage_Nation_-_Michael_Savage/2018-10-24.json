and you know when your heart of hearts you don't believe a word that the right wing would do a stupid thing like this for two reasons number one\nWhat's the point number two or none of the bombs went off thank God and you know you want to get into this really\nKind of dramatic way\nYou've got a lot of people on the right or ex military experts in the detonation explosive devices I don't believe that the bombs wouldn't have gone off the right of center I mean I I'm Glad they didn't hold things seemed like a Halloween prank\nAnd you know here's the greatest proof to me where have you seen today on CNN or MSN any of them\nA picture of the uh uh ten thousand or twenty thousand young strapping soldiers coming in from Honduras\nThese warriors they're all war is you got to understand something people from Mexico and those countries are are phenomenally great fighters by they went to separate story everyone knows for example even though they're not Mexicans that the Mexican boxes are about the best in the world because they have a rule that comes from such poverty\nThat they have one rule which is always keep going forward they never back up the only way to stop and Mexican fighters to knock him out everybody knows that in the ... in the fighting world\nSo you got the same type of desperate people coming out of ... Honduras strapping strong young men and every day we're seeing at the march gets bigger the Democrats had a backfire blow up in their face you're talking about a bomb that bomb blew up the Democrats face the bottom of the marchers\nNobody wants them here so what did they do I think this is a stunt that so\nThat so genie on WABC New York thanks for listening line seven go ahead please\nHeinz ...\nI got just speaking with you know I'm I'm a university but I have CNN there is no anyone Don and put it on our place\nYeah and then there is no anyone under God and on and put it up on our place if I found without anyone noticing how her everywhere at the time\nYeah you're right you're telling me that Clinton was ...

skeptical of this little game that the writers even more cynical out with them the middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen as they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they're liable actual send one to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine or kill that's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on that and most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it isn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I have been trying to tell America for a long time now that there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics\nAnd I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace they only know hatred of war\nI saw pictures of the illegals coming over with a new group from Mexico joining them and they're all strapping young men of military age and and clean the clothing that semi headline was give us your tired your poor your gangbangers\nThat so what do you want me to say what could I as a citizen with a radio show say give me your tired your poor and you gangbangers so what can they do so we have an a gigantic problem because we voted like crazy for Donald Trump\nAnd so far with thanking God that it was Hillary Clinton which is true and we've gotten a lot it's a lot of good stuff but the Alamo now is the illegal immigration army that is surging toward the border\nThis is his Alamo and if he does not stop them it will become has Waterloo you'll have to refer to Napoleon to see what the Waterloo was\nAnd as a student of history Waterloo was not a good place for Napoleon in order for Trump to stop this massive army of invaders and to make sure there's just not a Waterloo for him and for America\nHe has to crack down as fast as possible on Mexico and make them do the job that they promised to do when we were finagle into signing the NAFTA deal with them because they're that horses out of the bond as they say and American parlance show how we're going to stop these vandals from getting into the country how\nWell I guess I have to read a little history to you but you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals in the ... when the barbarians in other words broke through Roman broke the nation and a half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men\nBarbarians how do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a mob a Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical\nSo let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand\nA small percentage are bad people very bad people of the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races\nSo why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly controllable I Know we're not supposed to even talk about it but this terrible crime in this country especially if you're in the media and you read about these things\nThen you have the deranged walking the streets but I think it's important that your study for one second with me if you don't mind a little history I have a minute or two to do it with I I Would do it and I'd say forty minutes if I had a podcast right now which is what you'll get come January I wouldn't cut it off but\nLet's go back to ancient Rome together and let's see what happened in the early history of Rome when the barbarians broke the empire into and how did that happen\nHow it happened that the Romans couldn't defend their their borders which will call their frontiers how did it happen that they broke through\nWell as I told you the whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know when I hear the whole story that you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small soundbite\nAnd so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire in the in the east and west well as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as a described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was lifted a very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially and disintegrating Mara like wow does that sound like does the gym doesn't sound like today\nAt that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd guess what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and Daniel enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the ...\nIn North Hungary where the vandals and what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nLive is a God so ask us behind those in South Russia where the east guts or asked her guts and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then they were the Mongolian people's for signal way towards Europe so history is repeating itself\nLet's go to graduate school together in thought for a minute\nWho do you blame out both parties you want to talk about both parties or cashing in on them on the illegal aliens for the last twenty five to Thirty years you'll have to spell it out for you why do you think that the Congress is doing nothing why do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said\nWhy do you think Trump won the election because we want something done and he said he would do it that's far he hasn't so you could blame anybody you want\nTo me it looks like the Mariel boat invasion of Miami of the early eighties and we're asking that Honduras Guatemala El Salvador empty the prisons and then not houses because if you look at the pictures that are so plain and the picture is worth ten thousand words\nThey're young strapping young men by and large with a few you know in the front women with carriages thrown in for effect so that Jake Tapper couldn't the Yankee or guilt chain\nAnd Wolf Blitzer can chime in and say hey that's racist\nBut we all know what this is it's an invasion\nSo what's an existential problem what are we going to do about it I'm not just saying because the current or it I mean I read existential isn't my ...\nAnd as a a girlfriend so I Know ... as if it's a wonderful phrase it's an existential threat was originally use the here in politics by Netanyahu with regard to Israel\nA number of years ago when he said it's an existential threat to the survival of Israel and then everyone picked up on it but this is a true a truly an existential threat to our borders language and culture so the question is why\nIs nothing being done I don't see anything done nothing wrong to the next subject already\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight
