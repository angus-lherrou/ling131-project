... a lot more New York has the highest state tax in the country and then California is running a close second about twelve to fourteen Fifteen Percent in the state on top of federal tax which used to be duck to both from federal income tax\nBut when Trump's tax plan in place we can no longer the duct our state income tax payments from a federal income and so therefore we're actually paying more taxes in California did you know that no no this is this is a terrible reality\nSo that's the top income tax rate for individuals is thirty seven percent\nAnd that rate applies to adjusted gross income uh five hundred thousand or more so if you hit the jackpot you'll pay at least thirty seven percent and then state taxes depending upon the state you live in [noise] after all the gangs have to

you want a little tiny history about when Rome was broken into by the vandals and the ... when the barbarians other words broke through Roman broke the nation and half would you like to be a little little history\nNow do you find it offensive that I'm calling illegal aliens like this the army's this army of young men\nBarbarians how do you know who they are why do you automatically defend them why do you automatically assume they're all coming here to work why do you assume that in a martyr Fifteen to twenty thousand there are no drug dealers no right but snow killers\nKnow gang members why would you assume that there'll be a logical so let's both agree let's all of us agree that amongst the Fifteen thousand a small percentage are bad people very bad people\nOf the type that we all know exist in all communities in an all races so why would you want to bring in people like that to your country when we already have a a crime wave in the country that's hardly control of all I Know we're

whole story ready they broke through what more do you need to know where I get the whole story now you'll get bored I Know you tuned out already in the age of Twitter and sound bites the minute I said history you went to sleep\nYou turned on either um the nail gun\nOr a something that's a little you know small soundbite and so how did the barbarians break the Roman empire into into east and west well as I describe and stop mass hysteria and as a described to you before on this program\nIt began and the third century of the Roman empire which was listening very important for you to hear the ...\nThe empire and the third century was already decaying socially\nAnd disintegrating Marley wow does that sound like does the gym doesn't sound like today at that time in Rome was already decaying socially and disintegrating merrily and then they face the barbarians on the borders\nAnd guess what happened next\nWell all on the imperial frontier\nWhich ran roughly along the Rhine and then you enemies without pressing against the Roman borders the Franks and other German tribes have come up to the ...\nIn North Hungary where the vandals in what was once that Syria and is now Romania\nLive is a God so Wes Scott's behind those in South Russia where the east guts or astronauts and beyond those in the vulgar region where the lands and then they were the Mongolian people's forcing their way

I'm quite a few of those were converted to a conventional a warhead or the rest of 'em that\nAre said he wants to rebuild our nuclear arsenal so in order to do so he has to threaten war with Russia [noise] now\nI'll tell you it's not necessarily threatened war were shot while trying to do is try to eat all of them or maybe have a slight advantage or\nIs there any evidence that we outside as I can see which show that Russia has violated that Reagan Era agreement I don't know where that might be that I don't hold on the line I'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria so we might stop mass hysteria enjoy those Savage Nation Coleman oh eight five four hundred thousand [noise]\nFor many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like wildfire and time is running out to take action would you please not become the next victim in this battle\nPleased discover how to win the war to destroy your harder and savings\nMy good friends at switched America have detailed all the dirty little government secrets and there are updated report but it's free it's called the secret war on cash\nPart too it's available now by calling eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six eight hundred to eight nine twenty six\nForty six but it's important to report the secret or on cash this documents real life events such as banks refusing to cash ... cash being confiscated tremendous and citizens and much much more do to like call now eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six\nNow before we we move on got again if I had to park as I go for an hour right now I started something earlier in the show when I talked about the armies of invaders that are sitting on the border all these strapping young men and then I reference\nWhen the barbarians broke the Roman empire in the east and west and I talked about why that happened in the third century and the reason they were able to break the Roman empire and the third century is because the Roman empire at that time\nHad been decaying socially and disintegrating Morrow it and then the barbarians of ... appeared on their borders now what's shocking in what I just said to you\nIs that no one listening to the show could disagree with me that this nation is not decaying socially and has not disintegrated morally or you got to do is look is look at the people in the media and you'll understand what I'm Talking about all you gotta do is walk in San Francisco or New York where you see a man urinating on a subway track\nOr a bum dropping his pants in deprecating on a street that's where I mean by decaying socially then add to that the drug epidemic in the nation\nAnd then add to that the the Morrow disintegration of the nation and you'll understand why were collapsing as a nation\nAnd so who saved the Roman empire almost saved the Roman empire\nAnd that was Constantine the great he was a monarch of great devotion and great intelligence by the way\nIn in some ways I Know you're not going to like to hear this Trump is like our Constantine the great\nI've made comparisons of Trump to pass to start figures and they've fallen on deaf ears because the ... the literary folk in the media don't want to hear anything good about Trump but I'm sure they're educated people out there understand what I'm saying when I say ... he was constantly in the great\n... of great intelligence who did some great things\nAnd what happened was ... Constantine originally beat back a raid of the guts the guys you know about ... well you know what I mean the gods with black makeup and San Francisco they beat Baca right of the gods\nWho are trying to come in from the Balkans but he didn't have the will or the power of the government behind them to protect the frontier across the down you why he was too busy\nHe was preoccupied with the weaknesses of the empire itself does that sound familiar so Trump is facing a similar situation of a weekend empire from within and invasion from without you following this\nIt's a very big story to take me a couple of hours to go into but I'll summarize it for you in a in a thumbnail sketch because what happened was\nCaught some team did the best they could but then he died trying to reorganize Rome and what happened right after he passed was the borders of Rome were ruptured and the visit God's invaded almost the Constantinople\nThey defeated the emperor of el ends at Andrea poll they built the settlement in Bulgaria and from eighty seven three seven nine to three Ninety five there came the emperor the uh do see us the great and he was a ... a formidable and ... and ...\nAnd over the armies of Italy and ... presided still lucky oh he was a van dull\nAnd he presided over the army's in the Balkan Peninsula lark a God and I could go on and on and I don't want to go on and on just to give it some more history just to board your history is to bore me as a kid but the more I study these things I realize that America is repeating the history all over again in some ways\nWhich is a nation collapsing from within from social and moral decay as was ancient Rome and the nation being pressed on its borders by armies from without as we are seeing in ... in black and white and every color imaginable\nOn our borders were being pressed on our borders again\nAnd then what happened was after our lark marched into Italy and after a short sheets took Roman eighty four ten Rome fell apart and what happened after um collapsed did life go on for the average Roman listened carefully\nThe opening half of the fifth century this was remember hundreds of years later\nYou saw the entire Roman Empire in Europe become prey to robber armies of barbarians does that not sound like gangs listen to what I just sent this that area is outrageous some history\nAs the Roman emperor empire in Europe collapses in the fifth century rubber armies are barbarians were praying on the Romans citizen\nThink about that thinking about what you're seeing in America today where we as middle class citizens\nWe lock our doors we lock her cars we have alarm systems we carry guns many of us\nThink about this why you know you walk around the suburban neighborhood and look at every house they have an alarm system I'm not going into an ad every house has an alarm system every house is fortified like a little for\nBecause people realized that at night somebody could break in a while they're away at work paying the taxes for the illegal aliens to enjoy their lives someone could break and\nSo they protect themselves because right now we have the equivalent of rubber armies going around the country I Know it sounds rather hysterical but ... is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look\nAnd there is rather accurate if you actually read the crime there was as I Do and look at the data as opposed to the fake data put out by the fake media by those in the news business so\nI could tell you what went on in the life of the countryside after room was invaded and what happened to the nation their roads and forest became infested with robbers\nThe barbarians went into the forests or stop right there you're in California the barbarians have almost destroyed our entire ecosystem\nThe barbarians over in raising marijuana in the ... national forest these pristine beautiful ancient forests have almost been destroyed by drug drug cartels or raising marijuana\nNot only drug cartels we haven't digits criminals who have been destroying our ecosystem what's ironic to me as all these green left this to care so much about the environment have said nothing\nAs are sacred and pristine streams and waterways had been destroyed with toxic chemicals by the marijuana growers that are very national forest that one word from Jerry Brown\nThink about it the man is spends all this time conniving to hate Trump\nConniving to bring in more illegal aliens\nSays nothing about the army's that have destroyed our ecosystems it on national forest in their quest to raise more crops\nUsing chemicals that are banned and outlawed everywhere in the world to speed the growth of these plants and the waste is going into the streams and into the earth killing animals and destroying the ecosystem for many decades to come\nSo in many ways as I said to you history has repeated itself history is repeating itself\nAs I Try to alarm America yes I Would use the word ringing the alarm bell and stop mass hysteria I'm trying to explain to you about America's and Saturday from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunt and now the insanity of our time which

director for Obama tell me what tongues would be wagging on the conservative side like all\nSo how could you saying you can't be blind to what the other side is seeing if you are then you're going to lose and this is what's worrisome to me is I think that\nNot only we weigh the core base of this whole thing\nWe the people the core base of the whole thing I think we've become blind to the other side we may think we know what they think but I don't think we do and then if we were blind to what they're saying about us them were really in trouble\nThat's why I have to be the independent I Am and that's why I sometimes a great many of you people who wear the hats forwards or backwards it upside down even on Sundays\nBecause you don't understand what it means to be an independent commentator in this country because so few of us exist there are others here and there but I Am an independent so what does that mean it means I have to be critical times even up demand that I admire so much and who I back it's that simple\nIf you have a family member who you think is making a mistake socially or economically or in business\nAnd you say wait a minute that's not a good idea Johnny can't do that because here's what's gonna happen that's family isn't it family don't families disagree with each other whereas this blind loyalty this idea of blind loyalty coming from\nThat's not the world I grew up in I grew up in a world of free thinking and vigorous debate\n... actually a very American idea [laughter] free thinking and vigorous debate goes all the way back to the founding fathers it goes back to the constitution of the bill of rights free thinking and vigorous debate but seems to have gone out the window right now people have circle the wagons it's like wait a minute don't you dare talk to the Indians\nYou know what I'm saying that's what has come down to stay here stay or in the inner circle in the ... I used to call them Calistoga wagons but the ... circle then all of us wearing the hats have to stand in the middle and we have to wait for the flaming arrows flying over the tops of the wagons\nI don't see the world that way I don't quite see it in those terms\nAnd I still think it's good to have a dialogue with your opponents otherwise\nYou get increasing tension anger and rage hatred hostility leading to a total of breakdown of the society which is the last thing we need bravo Michael thank you very much I just applauded for myself and my own head because that's what we need to hear more about we did have more people saying what I just said\nLike give peace a chance you know what I'm saying like let's play a little beetles music together give peace a chance let\nCertainly listen to the other side not the ones who are pushing and shoving hit them back hotter as my position\nShe I say if we go low and they kick us kick them even harder kick them into the gutter it's that simple we go low they kick us and I got to kick them how to take them into the gutter that's number one but if there are people that wanna rationally discussion discuss things that's what I'm saying we should do\nAnd I would hope that the other side still has some rational people on it who are willing to hear our point of view such as let me ask you something missed the liberal from San Francisco are you telling me you really want another twenty thousand or so mainly young men strapping strong young men\nFrom the Central America to come into this country right now do you think that would actually say yes\nYou think that the city of San Francisco so liberal you'd be mistaken if you actually spoke to many of the middle class working people I mean professionals they may have money\nThere may have property new cars families you think they really don't know what's being done in the city you think they like stepping over human trash you think that they like seeing the windows broken down in their cars when they go to a restaurant\nYou think they like seeing them mismanaged and the point the buildings are falling over because of the corruption in the construction industry here or the advent as avenue is so broken up due to contract corruption that stores going out of business you'd think they don't see this\nThey don't see if they do see it and they say to me with a few times I run into and talk to them is I Can't say anything because most of my customers are liberals and they wouldn't patronize they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nIt's you know they'd be quite surprised to find out how many people think just the way they do\nIt no none of them want the illegals here none of them want another army of illegal aliens in this country an screens\nOn vetted some of whom are very dangerous some of whom may be diseased and certainly the social service systems which are already overwhelmed cannot support these people in any way so don't tell me that all these good Democrats in good old San Francisco want more of them that would be complete and total lie\nBut having said all of that it's now time for me to listen to you so I'm going to open up to one or two calls here on the Savage Nation\nRemember my solution I didn't say force to stop the world's biggest ah I have a bit of the Confucius I'm a bit of Confucius was gene pool of me which is why I eat a lot of Chinese food is the feed the Confucius within\nAnd the Confucius within said we can stop this invasion from Central America without firing a shot\nWithout even launching a troop I Want you to think I Want you to think about this the sewer alive he would have me as an advisor\nDonald Trump should absolutely understand he needs to reach out from behind his TV circle of advisors he needs to reach beyond that little world of people talking to each other every day with the same stories in the same mindset and the same pack phrase is\nHe needs to reach out to the western regions of this great empire of his and he needs to speak\nTo the leading intellectual on the west coast who is a supporter of his eye has always been and will be and understand that I just said Trump can stop this invasion without lifting a finger and firing a shot always got to do is lift the phone I'll be right back\n...
