from Europe ten thousand years before the Siberian originating asks the ancestors of the American Indians set foot in the new world ten thousand years before or the stone age people from Europe will hear how do we know that\nWell several dozen European style stone tools dating back between Nineteen thousand a twenty six thousand years or discovered at six locations\nWas dating back between Nineteen thousand and twenty six thousand years or discovered at six locations along the U.S east coast [noise] three of the sites are on the Delmarva Peninsula in Maryland\nA there are others Pennsylvania Virginia six discovered by scallop judging fishermen on the seabed sixty miles from the Virginian coast on a would have been a dry land in prehistoric times yeah that would have been dry land in prehistoric times that that goes into the whole global warming fantasy by the way\nSo that helps us in our understanding of humanity ... movements around the globe it doesn't matter what your race as long as your brain is still working\nSo all of these us European style tools on earth before the discovery go dating of the recently found a day to us east coast sites war from Fifteen thousand years ago long after stone age Europeans had ceased making such artifacts\nI Know you've already I last year already that's four or five ideas in one and in an age of the Twitter you can only go a certain number of characters until a brain freeze I don't know how anyone could teach anymore in this country you say you said three sentences together the brains phrase because it's not a choice of a certain number of characters\nMaybe I have to do three choices in a row then you'll on three news headlines maybe\nWhat's more chemical analysis carried out on a European style stone I found that image and you're back in Nineteen Seventy one guess what it revealed it was made a French originating Flint this is a very important for those of you who want to know the origins of those who actually discovered America\nYou see at the peak of the ice age around three million square miles to the north Atlantic was covered in thick ice for all or part of the year that was at the peak of the last ice age\nShe there's there have been six ice ages all of your dummies or don't know science a sixth grader who has a reasonable intelligence can tell you that of course we want to clean our planet but stop lying about men destroying the earth\nThere six I say just came and went so what what caused him to come and go oh weather patterns not caused by man I mean there were no cars are industrialization before the last ice age can't you put two and two together which is not to argue that I like pollution I hate it\nBut let's use use raised in here and science instead of being a moron about\nPeak of the ice age three million years ago I'm Sorry piece of the bigger the piece of the ... at the peak of the ice age three million square miles of the north Atlantic was covered in thick ice for most of the year\n[noise] and what happened was the seasonally shifting zone where the ice and that in the open sea began was rich and food she'll see birds fish penguin like species the gray dark\nAnd so the stone age humans went over to Fifteen hundred mile journey across the Atlantic ice that try and now they have found Newark New material they found in the early part of the two thousands is a stone age tools from Europe\nDoes that mean the Native Americans don't belong here I didn't say that does that mean you should be entitled to build a casino I didn't say that either of what you want to know a little archeology and a little science there it is\nNow these are the Europeans who came here over the Atlantic guys they may have been the first Americans [noise] but\nUh there were Asian originating Indians who went to the new world via the bearing straits or along the Aleutian Islands Shane after Fifteen thousand five hundred years ago so Asia Europe they came here\nSo what does that have to do with anything we're talking about it tends to diminish the lie of the left\nThat the Hispanics or coming here from South to the border I just read taking what's there's that's out of rubbish\nYou want to talk about that where does your history began when does it begin so let's put that kind of argument aside because what you have to do is begin with what you have now it's ... nation is this now not what it was Fifteen thousand years ago\nI guess if you want to get into origins I've just blown away your argument that they're entitled to take our land because there was never there is no no no\nSo let's put that argument aside and deal with what is now the second question is the second arguing becomes ah we ah we um I put it another way if a man is not willing to fight for what says he should lose it and put it to you that way\nIf you're not willing to you know the world is becoming an increasingly dangerous violent place\nThat's because of the immigration situation that's plain and simple everyone knows that I don't have to check a textbook\nAnd ask someone and yell at University of California weather I'm right or wrong the violence is increasing in this nation because of the increased flow of violent people who are in the drug trade coming into this country\nAsk any cop if I'm making it up let's start with Long Island MS Thirteen
