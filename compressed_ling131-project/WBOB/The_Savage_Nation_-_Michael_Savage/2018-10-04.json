listening\nWe complain bitterly under Obama and the liberals when they taxed and spent we said oh the Democrats stand for tax and spend well now we have an administration that stands for spending spent today on money and cut taxes and they spend more than Obama dead and you're saying that the the dislocation is so great that what's gonna happen is what I Want to know\nWell I Will tell you what

skin eight nine one or go to Jen your cell dot com you heard me right\nBut the ... years glorified Rapids sexuality free expression hedonism the accent of women\nAnd so the liberal why our government was so akin to what we're having in America today\nThe people felt good about it prostitution was the criminalized drugs what ramping laws against venereal disease were dropped\nJustice in America would dropping laws against using heroin now first they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this\nWhat else happened to the wine or a public that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority ramping lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated\nWhat else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about\nThe backlash to this liberalism\nArose right now for example it's a direct parallel to the wine or Republican Germany\nAnd uh you have groups like on the ... the ... cowards you put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street attacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world\nTeaching jobs or God Knows where they are with impunity but we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with the communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown stretch I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I said you many times those that do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the far today and the Occupy movements of today which lawless and violent the analysis of today and Don by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these farm and so the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that was still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units called brown shirts\nAnd they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you to be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest is the story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shorts at some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing did you and I said and so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong it's cost the left are likely to think he's at least the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass\nThose liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point to my show tonight\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions of extreme ... the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a gives a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much of what college student didn't you know when you didn't what did they do in college what Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat he ... he drank too much about a ... ... what do you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an operation\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left and it's super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong\nYou're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that she this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout in in the west a a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen that you can't believe are happening in what happens so fast she'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're the heightened now up in the stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money and under the Democrats when we criticize deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatism dummy up they shut their mouths you put on your anyone in the radio talking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the ... just before all of this that or take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how fabulous the money I'd become\nNow several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company has not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by enemies of Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I write on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the once great United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria\nAnd in the ... we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to despair to defy\nBack page three oh three stop mass hysteria be right back\nEnjoying the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred and Savage eight by four Hubbard seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation is
