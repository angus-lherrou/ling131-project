confuse the two and here's the problem missed the shift by muted by merging\nThey're radical politics with the ...\nThey're radical politics with the legit\nReligious affiliation what you're doing is smearing the religion itself and making the the larger population come to believe that all Jews are radical leftists which is where the problem begins at I Want to go into that today certainly not in this in this moment\nBecause as I was reading about the Nazi who did this this cowardly not seek to defense will develop and ... developmentally disabled brothers or this or their seventies and eighties some Ninety this was a cowardly act there was no heroism here\nI was thinking about this how did he know that of all places ... how did he shows this reformed temple in Pittsburgh as his

there's always a reason inside a crazy person's head I don't know if you understand that [noise]\nIf you study FBI profiling they will always show you that even a crazy person in their own mind as a

committed an act of violence senseless violence\nIn their own mind\nThey have a justification for what they are doing\nShould this lunatics that I'm going in after we saw the ... coming in on the southern border now you say what's the connection if you can't see the connection I can help you if you want us to sit here skating around the truth is that I've been trying to warn you about I Can't help you\nI told you on friday I warned you after the impotent bomber was caught\nDo you remember what my words were on friday do you remember how I tried to warn you that there are likely tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of heavily armed trained people in this country or the breaking point and if you keep spending on them calling them white trash\nTalking about them like their

clown and I wake up Saturday morning and I say oh my God\nOh my God look what just happened and who triggered this guy\nNow don't confuse my analysis of this cowardly madman for any sort of justification or apologies for him because I'm not offering that\nAt all but of course the vermin in the Twitter world will immediately tried to make that happen I've got one of them now from Miami, Florida who the FBI is tracking because their rhetoric is escalating you'll have no idea what it's like to be in the public eye today\nUnless you're in it [noise] it's very easy to sit in your house and listen to me or listen to someone else and have your own opinion and God Bless you for listening to the show but when you were on the front lines in the nation right now\nYou don't know what hatred is out there like I Do and the range mentality of these liberal progressive so it's something\nTo behold [noise]\nJoy the Savage Nation cold feet by ... four hundred and Seventy five a four hundred and seven to eight to [noise]\n\nFor many years I've been wanting to Savage Nation about a secret war on cash by big government and big tech to steal both your money and your privacy well recent reports confirm that this war is expanding like wildfire and time is running out to take action would you please not become the next victim in this battle\nPlease discover how to win the war to destroy your harder and savings\nMy good friends that switched America have detailed all the dirty little government secrets and there are updated report\nBut it's free it's called the secret war on cash\nPart too it's available now by calling the eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six but it's important to report the secret war on cash this documents real life events such as banks refusing to cash checks cash being confiscated from innocent citizens\nThe Israelis know 'em right\nMany many people have known I'm right with the churches in America many churches and are protected by armed guards but to a progressive the idea of using a policeman\nAn off duty policeman or an armed guard is such anathema they would rather see people defenseless them protected biggest they don't want to be seen as politically on the side of those of us who understand the power of protection of guns afford a ... show nuts\nSo those of us who understand the power of protection of guns afford a show none other than the lunatic of lunatics to blast ... in New York has the nerve to say no guns in needed listen to clip six and you'll hear the mind of a madman\nYou only have never allow the normalization of hate that's not what we will stand for and in that vein we have to say what was said yesterday I was also unacceptable no houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able to practice their religion that's not America\nYou know you are really stupid I'm coming to understand that there's actually no logical reason in the minds of a liberal waters normalization of hate have to do with protecting yourself in a synagogue or a church there is no connection between the two\nAnd I will say again there's only one solution to this protect yourself at all times because no one else will be that protects you\nKnow we can stance forward because I'm not ready to move up there yet I got too many hours to go you have to move up to it but at the end of this terrible tragedy where this this ah Nazis psychotic\nKilled on on defense was Jews who had nowhere to defend themselves it was the the police with guns Mr ... who went in and stop them it wasn't you with your mouse\nIt was cops with guns some of whom got shot shame on you to blast geo shame on you for the basing the police for doing this incredible job\nThey were the ones who tracked him to a little room where he was hiding and they were the ones who got this cowardly psychotic to throw as weapons now he's in a hospital somewhere being cared for don't you just love that\nLike the terrorists we've seen America after they kill people they're treated better than the people they shot what a wonderful country we live in but nevertheless I'm just a talk show host you're observing\nAnd trying to help you get through this day I Know many of you were waiting for my opinion I understand that I have a very loyal audience\nWho appreciates my view of things and so far I've given you several views of these things in one way or another but I'm not yet gotten to inside the mind of a psychopath\nI've also challenged you by saying do you believe that I'm correct that we need armed guards in houses of worship I mean it just such an obvious answer to the question what is the Blasio talking about what do you mean who's normalizing hate\nWas saying protect the people\nPut a policeman in engine that what we do with schools now remember what happened in Florida with that cowardly cop who hid behind those pillars remember him he was actually in the school to protect the children when that guy came up with a gun was hiding behind the pillows he's collecting a bench and now\nThe cop should be a president who ran away these cop should be invited to the White House which they will be\nOne of them are still in the hospital because he took bullet wounds in the hands thank God none of them were killed but some of them was severely injured because unlike the blast year they knew they knew that one thing guns save lives guns save lives guns save lives\nIt's a great group called juice for the protection of firearms ownership they know all about this\nAnd so I Want to play for you this sounds at this moment of the scanner audio at the end of this is the one at the end I don't want the one of the beginning we have the scanner audio the cops going in police played that one listen to this\n[noise]\n\n\n\nFor [laughter] for [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd they are the clock clock [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nWell that's the police scanner as they went in to take down the Nazi or after he killed all those innocent people but as you could see they went in with guns drawn\nNot with the white flag they weren't waving the French flag when they went in these are heavily armed ... highly trained extremely brave men who went in there it wasn't a bunch of liberals going in waving Mr Roger's neighborhood in book form\nAnd asking him to please join them for a a a a a snack they were ready to shoot and they got shot some of them guns can save lives\nAnd in New York by the way or the NYPD was sent to protect mosques I don't know if you know that the same ... Hussein guns and never the answer\nWe don't have to have armed guards to practice their religion why did he sent the armed guards to mosques anyone have an answer to that because he's a liar hypocrite period he's a ... he's a bombings a mutt\nEnjoy those Savage Nation coal no eight by four hundred and Seventy eight by bugs for number seven to eight to some of\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future coal eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or switched America dot com here's the truth about most home security companies well they're like dealing with another bad you know old fashioned cable company\nYou're going to spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when that you're a breaking point you remember I'm locked in a three year contract with these people that look if you look at a protect your home go with simply safe home security why\nSimply safe is real comprehensive protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using it makes your home is actually much safer\nThe protection beautifully designed looks good on your home using it makes your home is actually much safer simply say patch back up some place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power into that or some of the tax system best of all you get twenty four seven monitoring with police and fire dispatch\nFor just Fifteen dollars a month and unlike other\nSimply safe has no long term contract it's the best around the clock protection you could find it the best price get free shipping and free returns at simply safes average dot com now go to simply safes average dot com\nHello I'm Ted Yoho and I'm your congressman Florida's third congressional district I'm asking for your support and your vote in this upcoming November ... election let me tell you why in the past two years we've cut taxes in reduced regulations creating the best academy in decades today we have the lowest unemployment\nIn recent history across tall demographic a stronger economy means a stronger job market and that means higher wages increased benefits and better opportunity more importantly we're improving education for all of our children\nWhether it's in medicine high tax them in the arts for high paying trade jobs were making sure that every child is educated today for the jobs of tomorrow\nWe want to make sure our schools are safe so children can learn free of fear [noise] that's why we provided funding for mental health counseling and enhanced security on campuses across or district now is the time to continue this focus on growing our economy helping our children achieve their fullest potential let's keep the future bright visit\nTed Yoho dot com and please vote on November six I'm Ted Yoho and I approve this message [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to net is share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nIn the global investment management businesses retention financial they\nLearned more in the G.

there have always been white nationalist in this country many of them died in World War two\nOh yes they mean a lot of white nationalist in America look at some of the revolutionary war cemeteries Oh
