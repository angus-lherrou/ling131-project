book you can read it yourself or maybe we'll talk about it tomorrow\nOr it's the most important political book of our time I'll leave it at that but I Want to do is take some of your calls and I would like to reference an article written by Cindy gross and the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs\nAnd I'll Try to stay away from the obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage is also a fortune teller brilliant wanted that who else of Michael Savage would released a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation it's nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd that she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to prove it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by sentence the politicians without carrier motives\n[noise] Savage provides vital context for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects and the tactics of the puppet masters who do gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine\nShe then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times or Israel she's very Jewish\nAnd she asked me a key question which was funny\nWhich was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out and in quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power madness of the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ... [noise]\nOf course we discuss the cabin on stereos\nAnd he said the check off to smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married and Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish Blumenthal Blumenthal Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss are Leo Frank cases Savage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming capital I thought that was the most salient point of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics\nThe exact opposite of what took place during the process of governing cabinet and what was sad about it was that there were Jewish people violating the ethics of their fathers\nBlumenthal amongst them Blumenthal in others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day that Hillary isn't in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages his opposition to read the book and debate him\nAnd of course my discussion with Savage including where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains and as involvement with about\n... it was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects are going to be seen for years and years to come but let's get back to the news of the day\nAnd my opinion on it I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resigned suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed again Trump to bomb Syria\nNow on what do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning\nShe was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ambassador as opposed to big unabashed that are supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag they're about to release gas and say that I saw that it I pointed out over and over again aside would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they've got ISIS backed in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it [noise] and somehow people within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drum for the launch of Tomahawk against Syria\nWell it was miss the most jazz trio himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that in the ... plant\nUh in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war and the worst way they would bloodthirsty and they wanted war but for some reason the non global is around from\nWar of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well as a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me\nAnd that we're talking about my book stop mass

bigotry have to defining parts immorality and their legality the\nProblem for progressive is is that the first is subjective and often clashes with the ladder for example the bakery that refuses to make a cake for gay couple\nWent any entrenched group feels threatened by a newly formed identity be they marry gays free blacks or transplanted Hispanics who don't necessarily speak the language hysteria on the local and national level is invariably that result\nHow that is manifest whether by the formation of the Ku Klux Klan massive deportations depends entirely on the wisdom and broad based are passionate about leaders that you'll notice in that paragraph that's not really exactly a right wing position is\nKnown as some of the other things and and that's what I Love about you by the way is that you don't do what the mass hysteria by the way sometimes on both sides do and that is his group think enough of that already we look at each issue independently it doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or Republican and it's so refreshing that that you do that\nWell first of all I'm an older American male number two I'm from a social worker\nI'm the son of an immigrant actually to immigrants so I grew up with one foot in the old world one foot in the new tend to see things in a multiplicity of ways or through a ... of the ways and I want I Want to close with one line that actually had the book closes with a line that I Hope\nWill be some benefit to America I kinda doubt it and I write this I say in one of his many it was it plays on words Benjamin Franklin set of Americans just before you fix the signature on a declaration of independence we must indeed all hang together what most surely we should hang separately does that not apply today\nAnd applies exactly to what has been happening not just with Kavanaugh in this case but with all of these smears against\nUm you you against other people in the media and it can absolutely go if if for example the me too movement can also be used against Democrats of people are going to sit there and use it as a\nPolitical weapon and so it looks like the pendulum swing way too far and you're pointing out that this mass hysteria and again in at the end of the day comes for everybody if that's what you if that had a revolution that's right that they're pushing you\nSeen as a Thursday blade it has no political affiliation and when the left starts dropping it on the right and then the women started dropping another man they don't understand what will happen next study any revolution whether it be a lot of mouths China Soviet revolution Bolshevik rather\nOr um Castro's Cuba after they got to killing their enemies they started killing each other struggling for power\nAnd so you know Aaron when the left has removed all the statues of Columbus as they want to do in New York\nAll the Confederate flags all the monuments to our founding fathers when books like mine have been burned and removed from libraries when we have allowed hysterical cries to terminate or terrorize rational discourse\nAs I write we will all I've become a cop and made their son ... and those who are wrecked a testament to their own intimate with the bones of others I Would I mean by that is we're all potential victims of hysteria\nDoesn't matter what side you're on and what I'm suggesting to people listen to this broadcast and read stop mass hysteria take a deep breath before you vilify your enemy biggest tomorrow it may be you\nAnd learn what is happening in society today and the way that you can do that is is by the book stop mass hysteria America's insanity from the sand on which trials to the Trump witch hunts available at Amazon bookstores on Tuesday and Michael Savage thank you so much for being

running of Newsmax stood by me stood by the movements that by the message\nBut I Want to say to you that you cannot be consistently vigilant if you're hysterical mass hysteria permits you to go along with the unlawful incarceration of people sometimes as was done with the law the unlawful incarceration of Japanese by FDR\nWhich is why it had to be done quickly you see hysteria subsides and passions and as the enemy vanishes if the government had allowed its citizens to become rabbit about Germans instead of Nazis\n[noise] uh I I meant instead of a Japanese we would have turned on ... on Dutch were Hungarians or polls\nIn much the same way that Sikhs were targeted as Muslims after nine eleven\nBecause hysterics confused the turbans with the Muslim had dress and that's from page to hundreds of a stop mass hysteria that's for those of you who are skeptical of me and don't really know who you're dealing with and like to categorize me is what I Am not\nI'm taking you on an unprecedented Journey Through long history of mass hysteria United States and I come to conclusions you would never ever predict if you want to just a predict in advance through your prejudice\nThey're just a predict in advance through your prejudice\nSo that's what I told you and I think we need to go on though because what we're witnessing in this country is unprecedented in almost every way\nI'd like to believe we've seen that before and perhaps we have with the red scare and in a few other times uh the war of the world's by Austin wells hysteria\nBut what we're seeing now where you have the pillow sees and the fines things using the propaganda tactics of Joseph ... to whip up the masses against their target demographic meaning the heterosexual Christian white male this is something new in history\nTo presume an individual is guilty in advance is something new in American history and by the way these women did this\nTo Capitol in this case with impunity\nUs far there's been no call to central Dianne Feinstein\nOr Blumenthal or the other end cause it to us that's far there's been no call to say turnabout fair play we're going to demand that FBI investigation of all of the senators to see what's skeletons they may have in their closet because you see my friends once you reach a certain level in American society that is US Senate you are above the law\nAnd

really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we I've seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday

traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white\nA Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had anti whites in the

Francisco and in Portland and in Seattle and an other dozens of extreme left ... that is spreading like a cancer\nBecause of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes they're communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been a fuel for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's University of California Berkeley thank you are in a commencement speech three years ago said we are all just ruptures\nShe encouraged people to go in the streets in cause chaos to block traffic\nWhat does she think what happened or about Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those in the far to beat up Republicans harassed

accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city of my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with Trump witch hunt has now spread to anyone they disagree with so of course there's no ties to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there's no history and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was no witch hunt against Kavanaugh he wasn't ... not up for all white\nMale heterosexual Christians was of course he was well that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very hysterical times and very dangerously hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car\nAnd too many houses no what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late\nAnd so I'm asking you to Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be in Walmart and Sam's itching bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchased to be on a new release table between the knights of October which is today in the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on a new release table show it's up to you to go there and demanded the book the put where the publisher\nOf paid for it to me for it because it's probably the most important both of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me about ... are more important book how me which is more important right now is I don't know of one\nAnd so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with the\nMany of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have

book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon the you and for me for that matter Governor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed him and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally large audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot\nWherever it is seen now last year Governor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on his show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God's sake and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email account joined me because she's prepping U.S House for the hurricane he's in the panhandle of Florida\nBut he's going to join us tomorrow granted his phone's not out from the storm and try to reach us either on a landline or on a cell phone again we want to thank Governor Huckabee for standing with the American people in these dark times especially in these times of media blackouts and remember he's been\nHis himself has been a ... a blacklisted by many many in the media and written off\nAnd he rose from the ashes like a Phoenix as I Hope we will do as well on the Savage Nation\nAnd there is no hysteria out there and none whatsoever the Washington Post says it's not historical or Marlboro not at all judicious timing I Would say well I Would say so many of my lawyer listeners understand uh the timing of mass hysteria is perfect right now and we're talking about that [noise]\nBut we're talking about the news in the day so Haley resigns and immediately later in the afternoon I mean right now we hear the Trump is floating the idea of a Goldman Sachs banker unnamed Dina Powell to be the new UN ambassador\nYou say well what's wrong with that\nDidn't we elect Donald Trump to clean the swamp didn't we elect Donald Trump\nTo not be a global is to not appoint global is to high places I seem to recall that was his campaign slogan\nRight nationalism America First can you explain to me how Goldman Sachs and a woman who works for Goldman Sachs representing us in the UN is America First can I explain that to me do you think that threatening war with Syria or Russia\nPuts America First I don't think so and as I said to you and the reason in my opinion that Haley suddenly resigned is because she failed to ignite a war with Russia by bombing Syria about four or five weeks ago when she was beating the war drums I don't know if you remember her speeches one bellicose speech after another\nAnd threatening one day after the other\nSo here we are now they're saying oh well maybe we'll put Goldman Sachs is Dina Powell and they have to replace Haley to me it confirms everything I've been saying now she worked for this government she was working in the administration and she left\nAnd it says Dina has done a great job for the minister action has been a valued member of the Israeli Palestinian peace team well here's your problem\nHere is your problem\nAnd at the risk of igniting the write\nIn directions I Do not want to ignite the right\nI Will leave out my belief as to who is pulling the switches on this particular situation in the United nations you can't really blame them\nI mean if you were the tail and you continue to wag the dog for so many years and suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry\nTail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News view or what do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and\nTo attack Syria and Russia\nLook it's a very complicated game the middle east and you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit there and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out is because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would have drag us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all I mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist happens I'm twelve years old\nAnd a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east is time they use that instead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring
