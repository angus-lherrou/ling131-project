New York junk of her lobbying for stuff front of the government that was like a thousand dollar luxury stay you know at this at this bill again that violate the law as well but the real problem with it is\nThose same lobbyists who arranged in New York drunk at the same lobbyists who did the Costa Rica bill are they're benefiting injury they're basically putting money in his pockets where did he do as mayor he turned around and gave the same people ate two million dollar contract to build a restaurant with taxpayer\nDollars\nSo what else to be hiding from the people of Florida then they end\nUp doing stop stop did they end up doing more travel that was paid for by lobbyists he's in under ethics investigation by the Florida ethics commission why not wave confidentiality so we can get all these documents out in the public so that the voters know what's out there [noise]\nBut it's bad is is that it is and I think it is bad because you know we want we don't want to elect\nA corrupt mayor to be governor of Florida it's just not what you want\n'em but it's bad is that is\nYou know his agenda for Florida it's probably even worse if you look at what he wants to do we have a great economic recovery going you know the momentum is on Florida side we have people looking to invest in Florida every single day but they do that because they know Florida has had good policies with low taxes\nShe's been a friend of mine she is a really an example of a strong accomplished conservative woman and she was the first woman to successfully manage a presidential election when President Trump was elected and ah she is one of\nThe the strongest I'm the most principled folks we have on our side of the aisle\nAnd I did but I think we should give a great northeast Florida welcome to Kellyanne Conway\n[noise]\nSame here and time kid Donald Trump and Mike ... been here in town\nWow mine just can't even talk more than I Do and that's saying a lot [noise]\nWe're going to shrink my introduction but I'm here for three reasons one is to tell you earlier today had the privilege of being in the panhandle with Governor Rick Scott in which they\nCongressmen and this is Don and of course are great vice president and wonderful second lady Mike in Karen ... song\nAnd I said you know we'll talk to you about this ... saw firsthand great bravery that continue going to be daily and Kennedy Connery and the restoration\nOf that area and with your coast guard with the national guard and all the wonderful volunteers\nReal privilege for me to be there and can do air force base to hear the stories so as the president can manage a week or so ago the vice president said today\nThis administration remains with the people in Florida and we will be there every Saturday ranging the bill Murray store I'm here for another reason in my personal\nCapacity and Kellyanne Conway managed to tell you that Ron dissenters should be the next governor of the great state of\n[noise]\nJeanette and you should be your next we've got [noise]\nPlenty myself where your next governor and the\n\nSome ... years ago elections have consequences [noise] being consequences for the judiciary than consequences for legislation they've ...\nSherry they have consequences for legislation they've consequences for free markets and indeed have consequences for a great military and our veterans and they have consequences for freedom itself\nElections are fundamentally about choices and as I look across in my personal capacity across the political landscape this year a different races\nI think very few where there's such a stark contrast in the policy positions and division that is being put forth by the two candidates as a senior governor's race this year to you have a choice to make\nYou can go with Rhonda Santas who will be a reliable vote for the kind of tax cuts relief and deregulation and renegotiate trade deals\nThat no longer make us apologize for America but help America America workers in American edgy stand tall and rejuvenating we have a net gain net new jobs in manufacturing in construction in mining\nReally just remarkable what's happening all across the country this economic boom boom unemployment nationwide under four percent growth has been over four percent\nBlue collar wages rising wages overall rising in a way not since we put man on the moon many many decades ago the optimism is higher consumer optimism small business confidence manufacturing confidence\nAre small business owners tell us we were contract thing we were going to close up shop literally and now we're expanding\nLadies and gentlemen around Assange is a reliable vote to keep that economic boom going here in the great state of Florida his [noise]\nHis opponent last tax hikes\nHis opponent wants to tax corporations hire and the tax cutting JOBS Act that had congressman ... vote\nThat provided relief for businesses in our employers in a way that took us from the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world at thirty five percent to Twenty one percent beneath the average of twenty three percent of what has that done that has led to eight million Americans receiving bonuses or raises are both\nNancy ... [noise]\nNot crumbs that's real bread\nRepatriating trillions of dollars that it's been parked legally overseas\n[noise] if you voted against and you are against as a democratic candidate for governor is against if you're against those kinds of tax cuts then you're against the twenty thousand new jobs that apple is said they're bringing to the U.S you're against all those games in the trades and in the industries that were flat on their backs that the candidates\nLikely democratic candidate for governor has set in the past\nAh these in the Democratic candidate for two thousand sixteenth president name I never say any more or less ... less I'd be accused of cells and her name her she promised to put these industries out of business and they are thriving and they are growing with American workers\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen [noise]\nNo no no no no no no no no but I Do want to talk about law enforcement [noise]\nI Want to talk about\nThe contrast with respect to law enforcement this is very important\nFor you to here we have an Iraq War veteran former federal prosecutor who backs the blue\nWho says to our law enforcement her first responded our military veterans much like our president does enter vice president says we've got you you are more deeply respected and better resourced because these men hold office and because that men would be your governor law enforcement\nNeeds to have the tools and the respect they need and that includes our customs and border protection that includes ice the idea that you would abolish ice who stops child smuggling\nWho just last year interdict it enough fencing all to have killed every man woman and child in this country to every single day puts their lives and their safety on the line so that we may be free\nAnd that anti law enforcement rhetoric is very very dangerous and it's very very unfortunate I vote for Ron ... is a vote\nFor law enforcement [noise]\nAny\nSeniors out there I'm a junior senior any senior that their\nMedicare for all is less Medicare for you and goes spread the word it sounds really great but a single payer system eight and a half years after Obamacare left to twenty million Americans of that any type of health insurance a single payer system masquerading as something called Medicare for all means less Medicare for you\nAnd a lot less freedom in health care for everyone else now I've read that the Democratic candidate for governor has said a lot of stuff but one thing that really strikes me is this embrace of people like Bernie Sanders and ideas that are\nAbout socialism [noise]\nI think that's very unfortunate\nBecause socialism hasn't worked in the countries that have tried it and in fact we this very generous country has received so many people\nFrom those countries were socialism has failed welcome them in here to our society we're free markets in freedom reign where the land of the free in the home of the brave in large part because of\nOur free market system and our beliefs and freedom and free will\nNow I don't know who's in charge of the Democratic party these days I Can't figure it out I don't know if it's a twenty eight year old socialist from New York I don't know if it's a Seventy something socialist who was here endorsing a candidate but I Do know the policies are wrong the policies are wrong for Florida\nThe third reason I'm here well let me finish with this you got to get people out to vote since I'm here in my personal capacity is Kellyanne Conway did you hear that back there I don't I don't yes [noise]\nTo get people to vote if your friends your neighbors [noise]\nAnd your loved ones are saying well I hate politics you know what you should say to them I don't blame you I can understand why you feel that way\nBut this is not about politics this is about freedom this is about policy this is about the future of Florida is not about politics\n[noise] politics if it means to an end [noise] so you\nHand uh Seventy second immersion and a seven\nMinute version why I'm voting for Ron disadvantaged and Jeannette in unions and Rick Scott Y. on voting Republican why that is right freedom tell them why it is tell them why you're doing that\nI Wonder if they actually meet somewhere at some kind of dark restaurants\nHave some kind of meeting I mean if I'm One of his the dark corners of the of the media and a right wing or as they say that I should think that there's a secret meeting of a cabal of Obama Clinton a dealer and all of the left and they meet somewhere I don't believe they actually meet somewhere\nTrump supporters chant lock her up the same ... percent the pipes on okay Newsweek conservative commentators Michael ... New York magazine who's ignored me for twenty five years even though I'm On a New York and they are you know most of the people who write for New York magazine already with from New York\nThat's the irony I actually was born in how many people who ride from New York magazine are actually born in New York I don't know they're probably from somewhere else I Would think\nSo now New York magazine or you know they weren't that big of a prominent conservatives think the bomb scares are liberal hoax so that's almost neutral and in the way they did it\nIn the Newsweek says Michael Savage the conservative host at least at least they're polite about it and reasonably calling me the conservative host thank you of the radio Savage which has an audience of millions every which is all true\nBut at least they would dignified in their attacks Newsweek I got to give it to them\nNew York Mac prominent conservatives think the bomb scares are liberal oaks somewhat that's dignified prominent conservatives you got that right but please call me Dr Savage you when you refer to make because if you called that fraud Dr Ford doctor every minute with such a\nSuch sacred tone stock afford this doctor for that you think she was bigger than Dr Freud Dr Ford Dr Ford said this Dr Ford said that since a PHD that's real which I have from a great university greater than hers by the way and my publications great out\nJust great out distance anything that Dr fraud published please refer to me is Dr Savage now since you not recognize that th they use a high value and it also adds a certain lure of respectability to me\nTo call me whatever you want make sure your call me Dr Savage do whatever you do to be fair now since you believe so much in the doctor business\nBut the main thing is you don't even have to call me that it's just trying to analyze what I'm saying for the sake of the nation do you actually think it's unreasonable to be skeptical about these things in your heart of hearts are you not skeptical yourself\nAll you people who writes for New York magazine the Daily Beast come on when you're alone by yourself in the toilet\nIn the darkest moments of your upper alone this at night when you see you have no friends because of your main main list and you're horrible politics after all the paid volunteers have gone home when you're alone and you wonder where you went wrong in life you have no wives no husbands no children\nAnd you ask yourself all that sex and the children where to go wrong\nThat's the one line I Love that's my favorite line by the way to the deviant suit to try to attack me they think they can get to me I look at them and they say ... all that section of children they don't have an answer for that one\nBecause that's the way of life that's the normal way of life for that has been from the beginning of time and it will be until the end of time which is children children it's all about the children and what I Love his all those are talking about the children most don't even have any they generally have no children\nThey all look like Donna Shalala I don't understand that the ones who are most interested in children have not how does that work\nWhy are they qualify they would talk about ... children if they never raised on what do they know about raising a child labor stayed up night with a child with the flu and lost sleep\nHave they ever gone to school with a child who couldn't do math to him because they were so distracted and put aside their own self interests have they ever gone to plays they didn't want to sit through for the children are based on soccer fields and the cold to cheer on their son no but they're all experts on raising children isn't that interesting and\nThose of us who actually raise children are in the year that as breeders by these wonderful people who have taken over our society you see what I'm saying at least that's how I see it and I just don't buy this right now this little particular\nCharade I I don't doubt that tomorrow the next day they'll dig summing up I have a trailer park\nAnd then there'll be a Jack Ruby right afterwards first do get to Lee Harvey Oswald\nIn the Ku Klux Klan outfit or the or at our eye out for whatever the Saudi ... outfit like I Would say camouflage jacket with a Trump a sticker on a Trump flag or something a Trump pat the ultimate a villain the it would be somebody with a ... hat\nAnd enter a sticker on a camouflage jacket with a Confederate flag or shown on it right holding a copy of stop mass hysteria saying he's a member of the ...\nThe perfect the perfect villain marched out and then they'll have a script in his hand it gets some out of a prison the Tallahassee or Georgia I don't know and they'll offer him like let's say you have free healthcare for his family for three generations of feel like the fall\nAnd maybe a you know some money thrown in with one way trip to the Virgin Islands on a silly and fishing boat and then they'll say you declare yes I got all my ideas from talk radio I listen to talk radio and I know that all these people are evil trying to destroy America the new world orders\nThat's why I did it that can happen and if it happens similar\nAnd that's why I did it that could happen\nAnd if it happens civil liberties it that's all\nWhat am I going to do I don't know what tomorrow will bring\nAll I can do is take it one day at a time and use the powers of raising the God gave me and it's not yet taken away from me back yesterday wondering I don't know I Can't quote the person but yesterday I went to the ... radio studios in San Francisco where I started ... be five years ago\nIn March and I was actually early than out of the march fourth in two thousand in the Nineteen Ninety four was my first show but I went in there\nAnd it was like twenty five years went by and the blink of an eye sweaty it's amazing just what your grandmother set the you or your father time goes by so quickly and it does\nDo you know that I've been on the radio for a quarter of a century and these very same forces that an out destroying America tried have tried to destroy me for a quarter of a century they've used every trick in the book they've taken me off stations they've tried to get it was slander me\nThey've used media matters to try to get my advertisers to run away and they've succeeded at that and yet somehow I'm Still here\nI won't be forever come January you won't be able to hear me in certain markets because they've succeeded politically in removing the most independent conservative voice in the country but I still will be heard across America a on some stations for an hour or two and also on on whatever they call it pod casting which will be an original podcast\nSo you know there's a funny thing today they can only control so much for so long and and now that they've lost control of the narrative itself\nI think they're trying to take control of a new narrative\nIn my opinion that's what they're doing here\nThey've already distorted America's view of the population\nThere making you think that a good percentage of the population is gay or lesbian or transsexual in fact the healthiest part part of society or gay lesbian or transsexual that's what they want you to believe\nAnd so you'll just is not to be about to read to you\nBroadcast TV hits record percentage of algae

show Savage Nation which has an audience of millions every week claimed quote there was a high probability\nThat the whole thing had been set up as a false flag to gain sympathy for the Democrats number one and number two to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border closed quote media matters reported now you have to understand media matters is a wholly owned subsidiary of George Soros his operation the funds them\nSo they are as PR team media matters for Twenty years is attacked me\nSo it's like George Soros reporter when challenged by a caller who said savages comments were so far off the edge of it is they're responsible Savage replied because you say it's a responsible doesn't make it a responsible it means you're not able to think outside your own bucks\nAll your fear buttons have been hit\nThat's exactly what you saw some company want you to feel\nI Am saying question authority close quote another reason this is so important is because my logic and my statement is far less it's that simple New York magazine which has ignored me for the last twenty five years making believe a a I Am not from New York originally I don't have the most powerful radio show in New York talk which I Do\nEven they are but not me but not anymore it's just prominent conservatives think the bomb scares or a liberal hopes and again again I have to say if I'm not for myself who will be\nIf I'm only for myself who am I\nAnd they quote me again liberals did it because they're trying to distract people from my ... my grand caravan\nGenerally right wing radio host Michael Savage outright declared quote it say high probability that the whole thing is set up as a false flag to game sympathy for the Democrats and to get our minds off the hordes of illegal aliens approach you got southern border now\nI wake up today and I see that Andy blooper perhaps the most vacuous person in the history of the media they gave him a pair of clear eyeglasses to make it look like an intellect\nAndy blooper on CNN says he's no longer going to show pictures of the hordes of illegal aliens approaching our southern border to invade this nation for the free things he said no we're not going to do that anymore because they're not a threat to the nation Andy why don't you take a few into your apartment\nWhy don't you put your money where your mouth is and take a few of them in and then I'll believe award you say\nNow here's the guardian us rights ... book demand George sauce faces attacks rooted in anti Semitism right on time anyone who attacks George sauces and anti Semite\nNow I find that bubbly offensive for three different reasons even though I say W offensive it's actually\nTraveling offensive they say that anyone who attacks George Soros is doing it because they're anti Semite let me deal with that for a minute I'm probably more Jewish than George Soros that's number one and if you're going to tell me as a person of the Jewish faith is not allowed to criticize another person to the Jewish faith without being called an anti Semite I Will say to you go to hell\nHouse that George Soros is the most disruptive individual in the history of the American political system nobody has ever spent more money to disrupt more events than this man he has funded ...\nYou know the good folks have been beating people up and attacking police George Soros funds them black lives matter don't tell me they're not a domestic terrorist group because I disagree with you that's my opinion what because as the word black and I can't say that they are violence is something I should ignore [noise] sorry I see him\nAnd I call them as I see them [noise]\nSo [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety med everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe a bit Porgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about two hundred bucks a month\nCalled term providers speak with big Lou and eight hundred and five one one thirty five thirty five big we will find a term life policy for you even if you have type two diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure term providers helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life insurance\nTo buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is call big Lou an eight hundred five on one thirty five thirty five Lew will make sure the scale they're taped in your favor\nSo went to a male facility and whoever this moron is who's doing this didn't know that it would be intercepted so therefore he wanted it intercepted right didn't he focusing on leads the Pakistan for far as the FBI tries to do what part of the Bible and Burr pictured above the pipe bomb sent the CNN's newsroom [noise]\nI have a couple of questions that I'll raise again\nWhy does CNN ... wire CNN one not released surveillance footage of the individual\nWho sent it there it wasn't mailed because there was no stamp ... know cancellation on the stamps\nSo someone had to live with it like a messenger okay maybe a messenger so let me see the messenger that's number two number three why did see in an open the package if it was suspicious without calling or New York city bomb squad wise like you get it on the evening news\nSo now we've got to play some sound here's Maxine Waters one of the worst haters in America today claiming she's not scared let's hear a standing up now out of uh the new show the new show wished the newest show and tell us your old to\n... to the point where we are the polls were protesting the death do us a little ... why can't\nI Can't stomach gr she incited violence in this country I Want you to play a clip for so this has never forgotten what this woman actually has done to this country listen to oh for\nSure we\n\nOh we're not welcome in my own country you think I'm going to run away from some leftist who's going to scare me get mistaken most of us are already put to pretend to defend ourselves Maxine so all you're doing is provoking civil war you a loud mouth phony you do stand up there like you were a lady of peace and you're not scared you\nDon't want to started this whole damn thing by telling people to attack us now you're making believe you didn't do it unfortunately feel Maxine Waters the south exists then you have the media government complex you got the the evacuation Andy Cooper and the bloopers I affectionately call him\nSaying he's no longer showing any video of the army of invaders coming from Honduras so they've already gotten from central a casting what to do they're not showing you anymore they marching army listen to oh five years Andy blooper\nAnd this isn't about the merits of this or that immigration policy only about\nMaking arguments based on facts not shut up which is also why again tonight we're not showing wall to wall video of that ... or whatever I think about the people in it you know have it and they are and the minister ration is ingesting some kind of invading army infiltrate and potentially by terrorists looming on the U.S border\nHow does a man of such\nI Would say low IQ get so far on CNN\nI mean this man obviously was not that bright you can see that he's not smart you know I don't want to go into the light bulb analogy we know darn lemons um let's say utility bolt as I've said before because it's a good analogy that's something anyone can understand if you go to a store to buy light bulbs you can get different water just\nDon't normally would get us what what do what you normally use a Seventy a hundred in the house of sixty I don't know what we use today they changed the water's edge when I was a kid there was like a certain amount it's all different I Can't follow it I remember my house we had lamps a fifty a hundred a hundred and fifty was a three way but the general light bulb was sixty water\nRight now if you look in a light bulb section of a like a Home Depot\nRight you've got to write about it so then there's always the utility ball that's the small bubbles very them\nSo I Would say Andy Cooper is one around above Don Lemon if there's a light bulb a little hot little bright and the burns a little brighter than the unlimited the lowest end of the ... of the ... spectrum it would be anti coup but then they give them an I ... a skinny suit\nAnd a pair of glasses that are not even prescription they're clearly last just to make them look smarter\nThat that's anti Cooper sums up to believe he's not running of pictures of the of the thing because the guy who runs seeing and told them not to run it anymore [noise]\nUh you know I Know why you're listening to the show it was like I'm cynical number one but I'm also able to look look through things you know express what you wish you could say work but there's ... we're more frightened to speak in this country than they were in the Soviet Union\nI've told you that people are terrified to speak out so I you know you live you know I speak for all of you I Know I Do I really do I know people say without you wouldn't know what to do you'd almost like the last of the Mohicans out there\nThe other skate around the topic talk around the topic will you actually say what we think\nWell that's right so I keep saying keep trying to say it like it is and most Democrats behind the scenes think the same way either by the way and suddenly they don't want their country overrun they don't want to pay higher taxes they don't like the bums in the streets anymore than anyone else does but they won't say it\nSo I'm like the uncle in the family that they like to go and visit once in a while there was no uncle left anymore there's no you know there's no uncle anymore in America uncle uncle Joe was gone\n[noise] I like to be in America everything free in America a well known as a price for everything [noise] so here we go [noise] the marches on eighty eight eighty how many troops that he sent down there eight hundred\nNow how eight hundred troops going to stop this mob from breaking into America how is it possible\nI'm become a Muslim session need O'Connor or that loser is in the getting the news ...

D is this how could a person who was never really a Catholic to begin with suddenly love Islam tell me what it is about Islam that would want that somebody who is the capital why would they want to become Muslim what what's in it for them so they could mistreated by the men\nWait a minute let me let me put into it again the women who are feminists who say men are pigs and men miss treat them want to become a Muslim for what reason because women are treated so well by Muslims in which country which Muslim country did I miss a God just so stupid we do this for a living\nSo the bottom line is this something it'll be on the News Tomorrow is that going to hold up another day\nThan the euro got ones um deniro you dumb\nYou ... ... ... a month a mutt a mutt um about\nReagan Kelly got thrown out well she's still like sixty nine billion dollars you hear this Megan Kelly out because she said something I don't even know she said black face I don't even I didn't follow the story defending blacks I don't know what she said\nAfter she defended blackface on Tuesday showed apologized I don't even know what she did I was never a fan of her as I thought she was over over rated and overpaid that's a big number sixty million dollar contract the heavy duty number\nBut that's what is she going to look at a face our ah she'll look good anymore man that she put on weight she looks like Rosie O'Donnell after a diet\nIf you look at making Kelly's face look at that she's become both vine oh no no I'm not putting anyone down it was a little extra weight on their body but this woman was stoned or just a number of years ago this woman looks like she works at a bowling alley no nothing against bowling alleys but\nIf she was behind the counter giving out shoes that smelled and a bowling alley would you be surprised that a year or two she could open the the Kelly lanes that's a nice thing to do with Kelly lanes should have like a whole chain a chain of Kelly lanes oh she's become a little hefty to\nKelly was spotted in public on Wednesday returning home to her Upper West somewhere else apartments ship you're outcast if she stared at our phone\nWhat's with the skinny pants and everyone and don't you love the body guards everywhere all of these lives all our body guards all these lovers of peace and humanity\nWalk in the classic rag and bones shoes like make oh that's disgusting so if some news woman whereas a shoe they didn't sell it under the look what the newspapers have become\nThey show a walking in a kind of shoot she's wearing and there's an ad for the shoe underneath [laughter] you can store you better I Swear to God\nWalk in the shoes that may get his wearing four hundred and Ninety five dollars for a pair of shoes I never paid for the Ninety five dollars for a pair of shoes in my entire life ever there's no need for that you could buy a good pair of shoes today for Deuce top\n... my running short a time I'll be back in a minute\nSavage\n\nDoes your dog age scratch danker shed like crazy come to die to buy for help order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor jobs get the third bottle free\nNew improved liquor jobs with the mega six omega three vitamin E. and now it's six extra direct fed micro deals even better for the digestive tract and immune system and dogs ... try liquor jobs by to get one free this is Henry look authentic provided by", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "25"}
