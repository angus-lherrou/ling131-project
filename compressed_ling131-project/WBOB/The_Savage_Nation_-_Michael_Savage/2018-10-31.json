point from the hatred towards white people\nYes yes and he doesn't understand it and it's like why do you want a blessed to be a white person and again you can say he's biracial he's half Hispanic and half white but he doesn't understand that's all he wanted people to do what they're supposed to do\nAnd when you can't tell me on the air what your husband's says but I think you're implying he's reaching a point of exploding isn't that what you're saying\nYes he is and he's he's in his retirement years he teaches firearms training and people are becoming are getting to the point where they're feeling that they're they're ... has to be defended just to go out and just to go onto the street anymore he's feeling that he's becoming a target when he is\nWell I I understand that very well and here's I understand I Lived like that for twenty five years it's the talk shows was received death threats for the day I started on ... you think it's easy not what you're saying now which is now gotten so generic it's against all white males know\nAbsolutely and and thank goodness there's a there's a platform for people to release their their anger\nAnd and again you get to the point what are you going to do about it I mean what what can we do I appreciate you telling us what can the boycott everybody and their brother were trying to vote\nNo no that doesn't work they wouldn't do anything

prejudice white men are only out for themselves [noise] he um he's just kind of add a lot for this and he he doesn't feel\n... water as he said to you in the privacy of your home that you can share with us that you feel is is a violence ... violence prone well\nAnd and like like with with my husband have basically everybody he knows he wants them to be proficient and firearms he feels he's going to get into a war not only for for going to get into a liberal versus conservative war\nSo he fears a political civil war yes yes yeah but it's it's breaking down on racial lines because of CNN\nYet it absolutely is that again that in in the broad picture my my husband my husband that's that's the bad thing about it my husband has and myself we have friends of all nationalities\nSo it it's almost it to that point are conservative friends that are black Hispanic Asian they feel the same way he does so he feels almost\nAs if they feel powerless when they let him were arriving maniac racist like
