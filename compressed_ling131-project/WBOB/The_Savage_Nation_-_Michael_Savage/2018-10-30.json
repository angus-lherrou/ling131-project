apparently they're not going to get through this country so he's into this country so easily and the rodeo that was expected around our polling places may not be conducted as the left one so they're slowing down\nAnd apparently they're being turned back some of going back on their own that's the good news\nAnd uh let's see what else was going on the uh Pittsburgh thing is not over with the president is arriving in Pittsburgh shortly\nAnd the left wing anti American creeps had the nerve to make believe than those Jews these left wing fanatics of this uh bend the arc group funded by Alexander ... speaks for all Jewish people in Pittsburgh or America it's\nSickening because it only stirs up anti Semitism because when you start to make believe that your small band of Marxist new world order one world order however you want to be the fine you anti Americans on the left\nYou make believe you speak for all Jewish people and you don't there are many many conservative Jewish people were never heard from by the government in the media and yet what you do by speaking for the Jewish people when you don't make you believe you do is you stir up anti Semitism\nAnd yet they want you to believe that all of Pittsburgh is Jewish community doesn't want Trump to the exact opposite is true\nAnd he's on the way there and I pray to God these left wing fanatics funded by Alexander Soros\nJust cooler today and don't make a mockery of yourselves and pretend that you speak for the Jews in Pittsburgh when you get there saying are not welcome I pray to God that you just for a few minutes have respect for the dead and don't use their dead bodies\nAs fuel for your horrendous agenda against the president and against most Americans by the way\nJust given a break for a day can you do that survivors huddle huddled in closet during synagogue attack terrible story I guess I should throw in what I said yesterday I spent three hours on this uh self defense self defense self defense cell defense\nChristians Jews must learn how to use the weapons they must learn to defend themselves I Know it's a shocking thing to say in a liberal democracy like ours although we're not that the notion while you would like not to be that kind of nation but we are\nYou need to learn to defend yourself the Israelis learn to they can't just be done with love they learn to have a ... in one hand and it was in the other that's why they develop the ... machine gun\nThey learn they needed a gun in one hand so the chief rabbi by the way of Israel was a paratrooper at the time remember that store he would parachute out of a a plane into a battle zone with a machine gun in his hand in a in the Bible and the other he learned he understood what it meant\nAnd so when we're going to learn I don't know when the average liberal in American comes to understand that someone else is not going to defend you you have to defend yourself\nMaybe they wouldn't have to huddle in the closet maybe they could learn that they have to defend themselves as terrible as that may sound and if they don't want to do it then they have to hire armed guards I've been trying on people about this was Nineteen eighty to eighty one\nIt's only a matter of time I said you just throwing the dice sitting there like just waiting for a maniac to come in\nAnd it's happened before in the past it was um Islamic fanatics who killed Jews mercilessly chopped them up and started them remember the Mumbai disaster you remember that one but because it was in India you know it came in when this one hit home because it was a white man who did it a craze Nazi type\nAnd so it fits the liberal agenda they've got someone to hate that they can hate with all their hearts when it was a Muslim who did it against the Jews they didn't fit the agenda that well and so they had to let it go a little bit they didn't focus so much on the perpetrators I mean is there is the uh the the the slaughter and the gay nightclub they didn't focus on it\nThe other slaughters they just always looked the other way because it doesn't fit the bill left wing agenda and it's not clear if you're looking at it with open eyes you know it's hard to have open eyes open heart with all these new stories and you take it and you do it for a living is very difficult I had a tough time over the weekend after this happened that hit me very close and very hard\nAnd I brought everything that I could to the table yesterday but today we're talking about something that's entirely different\nWhich is we're not talking about so much about the gangsters hidden in the in the in the women and children in a caravan of which we know there were several everyone knows that I mean if you were a if you or a gangster how would you come into the country you don't hide\nWhat would you walk in Santa gangster and I want to deal drugs in America\nYou get in line with that thousands of them with the women and children you have to push the carriages in front of you and you get the sympathy and the American people is all they're all just wanting to come in there all poor that's\nHow you would do it so it's slowing down on its own momentum is slowing down the momentum and that's because the president is speaking for most American people you may not notice forget the liars in the media who do this to incite hatred\nEvery poll one after the other no matter what the state shows that the largest majority of Americans even liberals do not want open borders they do not\nThis is a a a small percentage of radical fanatics funded largely by the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name\nBy the billionaires like George Soros I guess I'm not allowed to mention his name anymore suddenly the victim all of a sudden if the victimizing America for all these years with all of his money suddenly he's the victim\nHe funds let's see on the FAA these funded black lives matter is funded occupy groups to me that's not American by the way that's quite something else\nAnd he was thrown out of Hungary he's not welcome in many European countries all George Soros because they try to destroy their sovereignty as well they can all be Nazis what every Hungarian our loves their own country has a Nazi according to ... George Soros they throw them out of out of Hungary so what he tried to do to that country\nThat closes universities in some countries because of the Haiti was preaching against nationalities against the nation and nationalism\nAnd then there's another thing I said yesterday that should not be lost in the ether of the airwaves it's about so called white nationalists that's the new bogeyman white nationalist just say why didn't nationalist together and immediately you have a boogie man you can hate right\nIf you live in a liberal community has since I was white nationalist white nationalist white nationalist togethers feels good when you say it doesn't it what is it white nationalist\nIs not too broad a statement white nationalist\nSo if you're white and you believe in America and America's sovereignty what you're a Nazi now so look at every cross in every war memorial cemetery you're going to see an awful lot of white nationalist and they're going back to the revolutionary war\nShe a lot of them were white most of them were white and the cemeteries as a matter of fact that our military cemetery just ... was it is and the military was comprised largely of white people and were let's go back to World War two just for a minute\nSo most of the man who wore enlisted to fight many of them are fighting we loved America not all but many war and so they fought why well they would nationalist they loved America and they didn't want to speak German\nIs that simple so what they're white nationalist to show you know defined your terms a little clearer\nWhat do you mean white nationalist what is it actually mean not every white person as a nationalist as a Nazi and yet to the left wing in America they've conflated the terms of having you so you could believe that anyone who is proud of the flag proud of the nation's history\nProud of the culture proud of the language is somehow a bad person think very carefully before you smear whites with that label or else you'll fall down to the level of Jeff Zucker on CNN\n...
