think that you could just claim or something\nElse and now it's happening and we've seen that happen at high school track meets now I've seen it in a world cycling competition and the far left can't say anything about it because they'd have to admit\nThat what they really are saying is crazy let me get a Chuck and Chuck you are on the Savage Nation my name's Greg ...\nA year old attorney tricky coming home to roost really became popular usage country when a war church or all the phony American indian at the University of\nColorado wrote a paper about uh nine eleven a curve\nBecause he did he

it's got he's not one\nI remember that were the Indian tribes said they they said that no they don't they're not claiming him and ... again it goes to this whole thing of identity politics this idea that because of your DNA or who your great great great grandmother was changes\nWho you are and how valuable you are just doesn't make sense that's not how we do it in America so it'd be like saying hey your dad was a serial murderer therefore you are a horrible person\nWe don't do that right um but we do in front of the things let's say that you are a great great great great grandfather was a slave owner that's your fault\nBut let's say your great great great great grandfather free the slaves is that your fault or is that something that you should uh I didn't mean to a fault of the opposite right [laughter] that's something you should get credit for you\nKnow you get credit for what you do in the United states of America it's supposed to be a merit based society supposed to be content of character and what you do and what you create and what your actions are\nAnd yet we're turning it into this idea we're going backwards what used to be a very liberal idea I'm going to treat everyone the same\nI'm not gonna care what color you are I'm not gonna care whether you're a man or woman I'm not going to care what religion you believe in I'm not going to care where you came from I'm going to treat everyone I come in contact with the same they used to be very liberal idea\nNow\nIt's a very conservative idea the liberals say is a way to oppress people\nUsed to be a very liberal idea to say that\nThe way to not discriminate on the color is to treat everyone the same now they're saying if you treat everyone the same that's discriminatory\nThat's how crazy this world is going its upside down it's inside out its bizarro world and I was also telling you about that that was one is not the only problem story for the Democrats\nGamble we go to this this is from ABC News and or ... no I'm Sorry yeah it is yeah sorry Washington Post ABC poll\nGeneric ballot in battleground districts the ones that really count the battleground districts where it's kind of you know we don't know who's gonna win look we all know in the house everybody in the house is up for election every two years right\nAnd we all know there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Republican and there are certain districts that are definitely going to be Democrat I mean it doesn't matter you know the are going to win and this district the ... going to win this district and it doesn't really matter who the names are\nAnd then we get to the ones that are battleground districts where it's gone up for grabs we're not sure who's going to win this one and that's where the movement happens in the house of representatives so this Washington Post ABC News poll looked at those battleground districts\nAnd on the generic ballot right you vote for Republican or Democrat the Republicans are up one\nNo way it's already been so what kind of a life as a\nPer ... the Republicans are up on ABC News Rick Klein took a look at this\nDouble digit Democrat lead nationwide\nMake everybody think in the far left area and then the media and the Democrats but our ... myself that it's going to be this blue wave but what you gotta look at is where the real battles are so here's a Klein says for twenty two days ago\nThey worry that a whole lot of their mid term enthusiasm a wind up a wasted in places they don't need the extra votes\nVery strong democratic areas right nationwide Trump has a forty one percent approval rating Democrats have a fifty three to forty two percent edging the generic ballot for the house but you go to the districts that are toss ups the sixty six districts\nThe lead evaporates and it becomes plus one for Republicans\nWow\nAnd by the way that means that the Democrats need eight twenty three feet flip to win the house they have to win forty five out of sixty six battleground districts to in the house that doesn't look good that's the worst news they've heard in quite a while but wait I'm not done\nWe go to bed or roar down in Texas and

the program a five five four hundred Savage and you're on board\nAnd ... have you been paying attention to the stuff with hurricanes okay I live in Florida so when I hear the stuff about the hurricanes and I'm being told that they are getting bigger more intense and there's more of them because of global warming I said what am I saw President Trump on Leslie stall on Sunday\nI said boy I Wish somebody briefed President Trump\nBecause the truth is there is no trend of more hurricanes on the planet there is no trend of more intense hurricanes on the planet I don't care what the so called experts are telling you and when Lesley Stahl said what scientists are saying that's not true he should have said Roy Spencer\nPHD because Roy Spencer has been studying this stuff for a long time he's a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama Huntsville\nHe's written in visible inevitable disaster why hurricanes cannot be blamed on global warming and global warming skepticism for busy people and he does the facts from our own government\nAnd he's a he's got this out inconvenient data no\nTrend in Florida hurricane strikes\nAnd he's just updated a plot of Florida major hurricane strikes that he's been doing and it and it follows hurricane strikes since Nineteen hundred and that includes hurricane Michael\nAnd here's what he found no trend in either intensity or frequency of hurricane strikes over the last one hundred and Eighteen years and he uses National Hurricane center data to do it he's not making up the data like so many in the global warming movement does do choose me\nSays the trend line for intensity is flat the trend line in number of storms is down word but it's in significant\nBut it is downward not offered so there is no data that shows there are more hurricanes and there is no data that hurricanes are intensifying if you look at real data and you look at it over a real period of time and not just the window you want to cherry pick\nBoy the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm so\nExpensive the history of July August September average the temperature you'll see that since Eighteen sixty this summer is only the ninth warmest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico end\nOf the top ten warmest Gulf here since Eighteen sixty seven occurred both for Nineteen Seventy which is both for we experienced any significant warming\nWell but we're going to get more of these really\nMajor hurricanes are part of nature as Spencer points out and he looked at lake bottom sediment in western like in the Florida Panhandle very close to where Michael made landfall and he said over the last one thousand years it's been relatively quiet for cat four and five hurricanes but\nFrom one thousand to two thousand years ago there was a hyperactive period of intense land falls in the Florida Panhandle in other words there's been time in this planet history where there have been more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes in Florida than there are today\nOr long before so called global warming\nThe way the latest hurricane experts who claim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data\nClaim that there are more hurricanes and more intense hurricanes they don't show any data for that\nAnd when Roy Spencer PHD put Michael in his account of all it's all us landing major hurricanes hit market downward trend since the thirties forties and fifties not an upper trend not an upward trend\nAnd yet they still keep trying to make you think that is Massachusetts Bay colony and sixteen thirty five had a cat three or four storm with up to twenty foot storm surge\nHappened again and sixteen Seventy five you don't see those anymore [noise]\nUntil twenty Seventeen the United states when eleven years without a major hurricane strike according to a NASA scientist that was the one in one hundred and Seventy seven year event to not have a strike that for that long\nAnd yet we're being told that manmade global warming is increasing the number of storms and increasing the intensity and it's just not true based on the debt\nAnd yet Leslie stall made it seemed like Trump didn't notice talking about she was the one the new he didn't know\nWhat do you think\nOh one more one more victory for Trump is getting tired of winning\nHere's the headline from kitty ... Trump was right city council offices headed by the San Juan mayor have been rated by the FBI remember when Trump came out and pointed out there was corruption in Puerto Rico and that there were local failures to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria last year\nWell during the recovery process with the feds San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz regularly came out slamming Trump\nAnd she would have a custom Ice T shirt against him that you were to get on TV Now are officers have been ready to buy the FBI\nWhat's\nThe operation was related to suspected corruption in the purchasing department San Juan mayor Carmen ... Cruz said on Twitter the instruction is always\nTotal total her instruction up for this is total collaboration mhm right the administration at the mayor of San Juan\n\nIs being investigated by the FBI and corruption charges\nDroppers right again\nThere was a lawsuit the FBI reportedly launched the investigation following the February lawsuit filed by the Molina\nThe former director of procurement and she claimed that she was retaliated against for reporting the alleged a regular axe to local controller I have friends in Puerto Rico and when I asked them about corruption they laugh\nBecause if that of course there's corruption is there's there's so much corruption you you would be shocked at the amount of corruption Puerto Rico is a small island and it's all who you know and there is corruption like you would not believe I said even though the hurricane or is it especially with arcane relief\n\nA pie by foreigners Savage get you on the program a five five four hundred and Savage

a nation with someone who's supposed to be your ally but we've always had some issues with\nLet me get Kurt in on that Kurt you're on the Savage Nation go right ahead\nSay thanks for taking my call so I guess some skills the assault frivolous with a thousand dollar that's standard\nYou know it's a good point and that's why Trump said we have to we have to wait and see right\n[noise] yeah I agree it's a bizarre the rush to judgment was\nWell and the reason they're saying this do current is there like hey there's video of him going in there is video of a of the crown princes people going into the council it then a few hours later the crown princes people come out in the caravan but you never see can soggy again you've got to admit that doesn't look so good\nI agree with a look at it but that doesn't even that's certainly pharmacists certainly as safe or whether it's still or whether it's a real staff\nOr let's say let's say we find out let's say our intelligence people find out yup it was the crown princes people what then though do we totally cut ties or do we try and do it hey don't do that again and but still keep these these alliances that we need for that part of the world\nYeah I mean it was a free thing people do bad things are said actors everywhere we certainly have after ... center with Saudi Arabia so I don't know if he's faced out one actually cut all ties with it\nAnd that's my point 'cause we're we're trying to get deals with North Korea\nRight I mean we're trying to you want to try to move forward and and you know countries perfect and no leader is perfect but we are trying to work even with the really bad leaders so why wouldn't we cut off an entire ally it's it's almost like some people on the far left\nWant us to cut ties with Saudi Arabia to hurt our economy so that they can win an election it's almost like that\nNow and then you get somebody like Lindsey Graham that I think is a very hawkish dude who's almost always looking to pick a fight and to be able to do some virtue signaling of you know this is not who America is we don't support somebody who kill somebody who's a journal and yeah I understand all that but there's also the realities I mean look at who we worked with after World War two\nTo three people that we knew we didn't we weren't going to the leaders of of of uh of Russia at the time and in the Soviet Union that we worked with to try to get a deal done\nYou got to do what you gotta do sometimes in geopolitics is not nice sometimes you've got to thank you appreciate ... let me get I'm Kevin in as well Kevin
