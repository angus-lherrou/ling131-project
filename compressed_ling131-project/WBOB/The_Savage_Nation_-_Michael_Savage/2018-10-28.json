absolutely huge show for you to day you're going to want to hear every single minute of it and it all starts right now I I think it's best\nTo start to show out maybe by sharing with you a few comments that I set out to our clients this Wednesday remember Wednesday that was the really bad day\nSend it out Wednesday evening after that really horrible what six hundred dish point drop in the evening via are amazing Gemini private client portal involved\nI sent it out there is no to our clients Wednesday evening after the great stock market up that's what it was a few cup which few all over the all over the wall street in New York Stock exchange for\nPew chicken upgrade stocks\nBefore I tell you though exactly what I told our clients let me ask you a question let me ask you a question be honest with me but I already know the answer assume assumed that when I ask a question I already know the answer what did your advisor tell you to do with your money this week how did they advise you about the stock market puke up\nYou should never conduct business in a restaurant because number one I'll take every advantage I can of you and so I'm listening to these Democrats in the booth behind me to Jay's talking to their whack job advisor who I got her business card I don't even though she's actually license to do business\nBut when you when you when you drag this much politics into your investment career and your investment business this may be a little over the edge\nThis was one whacked out group of people I digress maybe I've gone too far make continue with the script for all run out of time I'm certain [noise] I told you I wrote to our clients that we had bail out US Steel\nSo many times in the past hundred years\nAnd every time we bailed out US Steel all US Steel did was raised their prices I told you in February I was I Would support subsidizing US Steel if US Steel would agree not to raise prices on their steel to American manufacturers\nAnd those were the only condition as I was subsidize that company is actively that would have met with amounted to I'm not having to nationalize US Steel\nBut what is a point of protecting US Steel a new car and chaos and all the rescue dynamics what is the point of that if all they're going to do is cram price increases down the throats of Harley Davidson of caterpillar see all the greats anybody to use the steel and America\nIs a point of that Mr President because maybe I'm not as smart as you maybe my hands are not as big\n\nI'm pretty certain I'm smarter than Peter Navarro I got rocks and in my garden that are smarter than Peter Navarro union\nDoug I told you about this\nBut the union union lobbyist Navarro when he leaves this White House and maybe it's only what Thirteen more days six more days seven nine more days how many how much longer than that you stay with the administration wants to pandering once the red meat pandering to the base has affected us as it is intended\nPurpose which is to get you to vote for Republicans how much longer Donald Trump actually going to keep the moron around how much longer is he going to want to stay because what should happen is we should be making a deal with China like I don't know six and a half seconds after\nThe president wins this election and there should be no used to have an an an idiot like Peter Navarro anywhere around the president's Secret Service should hold him out selling ... your your ears stupidity it's contagious it's monumental it's catastrophic\nEspecially this pain in America for the national security you're a threat to the economy your\nCo conspire with a shotgun to crush the American stock market\nBut maybe I'm wrong what is your advisor tell you\nRemember what I've been telling you week after week after week after week now and I tell you the story for a reason it's usually everything I say is either I don't know to make a point or to make a show more entertaining but in this case is because it's a really smart thing and I really really want you to hear it\nThe cure for high oil prices the saying always used to be was high oil prices right you get\nOil down and the sixty dollars a barrel and it goes to a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel like it did in two thousand and seven and a hundred and forty like it didn't two thousand see I've been around long enough to remember these things and you guys have not\nWhen oil gets up to a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you know what happens to those guys driving those sixty five Seventy five Seventy thousand dollar ... and ... they start selling them\nBecause it's going to cost about a hundred and forty dollars to fill the damn thing up and I don't know who you are but you know even though you can finance that trucker lease that truck for next to nothing when it really comes time to start dumping in a hundred and twenty five hundred and forty dollars worth of gas and you see how fast the mom is try to get\nRid of those toys and that's what's gonna happen again [noise] so what happens is that all prices go up the mommy's are going to say well I Can't afford to fill up the escalator sweetheart you're going to have to walk a little but the school it's only three blocks away anyway you're going to have to walk to school\nAnd the demand for oil comes down and then the price of oil calms down so as you destroy the demand you lower the price of oil and we're seeing that we're seeing oil price so so I'm listening to this whack job make\nBelieve financial advisor to join us more about that is sad sounds buying up all the oil in the world grows a whack I don't know who would listen to this ... donkey story okay but oh well prices are doing is getting ready to go back down to\nSan opinion is just uh\nIs getting ready to go back down to\nIts not opinion is just the fact is just jak because what's happened is that\nThe is the prices have gotten to a point that your do your destroying demand\nAnd that's what's gonna happen for China to cure for the trade war is the trade war\nDo you hear upset I Am with this trade war do you have any idea how many billions and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage or done to the stock market this week has already adult of this pet trade war which is not really a trade war at\nAll\nIt's not a trade war is a plot by Peter no more oh\nCan drag the base out to get you guys all that said hey John and we're going to kill China jaguars do though don't patriots no my team do you don't do your team only aren't teams good\nOh they're trying to do it drag your butts out to the vote next week good go vote\nI have more on China's coming up if you think you're going to push China around to make sure that you understand something America before you send me or hate mail and you send me your emails\nYou know nothing about China you know nothing because America doesn't read number one and what you do read the local newspapers that's all the same stuff from the Associated Press and the rest of the the rest of the wire services\nAmerica I got people that go to China and come back and tell me what's going on in China I see things that I read papers foreign papers\nOr you don't even know exist until you something America you know nothing about China you know nothing about who the economic superpower in this world really\nIs at best it's a draw at best\nIt's a draw the longer and more painful this trade more gets the more likely we are to make a deal because the cure for the China trade or is the prolonging other China's trade war\nBoth sides both sides are feeling the pain one side doesn't have to worry about it because he was elected for life and he's a communist\nThey don't care what people think they print money like we do they manipulate currencies\nThey don't care about the other guy the other guy is limited and restrained by the fact that I don't know presently he's only here for two more years and if he loses elections next week I pretty much going to be a lame duck after that so once I have\nUnlimited power and the other side is trying to fight a trade war while his own Federal Reserve chairman is trying to crush shame one side's\nWhy they went all the weaponry they got the other guy fighting with two hands tied behind his back and Peter Navarro for ... re\n\nI don't know maybe I'm wrong\nSo this is the cure for these high steel prices what we're learning that were caused by this twenty five percent tariffs that the idiot Peter Navarro who is a union lobbyist for the steel industry was then we'll be again and we'll have more money and more kickbacks from the unions and steel industries when he gets out and a few weeks\nWhat's happened to the ... the cure for these high steel prices the caterpillar\nIs telling you we can't sell bulldozer so no science we don't need any more steel and Harley Davidson say no thanks we can't sell motorcycles so no times we don't need no more steel\nAnd whirl pools had to raise their prices on washing machines and dishwashers which is mainly steel and plastic twice and now consumer demand they're telling using the toilet\nAnd no thanks we don't need any more steel\nAnd electro ... the big European appliance manufacturers said the same thing this Friday morning no thanks we don't need no more stinking steal you have managed to destroy our business you manage to\nCrush demand for caterpillar bulldozer for fast so now I'm nuts bolts screws for Harley Davidson for world from washing machine from may to watch you managed to destroy it you've managed to destroy the man for our products\nOverall so now how to make sure all the rules are implies tied to make sure not one damn thing came over that Mexican border that's how I had to deal with China Senate but didn't make a deal with Mexico to make sure they had some border control\nKeep the illegals the hell out of our country so I don't have to build an eleven billion dollar while they never going to ever get built so what I'm saying to you as I Would have rallied a team around me because that's what president Xi and China\nThe team around me because that's what president Xi and China did\nOh you don't have a rally a team either you're on his team or\nHe has you shocked\nBut aren't president wants to go on to battle with China if that's what you believe he's doing two hands tied behind his back and ... and Peter Navarro for a ... right\nNow to Peter Navarro is not a wartime considerably or I don't think so\nI don't think Peter ... Peter is not up to the job that Peter was any good he wouldn't be still wouldn't be a lobbyist for US Steel Peter Navarro was any good\nTo have a real job selling shoes like al Bundy\nThat's the way I Would have conducted a trade war automate damn sure it was a war to the deaths it's either on war to the death and just like via damn nam interests awarded a death or it's not a war war fighting\n\nIf you've got to have a fight with your wife you might as well divorce or move on to\nGet a new one\nBecause anything other than a combination of a divorce it's just a waste that afternoon it's just not worth it you just going to end up buying a jury I'm telling you you're sorry and just buying a dinner and it's going to start over and then not have been resolved and let me make sure that you understand there is no trade war with China\nThis is about bragging your butts out the vote next week\nI got more on China in part to but I promise\nYou I reached out to Peter I reached out to Michael Pillsbury the author of the book the hundred year marathon this week I apparently he's not going to have time to give me the interview that I asked for this week in time to get it on the radio but I promise you\nThe ss China you're not pushing it around the ... ss China that country we call the ss China\nThis little\nForty horse power Honda you got on the back here and going to push the ss China around nobody wants to trade war with China nobody's that stupid Donald Trump didn't get to be as rich as he is by having a by getting into a war with his biggest customer\nNow you guys May of listening to Shaun Hannity and bought into this stupid but my mom and dad and raise know fools\n\nThis is a ruse uses the joke these are talking points you want to talk about fake news I promise you I promise you in a year\nOr two years or six months or a week when this is over one of you come to me and tell me\nWhat this trade war did for you know no I get it if you're apple yeah you got some man you've you've got some protection from patents\nYour if your caterpillar maybe you don't have maybe you got some trade secrets preserve your Harley Davidson maybe some day but you and me you driving around and not white car you and that black are you at home on the arts no you wouldn't get nothing out of this sets up all their profit you had stored up in the stock market and map\nParaded this week thank you Peter Navarro\nSo he said how can God Marty you are one negative ad so you know what\nNo I'm not I'm just practical because right here in my right here my eye pad pro my beautiful brand new apple pie pad pro I have good news I have a headline that you haven't heard you're not going to hear from that more on Sean Hannity you're not going to hear from that idiot Laura Ingraham by the way\nI heard that Meghan Kelly's for sale\nOkay I heard that that crazy whack job that crazy man ... job is for sale if they don't fire ... Laura Ingraham and go bring Megan Kelly back\nI don't know what those Fox boys are thinking but if they were my son's I'd I'd I'd I'd X amount of the will if they don't worry plus replies Laura anger and bring and tell Megan Kelly they're sorry\nAnd replace Laura Ingraham Megan Kelly I don't know what those people are thinking or Tucker Carlson I'd say Sean Hannity\nBut I Know you guys loving honest to God you've got you guys all got a man crush on Sean Hannity\nMe\nTo me if you heard Sean Hannity once you've heard him on thousand times anyway there's great news flashing right across my professional semi professional news wire system\nWhich we now call the Internet there's a new you want to hear is great news out of China here's what I'm saying America listen to what I'm saying it is one hundred percent undeniable that your president has screwed up has passed up this mess with China\nTank\nUnder the supervision of Peter Navarro MRI overall I I I Love all your older client's I really did I Love some of your clients that are older but when you get to be Wilbur Ross his age you need to vacate the premises you need to turn the job over do younger mind 'cause 'cause Wilbur Ross was once a really bright\nGuy but this man is a this guy's adult I mean and this guy this I don't know what's happened to Wilbur Ross I had great expectations for the secretary I mean I really did I truly had great expectations weather is great news there is great news for the president\n\nIs news flashing out of China right now the no one is reporting and China is is is this is putting out yet another olive branch and it will be as every other olive branch that Peter Navarro has received there will be\nPicked up tossed and they're faced stuck in their eyes because Peter of ours a moron\nBut here's the olive branch here's the way out here's a way to turn the stock market around a thousand points next week here's a way to get your money back and it's from China you\nWant to hear it scares the news out of China and nobody's reporting it go after the other guy go ask your visor infidelity van got range ain't over just Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch go ask any of those annuity salesman do ask him all\nIf they heard this news reported it to you and the answer is no they didn't here's the news out of China the U.S that is known as the U.S is refusing to resume trade negotiations with China into Beijing\nComes up with a concrete proposal to address Washington's complaints reading\nAbout forced technology transfer and other economic issues for technology transfers that's what this trade war is about it's got nothing to do with mom and pop who got their butts kicked in the stock market this week\nIf Kentucky Fried chicken ... wants to give away the fifty seven spices in recipes to make the fried chicken to the child comes in order to sell ... gene to sell chicken to the Chinese calms fine that's Kentucky Fried chicken sausage and I don't care\nIf Google wants to go over there and make a special Web browser for the\nThat's Google's get man and I'm not going to make any money on that deal\nPolitical dead man and I'm not going to make any money on that deal\nAnd so so now you hear real clearly what this trade war is about the steel deal was nothing more\nThan ... Navarro lining his pockets with future lobbying feel these fees from the steel industry that was just graft and outright corruption he should be indicted by the same FBI is looking for Hillary's tapes and bombs\nThat was good\nBut what the trade war that the president is in favor of is about is this idea of forced technology transfer\nAnd another way is that going to make your life any better than

protectionism that they could cram a more in the price hikes down their customers throats they were wrong and I told you so\nYou can cram on more than a price hikes down their customers throats they

increases\nTo the likes of Harley Davidson symbol hog that causes inflation bad inflation not good inflation bad inflation the kind of inflation the fed chair Powell Tate\nAny must therefore raise interest rates to stave off from becoming even worse\nOn the surface that's at least a field\nGoal for Kramer and the eagles but wait it's no good because the truth is it's not a good field goal was no good\nGym was right but it's not a good it's no good because the fact the truth of the reality of it all live I've been telling you the same thing for a month since February\nThat I thought inflation was getting out of control I told you I saw it in Jacksonville where every swamp is being drained a put up overpriced overcrowded neighborhoods I saw this housing bubble I saw the same housing bubble back in two thousand and seven I\nTold you that even my brother and my ... my brother from another mother I told you that everyone I Know there's\nMaking less money to me was out buying

for Jim Kramer\nHost of fourteen from Marty in the jaguars zero for Jim Kramer and the\nEagles I Hope I don't turn it over I Hope I don't fumble I Hope I don't Blake it at the end of the ... the end of the segment on Thursday\nNight Jim tells you you just can't own US Steel you just can't own new course deal you just can't steal stocks I'm told us tariffs story is over Jim\nFumbled the ball a major ... bad game control well the eagles bench their mascot\nFumble scooped up I run it back for Ninety nine yard touchdown and buy me your host part lotto team jaguars all the way back to back down the field for another seven points because I told you that you can't own steel stocks go way back when they were forty percent\nHigher than they are today back in February the lay of profits Mr Mr Kramer the points so to me it's jags and Marty Twenty one and I know [noise]\n\nOn Wednesday night Jim told you the story of the good folks that I wrote about the people that make the Roomba vacuum Roomba vacuum and overpriced piece of household I don't know if you use a room\nWith a clean your house you probably don't have a very clean house the same shocked to hear to hear to hear them say that their costs all into the tariffs and I wonder the sky rocketing ah rates of inflation in labor costs were rising\nWouldn't expect that I told you back and I but I told you back in February that these terrorists or a tax on the consumer that you know there were attacks on your stocks attacks on your stocks you know how to use of Martin was attacked on my stock attacks on your stock is when your stock goes down\nRight\nThe cost of that tax is absorbed by the price of your shares so you're shares go down because you got to pay the cost of that tax\nYour shares aren't as profitable as they used to be the folks that I robot says they are going to eat the cost increases\nBecause they're nice guys know not because they're nice guys the business people like me we ain't nice guys they're going to eat the cost of those price increases nearly nearly twenty five percent higher costs they're going to eat those prices because they know\nYou're broke they know your\nConsumers are stopped consuming they've already made a deal with Sam's Club for Christmas they already made a deal to have 'em and Costco and target for Christmas they know that Cosco Sam's Club they get they get no price increases back from those guys\nThat deals made you know why they're you know why would you Martin why are they eating those prices because they can't pass 'em on\nBelieve me if they could they would\nStock is down twelve percent in after hours on Thursday Kramer burnt Kramer and is eagles Kramer Jim Kramer the avatar for the eagles says if the alternative\nIs there room but can pass those costs on to the\nConsumer but I say hey that's not right that is not going to happen that that little piece of junk vacuum cleaner way to overpriced as it is and doesn't really do a great job the really you know the ones that do good job or the Japanese want some from Sam song\nOn Panasonic those Japanese everybody knows the Chinese Japanese dirty and he's they all make the best electronics anyway those things are ridiculously expensive at Christmas is coming and they already made their deal so there's no more\nPrice elasticity but to the extent there is it's a tax on the consumer that your Christmas present from Peter Navarro Donald Trump attacks to pass and everything's going to buy for your kids everything Santa Claus is going to buy for the kids is going to cost Santa Claus more\nEverything\nFive trillion dollars almost twice the size of\nThe value of San Francisco bay larger than the national economy of Australia larger than the national economy of Spain larger than the national economy in Mexico\nJust these two cities in Chang Chong\nAnd you really think that paying of are okay and Donald Trump card gonna have their way what China well I don't think so\nJust the two cities are worth more than San Francisco\n\nI you know people I Know some of your other going God this guy hates Donald Trump ... is just so he doesn't like the Republicans that it's just not true I voted for the more on\nI really did\nI really didn't vote for him I voted for the tax\nCuts I bought it for the tax cuts and against Hillary because what he's doing now is plainly\nStupid and it's on a winnable and only\nThose with the weakest possible mind can't believe that whatever comes of this trade deal has any real significant value\nAgainst China's ultimate goal which is to raise itself up from thousands of years of oppression of being a second uh second settled to the United states a second economic power to you know make no mistake\nChina chooses to become the number one economic power and the world look Europe's gotten used to playing second fiddle to the United states Australia second\nFiddle to the United states Canada's a far away fifty as to the United states does a ten thousandth away from the United states\nYou got to understand this is a war of supremacy war this was a war\nBetween China and the United states and just like tomorrow or just like this morning when the jags in the eagles play\nIt really doesn't matter to me which one wins much\nWhat really matters is the NFL will have put up to really great teams and both will have become better because the other was better\n\nYou don't try to subsidize US Steel with money from the government and you don't try to fight a war against China with tariffs the\nWay you be China is to compete with Chang Chong\nIf they build attorney for my breath smell the hundred and thirty four a mob build a Ninety miles branch to China and turn it into a gigantic city life turned it into a recreation from South Florida\n\nWay to compete with China is to actually get off America's lazy bussing do complete complete America bell the damned branch out the wall [laughter] you're going to need people to build the bread fell the edge\n[noise]\nThis of just irritates me to know when when I see the humanity the wasted effort the motion that America has put into this election to the president to the last idiot and the White House\nWhen I see how much of ourselves we invest in these idiots presidents wouldn't know for ... creative thoughts not a brain cell among them\n\nJeeze God America how we follow these idiots we've followed them get a roadmap to perdition\n\nPresident ... has made it clear says the article that developing southern China and to a high tech region is it's number one priority of goal made even more important they say by the escalating trade dispute with us one\nThat just say real replay myself president the presidents have Chang Chong has made it clear the developing southern China into a high tech region is a priority and more important than ever\nBecause of the escalating trade dispute with the U.S so what do we do we got an escalating trade war with China and so we make certain that caterpillar can't make any might pass not damage to put tariffs on everything\nWhat do they do they just out compete the hell out of America America wants to have a drive for us that's fine I'm going to build me a thirty for a mile long bridge across the ocean I'm going to connect Seventy million people together and I'm going to create my own damned economy another great

did all straight answer the Mets against the Latino or sell it everywhere\nAnd we put ourselves in a position\nYou are still paying a price increases down the throats of uh\nBut you still\nPaying a price increases down the throats of the world pull down the throats of caterpillar down the throats of everybody and and they make the prices of the things that we make so expensive we can't\nSell them and then you then you pass off you're not one of your number one concerts sit in the case of apple China is their number one customer\n\nWho the hell with apple and apple stock okay what do you want to start do you want but it's actually making money and might not go down\n\nThose it if you guys are out here and you're listening to the show because you love my political opinions or you have

asking if\nIt's right I only get one boat I got one vote I voted for Donald Trump because of the tax cuts voted for Donald Trump is Hillary's a pig\nPeriod that was the main reasons\nAnd I'm not voting for Democrats because they're all losers and liberals myriad tub of foreign again if he runs\nBut do I have a life this stuff I Love my mother when I got news for you was mighty angry every damn time she was ... fish on Fridays or liver on Wednesday night and I love her to death but I hated that stuff when I told her to\nI ain't no damn fish on Fridays and every fish\nChina's plan is to

deal with Mexico that allows them to profit on the back of US Economy us trade and\nSimultaneously let some export hordes of illegals spies\n\nTerrorist welfare recipients in our country how do we

to God he's got rich friends that could contribute to be eleven billion dollars\nPlenty of rich friends to just ... to America\nI give up so China accepts my theory on the art of the deal China's plan

assigned to pay a guy okay\nIt's yeah or whatever you want to get more without assigned to pay a guy okay well I got a lot to talk about the fact that my book is launching today or is it really is important to me so I'm very excited about it and I want to remind folks uh if you're thinking of getting a copy or copies for Christmas or whatever if you buy them\nThe week that it comes out which is to say today or tomorrow or it goes to the first week of the ... when they when they put together the best seller lists so\nI I always say to friends do me a favor if you're going to buy the book by it now because it it goes the first week is is the most is the best option for a for us to get\nA on the bestseller list so I just want to say that it's important to me if you're thinking of buying it that you would buy it this week and of course you get the first edition the first printing 'em I actually think this is going to be a thing and I think people are going I think next Halloween\nKids are going to go out dressed as Donald the caveman that could be oh no I'm telling you you're going to be down on the caveman within ... literally pillows we know that my pillow which is our friend Michael Dell they're creating their sending us there you know whatever and at the end of the book Donald the caveman book the down brings us want book he\nBasically says they they said hey we want you to be a new king and he goes no it's kinda like George Washington says no I don't want to be you can you free now you're free people\nAnd a free people you don't have a king a king tells people what to do when they have to do it but a free people tell the leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they say to him oh you mean like a president he goes yeah and if that's what you're looking for um your caveman yeah and so\nThey wouldn't even go to Harlem and get a bootleg probably it'd be better for me if you want that night\nWhen I left you had you on this program a you told me about your\nYour experience at becoming a Christian it's kind of freaky funny story you you realize it's a funny story no matter how much are similar going well for many people if\nPeople listen to part one would you do hear that because we're not going to rehash nonsense yeah or I have had enough of that to happen but I'm the only the so you went to ... when you first went to air Bernard's church you versus the first time you saw\nKind of normal people in a church environment you had grown up with a lot of screaming and attracted a lot of screaming\nAnd yelling and jumping around like I was seven years old and a church last like six hours on number one time I was in church and there was a dead body in front\nRight and nobody explained to me is a funeral was not church I'm thinking that's how they do church so I\nWas normal but then I asked my grandmother gram will happen to them in in the box and her whole explanation was\nHe's in a better place and I'm thinking what kind of box even before like like ... who was no explanation for what you just made no sense and nobody was teaching and nobody was explaining than the way to understood is so I'll just stay away from into the story from the show\nThat you should watch or I'll do what kind of a box of seen before yeah it's funny because you don't know that's funny\nYou just go to ... your reaction you know I actually don't laugh\nAnd I don't laugh you just go in a matter of time life is too short and go you have to do a good time for God's will represent the laughter is just a waste of ...\nJust yell out the horn you do that to you don't even\nAha okay uh-huh that's great that's under the age because what ... what why why do you need to say the whole word you know what I'm saying like\nHoward here and and now look so you're now you're a professional comedian you've been pressured meeting your whole adult life and what a lot of people don't know is comedy is hard\nTo it's not it's not just like eat obtained by some jokes like you really think about you got to write all the jokes then you've gotta memorized them and then he got a goal in front of people and be finest material\nI'll make sure to actually works because if it doesn't then you know it pretty quick because ... comedy is the only craft that the audience can't lie to you about\nWhen you think about if you're going to sing you have no way of telling for sure if they loved it in afterwards whatever they say to you oh it was great you're also maybe could have been miserable because they don't want to promote either yeah but in comedy you're on stage\nIn the joke doesn't work writers no way for the audience to collectively say hey every by let's make them feel better right by laughing at his job together ready to go you can\nI had the the the uh the only time anything like that has happened to me is uh Larry David who of course created Seinfeld\nWith uh what's his name Seinfeld uh Jerry Lewis and and they ... anyway Larry David did something on Broadway was called like a fish in the dark or something like that rang\nAnd I knew Larry way back when before he was famous right before Seinfeld and like that and and he liked my humor and so we became friends he demeaning than buyer's club hanging out with her and then we can all lost touch and\nAnd I um but but you know when he did this thing on Broadway a couple of years of that kind of thought you know I can go backstage and and say hello and I know who to like really freak him out because he knows I'm a Christian and the ... that you know that freaks certain people out and asked me if I care\nChristian and that that you know that freaks certain people out and asked me if I care about actually yeah and so we are higher\nI thought okay middle backstage and I've watched the the play which but it's a comedy and I hated it so much I could not go backstage wow and I know there he doesn't listen to this program so it's free I could tell you that story but you\nDid a show right with ... with a ... on George Carlin you know what to say what yeah which Carlin George Carlin but you know before he died afterwards would have been oh yeah so do the show George Carlin and he\nDid he did one Fifteen minutes on while you shouldn't say God Bless\nLike Fifteen minutes just on that subject and I went on after him and I said lady while George Carlin and God Bless him was and I looked at him the biggest laughs February I just cried laugh yeah which is that such a lame joke but they still laugh at adding that the real thing\nBoys so uh but you're you're right look I mean because I Do a lot of speaking what you just said well when I'm uh sometimes I'll ... sometimes I Will speak but always do funny stuff you have to and that's the only way\nI can know if they're tracking with me absolutely that had happened at times when I'm Talking\nLike pretty serious ... and I'm not getting anything back like I don't know what's going on and you feel like\n... because I'm not getting the laughs\nI feel like the audience is now with me laughter is the only way you can guarantee rear end to that they're tracking absolutely the end or they are there but but you're absolutely right if anything else you really have no way of knowing I mean you can really in play and if it's not a comedy you like did they love it do they hate it I don't know\nYou don't know and then you just got some critics are going to write something about it like if the people that's why I like comedy so much you know media Italy and you'll know immediately if you should probably get another job so I get some uh comedians who asks me questions especially new communities they'll say stuff like how can really make it in comedy and this is my wife\nI said this yesterday on a radio show that was way more fun than this one\nYeah I'm a ... a ... there's no such thing as a pure that are coming here there just isn't I mean there's some really really really funny guys but they're but only to say to yourself I'm going to be a standup comedian only is actually a ticket to Missouri\nWhat I mean by that is it's comedy is a vehicle it's not a destination\nBut now now why is that because I'm thinking of people who did comedy grow you know and that was their only thing so what do you mean by that vehicle to what\nWill a vehicle to something greater than just making people laugh because if you think about some of the greats some of the great thing comedy think about the ending like what does it look like at the end I don't worry about\nOr did they suddenly try to attach themselves to something bigger by one or to want to like one of one of the great to know people don't like the sick all in one of the greats anymore was Bill Cosby\nThere's no doubt in the world of comedy do one of the greats right\nOne of the greats go towards the end of his career before all that other stuff jumped off he actually started going to communities are mainly black communities and

question the other day about uh stores reputation and have a customer might judge that the first thing that came to mind was to look at how long they've been in business\nBecause if a store a person has disreputable that word will get out fast and that business won't be around very long the second thing that comes meant for jewelry stores if it the store's been in business a long time\nThere'll be a lot of folks in the area wearing jewelry from that establishment\nAnd if they sell fan jewelry you can best bet that those pieces have been shown thousands of times and probably passed down from one generation to the next and a lot of people have been told where that these came from it under woods it's our stated goal to be the best jeweler in the south not the biggest\nSo everything we do in

I had him on this program also but I mean his his impressions are just ways are gone maize and right\nAnd uh and of course Don Rickles foster books and Charlie callous are you familiar with foster books and Charlie callous no re is that true that is true I actually think that foster books and Charlie callous or to the funniest human beings\nEver in the history of comedy and the only place I encountered that there'll be like on the Tonight Show with is that rarely but foster books\nAnd jelly house on the on the on the dean Martin roast it Charlie callous trying now I mean those are the only two comedians I can think of that you cannot not laugh like there's no way\nYou're not going to laugh is or where did you bring some you know ... ... talk about for every ... ...\nI kind of laugh is or where did you bring Camille ... talk about for every ... ... yeah it does go very ... very weird is your wife okay would you bring up ex girlfriends ... it was amazing no but you know ... you know he was just\nYou know serious as though you but I'm just trying to think that a comedian that you don't like when I was growing up there was this one now whether that cause I those I Know there's a handful of people that I just think give it to me the gold standard I always think of them\nYeah even is and for me even in school like I wasn't a funny guy in school\nWhen I was in the class clown or grow up in a household where you have to wear were grown folks are talking you just listen to um have you ever see me at a party yeah first of all it's not me as somebody looked like me who grows people right but if it is me I'm In the corner of very quiet and understand anything just looking at maybe taking notes\nBecause of my comedy comedy actually comes from a when I was a kid I used to struggle more reading\nLike I ... up in a quiz is really bad start to look at words differently like I'm Talking about even in middle school\nI'd I'd have to look at the ... and the color to position you what's in front of what's behind it how people responded to it actually came up with seven different ways to look at a word to determine what the where it was no joke for real got really good at it to the point in high school people didn't wasn't really reading I was just working out really really fast now as an adult or we just fine\nBut I still got disability look at words and people in situations seven different ways almost immediately and that's the primary play supplement company you\nKnow where you are right if you're a genius you I'm not kidding you're genius you have a you have an ability to see I remember when I heard you do comedy at one point you went into this in depth he told his story\nAnd I realized that that's just a freaky gift likely to have it is because I mean it could be a curse but it's a gift in your case using it for me right like\nBecause sometimes people they don't ask to see things the way they see them or I just to kind of a gift but you're able to turn it into counter the first person to call me a genius to really kind of touched me a little for real promise you I'll be the last because people need to be geniuses themselves to recognize trouble in the ... working [laughter]\nIf I had far no but I mean I I don't I don't I Try not to use words like that lately I I think it's true and I said that you have you have a a\nYou have a ... and outrages gift and that's what enables you to be funny even the way you talk about humor and you're thinking about it you're looking at it from the different you know lack of means it's just an instinctive thing mhm and they they have never thought about it they just know how to do it put her into\nThere's two things that I've learned that really so whenever you someone laugh to retain more information rather just they just simply do retain like at least thirty eight percent more information that's why the super bowl commercials are so funny they always make them funny because they wanted to remember their product well\nThat's what I Do comedy if I'm if people if their hearts are open I like to make a deposit so even for example in the movie a morning funny we were making a deposit were strategically making a deposit into people\nEven though it's Ninety seven percent funny but people will be mood or as a as a result of this like there's eight year old who come to my shows who are laughing and then even crying as a result of some of the stuff that we share in between\nThe journey step drinking a drug in and they yeah go into comedy who do even the eight year olds ... year we're reaching a you know say hey you need to get your life together\nSo you do not so ... I I'm just fascinated that I Want to ask you a simple question like that you would ask any comedian or you're in France has gone up you you're kind of telling me you didn't have any\nYou know I respect a bunch of comedians and really enjoy watching them now but now I think about the war there were influence meaning influence my style like it was they had a they cause me to change my ... and it didn't really happen I just had my own I just stayed away from it but I didn't want to I", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
