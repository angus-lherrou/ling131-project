I guess\nThe folks I very seldom and I can say I do is not very seldom I probably more times that I Wish I Do talk sometimes about some things that might be fairly irrelevant but from an economic perspective\nI'm so at some point in time we've gotta we've gotta ... we've got to decide a couple of things\nAnd we've got to decide how is our economy going to get better is going to get better from the inside or is it going to get better from the outside and what I mean by that is are we going to do things internally here and the inside of our economy to make things better exactly like we're doing right now\nOr or external forces like a stronger eurozone a stronger or Asia or their economies around the globe gonna help contribute to us being a stronger economy\nAnd we need to take a look at the same time\nAt those things are going to help the rail our economy if it's a good one I Believe our economy is a good one right now I'm not talking about the markets and talking about the economy I Believe our economy is a good strong healthy economy right now\nSo one of the things that we've got to make a decision about\nIs what could be well the economy\nWhat could the rail the efforts of this administration\nIs it going to be eternal internally or is it going to be extraordinarily internally would be things like the pure hatred for this president creates an environment where the president can't get anything done or the agenda can be achieved that would be one thing that could derail our economy\nCould you be\nTariffs that are so severe on our industry which I don't know of any coming down the road that could derail the economy certainly that could happen could it be the Federal Reserve getting carried away with interest rates derailing the economy\nCould the Federal Reserve getting a carried away with interest rates create a hyper inflation\nThese are all internal things that could change the course of the economy in a heartbeat\nAnd I have to say it's a very thin wire that this economy is walking along\nGood fall very easily\nExternal things are going to be things like financial crisis in other parts of the world that are going to impact us\nWhy so if there's a major financial crisis in Europe we would be extremely naive to go about our merry way and think that it's not going to impact\nThe United states market why because finance makes the global economy go around and we're part of the global economy and if there is a financial crisis\nOur homeless run by American missionaries okay and so we had we were taught about chase us and there are different missions groups that would come and visit us we would say learn on the Sunday school songs like Jesus lots of me and some damn sure and so we would think it's a slow me because they would teach it to us and it was an English down for us to learn\nBut that moment that I opened up the shoe box and looked at my items for the first time I realized that the song that I Would thing over and over that that song was so very true that Jesus didn't love me and he did notice me in the middle of this orphanage because of the shoe box\nWhat was that like what are some of the things in his shoe box that immediately grabbed your attention\nThe coloring books and crowns opening not for the first time to seeing so many colors that stuffed animal that was a favorite and my most favorite while item in my shoe box was getting my ownership fresh off or not because I knew I no longer had to share one brush ten other girls well\nBut that's stuffed animal the reason I Love that it was because missionaries come\nAnd they would say I love you and give us hugs but when they weren't there to give us hugs we had a stuffed animal that we can carry around with us and snuggle with at night\nWell it's so important in that and and that's one of the things on the list yes that is so important to try to get into a box or if if you can I Know from Avon in our ... our experience of being there we\nWe uh we think of those stuffed animals dolls that the kids got that when we saw them opening up your boxes and soccer ball fucking\nPaddles a favorite [laughter] yeah\nThey were there were huge so uh we we try we try to do that um so tell us about your journey to Christ um to coming to the saving grace of a Jesus was it as the diet that comment came after the shoe box the first shoe boxes you got us\nYes so I only got one shoe box\nAnd when I realized that Jesus loves me that she that she said planted that seed of hoping my life and realizing OK\nThis is Jason is that I've heard about maybe he is true and maybe there is something to that but I was young I was five and didn't fully understand more than that and then at the age of six that was adopted and now living in Maryland and my family taught me more if we're that Jesus was that I had had a glimpse of\nAnd developing that personal relationship and ultimately are asking price to be into my heart so it was a journey but it started because of that shoe box\nWell and now you speak around the country you know for for offers to Christmas show and share your story\nAnd help motivate people to pack boxes in folks we we need everybody listening if you go to the website financial issues dot org our website\nAnd you click on that operation Christmas Child a better it is so important uh that you do that I mean this means and now today when they get these shoe boxes Jackie I'm they also have an opportunity\nFor the greatest journey right yes so so tell us a about that\n[noise] so what I Love is that it's more than just a shoe box and more it's more than just showing loving hoping a tangible way but showing loving hoping in eternal way with average shoe box that's given the child receives a booklet called the greatest gifts and they're they learn about Jesus from creation to the cross\nThe first distribution the children are invited to return to their local area for it solve lessened disciple shut program\nAnd they're they learn what it means to faithfully be a follower of Jesus Christ and at the end of the twelve lessons that children graduate they perceive what's a convicted and a New Testament Bible and their own language and so from their their challenge to share what they've just learned\nWith their friends in with their families so because of the greatest journey we are creating disciples around the world and helping local pastor's because of operation Christmas Child new churches are being able to start a communities are being transformed and the kingdom of God is growing\nYou know that's what I Love about Samaritan ministries is that Samaritans per se is that they they don't just give a shoe box and go away\nOr they ways up the way ahead\nOf the shoe boxes getting to a particular village or a particular town and they have raised that pastors local pastor's there that are going to teach this this ah greatest journey these twelve lessons and to start to grow disciples for Jesus Christ\nAnd that's the greatest bussing obviously yes or of all of this and and that's why we do it or to share the love of Jesus first with the children as you felt\nAnd to share the gospel message of Jesus Christ ultimately and they hopefully will grow up\nTo be a fully devote\nThey hopefully will grow up to be a fully devoted followers he's this crisis you know what a what a blessing and a we've been we've had opportunities to be at some of the centers where they're giving out these evolved and I have\nAnd uh it is an incredible thing to see and how many shoe boxes um did they did they did last year do you do you know\nLast year the number I Believe was twelve million ... but since Nineteen Ninety three we've sent out over a hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes Taylor a hundred countries and the thing that that number is still continuing to grow\nIt is amazing and a folks there is a church near you that is a distribution center\nOr that you can you can pack you can you can do a couple of things when you go to that link financial issues died or click on that link and I'll take your right to Samaritans per slash OCC right yes and it'll take you to that you can pack\nBox on the line so you can do that online if you want that box will be packed you pay for us to a small amount to do that and you can pack a box on line or better yet he bought an eye on now will do eight this year\nFor our eight grand grandchildren\nAnd a pack that box the older grandchildren we will I'm a want them to participate in that and we can take that to our church our church has happened to be a collection center and we can take that to the church and somewhere there's a church near you and you can get that information on the Web site\nAt um oh OSU Samaritans burst slash ... Americans first dot org slash OCC or go to financial issues dot org and click on the banner and you'll be able to do that and all night you'll find a whole list of things that\nWould would uh we'd want you to pack and we're going to go through some of those things Jackie's pointed out a little stuffed animal that she received and how much that meant you how many years did you did or you you carry that around and have that\nThat will down then well did it last as long as I had hoped to because of the boys at the home never mean and they would feel our toys from us\nYeah so I'm not sure um it is it is amazing to see their their faces and this gift reminds them of the gift of Jesus the gift that we we get and I loved what Jackie said that\nIt ... it really kind of showed\nThe love of crises that you had been singing about\nA four four or so ... some years you were left off of that orphanage when you were just a baby is that right yes yeah\nAnd you got this at age five yeah and then a year later you were adopted yeah and you were here and grow up in a Maryland yeah right here so that's that's wonderful what a blessing [noise] um [noise]\nWhen we packed a shoe box there are a lot of things that I Know we'll talk about this year in the next segment but when we talk\nA shoe box there are certain things that we don't put in and that list is also on the website right say yeah that just a reminder of things that you don't put in like guns in war time\nKind of ah things and candy you had all melt or go bad and things like that so you get that a complete list yeah this is what are some of the uh things that you would tell our viewers when they pack their back boxing some of the things that they need to be\nPraying about thinking about and and participate in it\nDefinitely it to begin with prayer\nBecause prior is the foundation of everything in life and to pray for that child's at that will be receiving a shoe box to pray that God will lead you to the right items because I Know a lot of times people say well if I pack wool hat news scars well that go to our country or if I thought flip flops ... go to the cold country\nAnd you know got already had that story written and you're just being a vessel to complete that story\nAnd sometimes those will items so go to a hot country but God has written a child that needs to be reminded that even though I'm he's missing some fingers that those gloves that he's put on his hands he can see this ten fingers and that's what he needs a C or the child that's been praying to give his mom a guest and\nWe're seeing how they flip flops in his shoe box and so he was finally able to give his momma get\nThose items on those stories are out there and it got has already written\nYeah isn't that that is so amazing and um we've heard stories\nYou know the answer to this but you are I noticed she talked about toothbrushes one of the things I Love you said and\nI don't know if the bond pick this up but to include four of them you know for the for maybe the whole family that's a great idea if there's something you can put in that water bottle um what about the things that you can't pack even things like toothpaste\nOr other hygiene thing from liquid soap and those kinds of things they don't ship ...\nOr or their hygiene things liquid soap and those kinds of things they don't ship will do\nThat now so we like to say something that if it harms a child um we won't accept or if it harms the shoe box um that that's our rules are the war toys\nBecause of this shoe box is going to war torn areas and we don't want to hurt the child that way liquids that can hurt the shoe box and then candies and toothpaste that will hold up shoe boxes at customs ... to stay away from those there's plenty of other things to include right\nYeah I didn't even think about customs 'cause that's a whole nother a story and I know that we were packing one night at our church a tractor trailer of shoe boxes and one of the the the men at the church there were leading this in his prayer\nI don't know if it was before or after we were backing praised the customs for said something about customs and that it would it would get through customs are quickly that's really important to think about as well yeah absolutely um [noise] this is going to how many countries\nOver a hundred countries you know wow it's amazing and bags backpacks those small little backpacks I Would suspect they're good they're all good things yeah\nMhm anything just easily roll up into the shoe box\nIf if someone said to you\n[noise]\nFor a girl and a boy\nIf you know what would be the well item that that um I I Know one is difficult to narrow it down to but what's the one thing that that would be great to put in there [noise]\nThe one thing that would be great to put into shoe box\nI think a toy of some thought because we didn't get many of them and so far child to have their own soy it's just amazing something that they can carry around whether it is that stuffed animal or that soccer ball but\nWith a hundred and fifty seven million shoe boxes that had been sent out what I Can't pinpoint that every one of us had that same wow All right I'm not really liked because of our situations I'm\nSpeaking from seeing all the children out of a lot more than it really didn't matter right and they were so thrilled every child was equally is thrilled\nWith what they were receiving as you know the next child even though there were so many different things and it was such a such any very so a great\nA letter and a picture as a favorite some of the kids that receive shoe boxes when I got one they had pictures and letters and some some of the letters were able to be translated and the pictures they kids would run around all day and say look I Love and love my family\nAnd a growing up and they often edge if you've ever wanted to protect anything you would hide it onto your mattress that night and so at night that picture would go under the mattress and then the next day that same thing they let her would be shown around the picture look I Am love look at my family and then the state\nFor oh that's that's great and it's\nSomething that we we don't ah we don't think about right and if somebody out there wants to coin for those note leave a note or verse you have an idea of thoughts do that calling now you can do

and help where you can be open about it\n\nBut anyway we're talking about the results oh my gosh we use on Capitol Hill are out in full force\nIt was interesting you know I heard some clips yesterday on the news last night on the news talking about showing Nancy Pelosi talking about that Democrats care about the deficit we're not going to raise a deficit that was fun to delve into seven\nIn two thousand and eight\nNow that has seven\nIn two thousand and eight President Obama\nOn the campaign trail in North Dakota said\nGeorge Bush is shameful shameful\nHe said it's unpatriotic it's irresponsible I quote\n\nWas nine trillion dollars he and the Democrats doubled die some for some reason\nWe never commentators ever want to question Democrats'\nThese ridiculous\nEconomic numbers they come up with you know why because all politicians Republicans and Democrats\nKnow one thing the same thing they've known for the last Thirty years and they believe it has to change that this can only be because enough of them have not run in to financial issues the listeners at town hall meetings\n\nBut wind surveyed the vast majority of voters when surveyed and they're given a multiple

think of this logically\nIf you're a politician you are giving a speech you're doing a town hall meeting here trying to appeal to your constituencies so that you can get a vote I\nThink about this maybe are being interviewed\nBy a reporter and you're saying that reporter is probably one of those people to check that box that's the thing they noticed about think about how beautiful this is to politicians\nUnderstand they are free to say whatever they want to say they're free to lie they're free to fabricate numbers\nOughta be am I going to have enough money coming in every month that

concern now often times it isn't a lot of times are concerned is\nWell I've got this huge pot of money I never thought I'd have this much money and I want to make sure my kids get at my airs gathered whoever's going to get I mean I Want to make sure I'm going to hoard I'm going to say that I'm gonna invest in them I Try to grow\nAnd often times they they find themselves in need of a supplementary income they got to dip into this money from time to time and often times it can get out of control or where they might outlive it or it might it might go down in value as are drawing against it\nSo you gotta have if you're going to take the lump sum if you're going to do that you gotta be able to be in a portfolio that is\nIn my opinion on the wall street got him a stock guy I don't so uh my opinion you've got to be loaded up with a good solid companies you don't need to take risk to make money\nYou can have a great salad utility companies other companies preferred stocks things that are a little bit low risk they're still always going to be risk but low risk but there are a pain very good dividends that you're making good income you can build an income portfolio that you're actually living off the income\nAnd you're not dipping into principle you don't need to\nBecause you've got enough income sufficient income that's an ideal situation at the end of ten years not only will you're living off the income but in all likelihood by the end of ten years you're going to have more money than your started with and you're still living off the income\nThat's an ideal situation the vast majority of financial advisors\nDo manage individual stocks they don't even know where to begin doing that they're putting people in insurance products and they're putting people in mutual funds and they're not even thinking about or anything else because they either can't because they're not property license to do it or they don't know how they wouldn't even know where to begin that's and that's a problem\nNow you're exposing your portfolio sometimes it far more risk [noise]\nThe only thing that I promised people that I can promise you\nAnd your friend you can promise your friends\nAnd that's the only thing that really care about some day I don't know what day that will be whether it's Seventy five sixty five eighty five whatever it is the will be a day that the only thing they care about is how much money they have come in and every month they're not gonna care about their portfolio they don't want to think about the economy going down they don't want to be\nThey're not going to care about their portfolio they don't want to think about the economy going down they don't want to be concerned about it they don't want to worry about it they don't want to watch it they don't ... you know all they want to know is they can pay their bills and still live off of what they have coming in and their Social Security and so and so forth\nAnd you've got they've got to be thinking about income so here's the rule of thumb\nThat you can tell them that they ought to consider if they look at the uh county government a county government saying look at the when you when you retire you gonna get\nYou know I'm making up numbers here you're gonna get nine hundred dollars a month in retire\nIf you take a lump sum you're gonna get nine hundred thousand dollars\nIf there they take the lump sum and they multiply that lump sum by six percent\nAnd they divide that six percent by twelve twelve months and not income is less\nThan the nine hundred dollars a month that day or being promise for the\nRest of their life then\nRemember what I said the only thing that I care about so much money they can come in they said that money they had that retirement all their life because they wanted to make more income they wanted to have income to retire on then they got to think long and hard about taking the income\nIf it's close\nThen find it investment advisor a good investment advisor that it's going to put them in individual stocks right\nAnd get that six percent maintain the principal and grow that principle that they're not dipping into principle every month when they take their withdrawal yes\nThat's what's got to happen because the kiss of death for every retiree [noise] is going through a two thousand and eight\nAnd there will be another two thousand and eight ... some point in time and another one after that and you're drawing money out of your principal ... as the market is coming down if you're in a situation you do that it's never going to cover\n[noise] you're never gonna recover it's almost impossible and it and it destroys the portfolio if you're drawing money out that is what it's earning and those earnings continue even when the value is going down\nWho cares so ideal you don't have to care because their value is going to come back up showing them recover\nBackup if you haven't taken the principal so\nThere are some of the fundamental things that you need to help\nUh your your friends to understand that that you know they they've got to look at it very very carefully there is great value and saying I'm going to receive nine hundred and fifty dollars a month for the rest of my life no matter what the economy does\nYeah and there's something for them to be said for that\nYes [laughter] that's\nGreat that's great information makes\nTotal sense and I I think the gentleman that does my um [noise] you know manage just mine is a brother or Asian my church changed is desert terrain anyway but each garage very conservative and I think he's done away or you know\nThat it shouldn't be just like you're saying right right I think you start thinking stern well I mean you know yeah\nI'm so I'm just\nTrust completely you know and if he wants me to do differ on your show man and so that's that's my art\nYeah yeah that's great well that's that's where your heart should be and you know I Hope that if somebody that start maybe somebody that's listen to the program that the knows about being biblical responsible with those investments that were not\nGrieving in the heart of God by investing our money and pornography in abortion and those things and you know that's another that's a whole nother issue and something that you might want to uh\nUh talk to him about because\nUm I can you know a assure you the Lord's going to honor that and a blessed that as well so it sounds like you could you're doing the right thing you've got your heart in the right place but you know there's that some great food for thought to get to your friends to they really need the help they need to understand that\nAnd um there's some great advisors out there they're just hard to find\nYeah you're right and uh [noise] so anyway thank thank God Bless you Dan thanks so much for your ministry and I'll be ... in\n... well I sure appreciate the phone I I just ah thank you for finding the program I'm Glad you found out and a\nThing [laughter] yeah I'm ...\nI'm sure I'll tell you tell your friends about it and will you keep listening very other questions you give us call thanks for God Bless you write\nThat you you have good stuff and you know uh it is so it is so important that we you know I Know I talk about their so often folks I because it is my heart why I'm here\nI Want to do a couple of things\nYou know I Believe with all my heart this ministry as an educational ministry\nI also believe that that ah it's an educational ministry I Know this for a fact that educational ministry that I never want it [laughter] never wanted I winded moan about it for years when I was on the first on the radio I it's not something I I aspired to do\nUm [noise] but coming to the notion\nThat whether I like it or not it's the gifts God has has a let me and I pray that I uh can now use them for his good and if I'm helping you\nTo understand some things selfishly I get to participate in growing the kingdom\nBecause you all will feel better about your money\nNo you're not grieving the heart of God no believe in first Samuel to where the lord says for those who want to me so shall I honor knowing that you're going to be receiving God's bussing and you're going to be able to get more I'm not talking about giving more\nI'm not sure that the kingdom of financial issues is not what I'm Talking about something about the kingdom of Christ I'm Talking about you giving to your church because your church is seen people come to the saving grace of Jesus Christ that's what I'm Talking about you're going to be able to get to great ministries they're proclaiming the gospel and proclaiming the truth\nAnd I get to kind of behind the scenes selfish really participate in your\nMore is what I see but I don't know if that's writer now um but I I Would I Would say and he's all he's very faithful listener and part so I Would say\nThat you would\nWhen your dollar cost averaging like this remember\nI see forty two IT thirty six you bought those stocks I hold five member right you're young you bought those stocks because I Hope you have a ten Fifteen twenty year maybe even or longer time horizon\nAnd whenever we are investing if you're a relatively new investor folks whenever you're investing any stock you're buying in for the long term\nTwo years is a long term five years is a long term\nYou have to understand that in the life cycle of every single stock that you owe in that the life cycle\nEvery single stock you will be damned you will be negative you will be dramatically positive you will then be diplomatically negatives you are going to be all over the place\nBut if you want to be a good\nSolid investor not a traitor of stocks but investor\nThen if that is the case you will\nFind out that in the long run\nYou were going to be fine\nAnd you will likely at least I'm just talking about the stocks on my list in my picks them up talking about in general\nI Believe you are going to do well I Believe you're going to do well\nIn I'm In the long run and that's why you did it originally was for the long run right so maintain that thought and understand that you're there to be doing it\nFor the long run\nSo Sandra is asking me about 'em to stocks\nAnd one of the stocks she is asking made their utility stocks or forty three and twenty nine both utility stocks\nAnd she's asking me if the one stock twenty nine or ... you know is a fish sure she'd be buying into it ahead of any kind of merger\nTalks look twenty nine if he earned income investor since this is an income stock I'm gonna assume your um ... ... ... if you're buying for income look I I don't think you should worry about where it is or what it's doing I Would be OK buying in at any time\nSo yes if you're if you're looking at I'm not sure whether you're adding to or you're buying in for the first\nTime and if you're looking at stock forty three then yes\nUm [noise] I I Would tell you about that stock I think it's reached the so the merger effect of that stock is already done it's a done deal the symbol on their stock is going to change a on\nDon't hold me to this\nBut I think the seventeenth of the month the symbols going to change but the merger is done so yes the symbols going to change ah and but it's already a fish on and and done so I wouldn't be an end by the way\nThe merger is is making this company and even better company to own it's a mid cap gross income company and I was just backed by\nThe end of the year\nOr beginning of next year that you're going to see the stock under its new symbol name you're going to see this uh highlighted and blue it's probably going to be an income stock I'm Still going to have growth opportunity\nBut probably going to be an income stock\nSo uh you know I mean I I don't know if you are you you know I I Would definitely start if you want these utility companies forty three and twenty nine then yes I Would start buying into\nA now if you don't own a ... the forty three\nThen I might consider instead of forty three looking at forty two I'm not no I'm Sorry not forty three twenty nine instead of twenty nine that you start to our costs you an average in in two forty to as opposed to a twenty nine [noise]\nSo I sure hope you're listening Sandra that helps you know we've got a number of other questions are here on YouTube and Facebook will get to them and I'm On the phone for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three will be back right after this\n\nHi this is the and see where you're from financial

I wasn't going to vote before because I knew that it was going to be a blue wave but I'm so angry about this Kavanaugh thing and losing and looking bad I'm going to go out and vote\nMaybe you know that's a possibility but by every visible metric at this point the Democrats lost that fight no question now hot off the heels of that um side show [laughter]\n[noise] and I wasn't going to use the word side comes Elizabeth Warren ... a Pocahontas one of Donald Trump's favorite punching bags [noise] All right so a while back Elizabeth Warren lied\nAnd a million dollars\nIf you look back and said I mean it's all academic but he looked back and say look what he said he said I'll I'll make a donation if you will prove that you were an Indian that's led to quote him he just you know I don't know that she even Indian [laughter]\nOkay I Know they're talking over each other but did you hear what that idiot just said he said that that is Trump Klein of weasel is way out of it\nWhat the hell is he talking about that was what Trump said Trump says she takes the test and shows that she's in India and he'll pay the million dollars now he's saying that's him trying to weasel is way out of it\nHow what is his original stipulation trying to weasel his way out of it that's what the stipulation is that's what this is all about in the first place\nIf I say I'll give you a million bucks if you do ten jumping jacks and turn yourself yellow then you do the ten jumping jacks and says you owe\nMe a million dollars and I said we didn't turn yourself yellow you're like I'm sure you're just how we will your way out of it\nI Do think the president got caught in a particular do you think that the president oh it was Elizabeth four and\nA million dollars\nIf you look back and say I mean it's all academic but he looked back and say look what he said he said I'll I'll make a donation if you knew you prove that you were an Indian that's led to quote ham she just you know\nAnd then you wonder why they get called fake news\nSpeaking of fake news from NBC here's the first story I saw after this whole thing broke from them okay\nHere's the headline Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she has Native American heritage Trump who has said he would donate one million to charity if Warren took a DNA test replied bluntly to the news who cares\nThat's their headline they lie about what he says\nAnd makes it look as if she um that it indicating she has a Native American heritage make it seem like she is a Native American [noise] um now if you go through the story\nAbout Trump calling her Pocahontas they report warns DNA tests were first reported by the Boston Globe which obtain news or the results before they're released to the were before they were released by the senator shore her\nUm the test conducted by Stanford University president Carlos Bustamante concluded that there is strong evidence that one's DNA sample are primarily Europeans said also contains a Native American ancestry from an ancestor in the samples pedigree six to ten generations ago\nSo they say that part according to the summary bustamante concludes with Ninety nine percent confidence that warns DNA sample contains five genetic segments spanning twelve point three million DNA basis which are Native American and origin\nSo now I mean listen to what the this is saying it's making it sound like she is correct about this the report also details a result of several additional analyses confirmed the presidents of Native American ancestry and to estimate the position of in and\nHad mixed Native American ancestor meaning an ancestor it with one hundred percent ancestry assigned to a single population in the war in the family tree\nWorn also released a video of the result and then they give you a little a link here uh\nAnd they give you a little a link care uh she traces her roots in Norman, Oklahoma on the ragged edge of the middle class the video includes testimony so now there's summarizing the video\nUm so I keep scrolling down here the president likes to call my momma liar what do the facts say warrant tells bustamante on the phone in the video yeah outlay that for you in just a second\nWho cares the president told reporters okay so they they're ... they're talking about Elizabeth Warren's test proves that she's got Native American blood and the talks about Donald Trump and it says here later when asked the foreign if he owes Warren apology\nQuote she owes the country an apology what is the percentage one one thousand\nSo they they print that as a Trump quote but they're not claiming that\nThen continuing down toward start to address the controversy um da da da da da da da da da da ... space repeated attacks\nAnd ... ... at a rally in China the challenge warrant to take a DNA test and she said he would pay a million dollars or favorite charity if you take the test and it shows you are an Indian so they actually ... through the whole quote in there so that's cool [noise] and then um\nIt continues\nTalking about the speech but nowhere here does it tell you this is incredible then it has some Twitter tweets\n\nBut nowhere here does it say\nUm um um scrolling down yeah and it just doesn't tell you that she has less Native American um in her than the average white American does not say that so isn't that funny as a matter of fact they they conclude here with a\nQuote from the both from the Boston Globe analysis of the documents in interviews with officials involved in our hiring found clear evidence that are claiming a Native American\nEnds and um ethnicity was never considered in our hiring so the Boston Globe does is probably phony store I'm a research of people saying that was yeah she said that she was Native American but that's not why we hired her\nAnd they conclude their article with that\nNBC News unbelievable we can't trust anything these people say unreal okay so\nLet's go ahead and look at the times that Elizabeth Warren lied about her native\nAmerican heritage Kay she sells identified as a Native American\nIn the association of American law school's directory of law professors in every edition printed between Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five\nAfter becoming a a professor at the University of Pennsylvania war demanded the university change her faculty lifted ethnicity from white to Native American K\nWarren was identified by Harvard law is a woman of color Harvard promoted warrants higher as expanding their campus diversity by hiring a woman with a minority background onto their faculty\nAnd you can read this okay so to all the people who are claiming Well Elizabeth Warren never used her I'm\nNever uses for personal gain and she only ever claimed that she had an ancestor she never claimed that she was an American Indian bats ally\nYou ever see a little kid lie right and they they look like they're telling the truth and you look at the kid and you know the kids lie and they have this complete look of truth\nOn their face okay that's when you spank the hell out of the kid and then from then on when they lie they have this little flinch right that's what you're supposed to do to to uh to race somebody properly K apparently this never happened Elizabeth Warren\nNow imagine that not only is it ... well that's not true because if you if you watch or a while and videos you blinked tremendously so maybe maybe actually her mother um did raise or properly despite being a ... and in Indian [laughter]\nNow imagine that everyone in the room news that the kid is lying\nBut they still side with the kid I mean wouldn't that be like a creepy isn't this weird\nHow people are ... or ... assigning with Elizabeth Warren or at least worst siding with Elizabeth Warren so we have a glimmer of hope now the Democrats seeing how badly they look at least some of them see how silly and ridiculous say look this defending this obvious why\nOh I you know I didn't even have a chance to play the clip of her revealing her TNA test [laughter]\nMine was more in is not to be among canyons we didn't we didn't leasing home my mom's a liar what\nAre the same age as you move we have a Native American ancestry or in your medical ...\n[laughter] the facts suggest it's just a suggestion the facts suggest\nThat Elizabeth Warren is the biggest fat is liar I've ever seen that look guys I don't really care about her stupid ancestry alright I care about the way that she votes and next week I'm going to have a whole thing about\nEconomics and how crazy these progressive czar and this new economic theory it's not that new it's it's just a repackage a old economic theory but when you submit a recipe to a a cookbook called pouch how which is about American\nI'm Indian recipes you sign it Elizabeth Warren desk Cherokee\nGetting rejected by the Cherokee Nation and then claim that you only said that you had a Cherokee ancestor never misrepresented yourself it shows your huge wire\nRather than call these cancer causes they call them cancer drivers proto uncle genes are involved in normal cell growth and division the problem is when these particular genes are altered in some way or simply more active than normal and they become cancer causing genes and this allows cells to grow and survive when they should\nNot be next so we mentioned or they don't want to ... these are also involved in controlling sales growth and innovation don't also catch a chance to make ourselves to divide in ... I'm ... the war is until\nFinally we have the DNA repair genes which are involved in fixing damage DNA cells with mutations in these genes tend to develop additional mutations you know the genes together these mutations me all caused the cells to become cancer is one of the characteristics of cancer that we mentioned previously as metastases\nWith cancer cells break away from where they first formed and travel throughout the ... system and form new tumors which are called ... static tumors in other parts of the body the medal static tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor for example breast cancer that spreads to informs\nAdmitted that a tumor in the lungs is met a static breast cancer not lung cancer you know that under a microscope measure static\nCancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer\nMother made that static cancer cells\nAnd south of the original ... usually have some molecular pictures income on such as they can sense of specific crumble some changes to mend may help prolong the life of some people in metastatic\nCancer and genital salt they try make all of a treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the ... of the concept or to relieve symptoms caused by it\nSo most of the time treatment is not focused on healing or just reading the body of the cancer itself most treatment is here to just prolonging life and relieving symptoms the reality is that generally met a static tumors cause severe damage to how the body functions and most people who die from cancer die admitted static disease\nAnd they're not every cancer
