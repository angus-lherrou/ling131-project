I you know I get them from time to time but not like the last couple of months and I've been getting email\nWhich means you're giving up your current income stream and once you give up that income stream the ideal situation is to have a really nice adequate emergency savings set aside\nAnd some other just you know normal everyday kinds of things savings are checking account set up because\nUm you want to commit fall of your\nIncome that is now a fixed income and the sense that you know it you're you're on a fixed income you know you have you\nGot a pension you got a four one K. you got Social Security or whatever you have there you know what that is and so it all it all comes to uh you don't want to use some of that income to put aside in in\nEmergency savings you weren't already have that [noise] so uh\nI Would say if you have been relatively new home you don't feel like you feel like most of the maintenance or things that can happen you're going to do out of your regular you know just your normal income stream from on a regular basis you don't have any debt\nYou know certainly you want to have a ten thousand dollar you know emergency savings account eight to ten thousand dollars but I Would say as you get closer to that retirement and you're now you're you know two years away from retirement you want to have that build up a little bit more\n[noise] um yeah no I agree [laughter] it's not that not because I get it from like the working perspective that a long time to go like okay I'm On the market the you know my right Robert ... six months expenses what every year and I just didn't know if\nI guess I heard your last Frank I'm somebody asked about how much money do you eat you know outside of that before you can retire and you had let them know that you should be able to plan out of five or six percent\nReturn so I get as far as like OK shooting for it and come straight to be able to let on right but then I was just wondering okay like in addition to that you you you know how\nHow much maybe as the percentage or I guess the first time it wasn't really work but\nLike well I I mean remember ten years ago Fifteen Years ago\nI Would have been worried not not I mean if you were Fifteen Years younger I'd be worried about I'd ask you things like what kinds of jobs do you have the feel secure in your jobs have seniority\nIf the downturn in the economy would you likely get laid off because you're in the construction industry or would you be fined because you work for the local government\nOr you're a teacher you know cry so I Would look at those things 'cause they're critically important when you think because if I lose my job do I have enough income to carry me Kerry my expenses\nFor six months so very different situation I'm not as concerned about that for two reasons one is your little closer to retirement a you're a little bit older I Hope you have some you know real sense of the security or in your job and the other thing is we live in an environment right now where\nUm the threat of you know lay offs and losing a job um aren't as big a deal say they would have been seven or eight years ago [noise] so\nI think I think the important issue is to take care of those emergency expenses\nThat you don't want to get in debt to fix so well I have a credit\nCard if my furnace blows up I'll use credit card well yeah but now you got the debt and you're going to ... dead for ... years\nSo that's not a good strategy a better strategy is my furnace blows up I've got savings that I can replace it with [noise] so for and you know or maybe you have income that you can use you know but so I Would just keep it isolated to those things and everybody is it a little bit of a different situation and that\nThat ... area that's why I hate to say you ought to have five percent of your income for ten percent of your income or you know one third of your annual gross salary you know committed to emergency savings because it may not\nIt may not be the case said it all you know\nSo I Would just try to work backwards towards some worst case scenarios of what would happen right now and do I have emergency savings to take care of that so I don't have to get that\nOkay [noise] okay thank you very much\nAll right Bonnie I'm Glad you called I sure do appreciate thank you for your partnership that's great uh sure appreciate it [noise] let me go to stand San also calling ... staying also calling us from Ohio a stand\nAlone to an ... good morning here last year saying by speaking the gospel truth for finance or with a band aid but I'm In the street\nAnd better question about my own specific stock jokes on reference on on\nSpecific stock reference on on a teacher and coaching or their finance minister rushing retirement age and leaving it legacy or the next generation licensed broker\nA stir right right\nI was wondering what the lawyer [noise] someone said oh I lost money because they're not a light switch stockbroker trophy salesperson yes do I handle\nFinancial liability\nIn my area was a minister\n[noise] well I don't think you really have a liability and they're um the liability comes when you're charge enough see\nThat's when you have a liability so if you charge somebody if somebody says you know a pastor I was thinking about investing money can you help me\nAnd you said you know what for you know I for sixty five dollars an hour you know I'm I'm you know I'd be happy to help you then you got a liability um [noise] so I wouldn't be too concerned about liability\nBut even me one of the things that I Want to do more than anything else and it may be easier in the environment in which you're working for you to do this\nBut my our goal should be you and I stay in our goal should be\nThat the people that are in front of us that we want to convict them\nTo bring Jesus\nInto their money\nWe want to convict them that as they would try to walk closer in their day to day world activities with Jesus that they would not separate\nAnd compartmentalize their finances\nThat that that too would be a part of their walk and face\nAnd we want to convince them of that we want to share the versus you know what you hear me say that God says\nAh for those who honor me so I see on or not he says that in in first Samuel chapter two at the end of chapter two in you and and then you kinda have to read that whole chapter to to get a feel for that promise\nNow I don't know I thought what an honor looks like and I don't think we should be promising prosperity but I Do believe we can say you get a sense of peace\nUm uh by knowing that you're not grieving the heart of God with how you're investing your money and it's important that we pray about how we should do that where we should go and some ideas just as you speak you know some ideas would be look from what I understand\nThere are\nThere's really only one mutual fund company that you can diversify your portfolio\nAnd diversification is important so you oughta call this Timothy planned group and talk to him where you can fully diversify your portfolio there are a couple other bitterly responsible funds you heard me maybe yesterday recommend a a um\nInflation protected bond fund for somebody that was a spit book and responsible to vanguard fund typically responsible most\nGovernment bond funds are biblical responsible so there are some other alternatives but you know or use some of the pigs you know I I Believe in things if you want to want to do that but you know ... of the key is your job is to convict them do want to do that\nTo to want to make sure\nThat they're not investing in a company that are supporting abortion and pornography gambling and the redefinition it was funny I I Know in his shoe I'm I'm a mutual fund company that holds themselves out as being Bibeau the responsible somebody this morning a friend of mine sent me an article with a picture\nOf this company set up at the uh L. T. G. beach convention um you know I'm a ... where the booze tried to you know bring 'em the their their marriage or\nSo you'll know when to sell\nSo um yeah hopefully that helps routes everything on Facebook if you got a question or on Facebook you can chew it up\nA any any time we'll get that get to that [noise] ah John on YouTube and say hey Dan can you explain a little bit about dollar cost averaging down I heard you speak about that earlier I'm very I'm very new to us\nDamn I heard you speak about that earlier I'm very I'm very new to all of this and a new partner um so but you but I've never heard that phrase before I'm great John I'm Glad you asked so here's how it works\nYou own a stock you bought this stock for twenty dollars a share and yesterday it crashes it goes down to ten dollars a share\nAnd let's say you own a hundred shares well when it goes down that way and if you buy another hundred shares\nUs just dollar cost averaging down your share price now your share price your costs basis for your share price your average cost basis is Fifteen dollars\nAnd you don't have to wait for the stock to get all the way back up to twenty once it gets to Fifteen\nYour back even if it does go back to twenty you're up significantly\nThat dollar cost averaging down I use that very simple example of doubling up on your shares and all that most people don't do that but if every time you dollar every time you buy shares bolo what you are originally pay for it\nHow many shares you buy doesn't matter you just lowered the overall average share price for all the shares that you own\nSo when when you buy a share thirty and now you're buying it at twenty five\nAnd then you buy to get at twenty two and then you buy it again at Nineteen you are lowering your average share price for all of the stock that you won't\nSo when you do that and you're a long term investors I Hope everyone is you you you now are doing yourself a great service because one you don't have to wait as long\nTo get profitable because your costs bases is lower so you don't have to wait as long and number two\nWhen it does recover fully back up again to where it was you're going to make a whole lot more money instead of just breaking even\nSo that to a dollar cost averaging is and you hear me say sometimes why no no don't buy into it now I don't want you to dollar cost averaging ... up\nIn other words I don't necessarily want you to buy I Do it all the time because I'm looking way out in the future I say I don't care if it's up um buying I you know I'm looking at belong to a very long term outlook but I don't ... you know that's not a good practice to get into the dollar cost averaging up unless you really want more shares of that stuff\nBut your dollar cost averaging up you don't want to do that that means you bought it at twenty and a six months later to twenty five and you decide to do like the stock and you buy more twenty five that's not necessarily good thing because now you're raising your average share price\nBut I may be okay because it may be on the move upward and onward for a long time so\nThat's what that's all about it's really good to understand the principles of that when you're managing long term money is a very good to do that and hopefully a you understand that I Hope I explained that right\nSomebody is asking true grit is asking ah using your income port for full year to cover your R.

that over into well is it a qualified is that an IRA kind of account\nNot that I Know oh okay well it is\nSo you can move that over into a you know an investment accounts anywhere you want so let's say you open up and eat trade account or a you know to the marriage rate of fidelity somewhere a brokerage account you can move that money over there\nAnd then you can begin to work on you know a building your portfolio\nBesides so the first thing the question you want to ask\nIs\nI Would form it like this I looked at my statement\n... whatever the last statement was my I currently I you know the date of the statements I had on making numbers out but I have fourteen thousand dollars in there mhm so if I decide I Want to\nUh I I may be thinking I may want to surrender the contract\nOtherwise turn it back in and get be done with it and I may be wanting to surrender the contract\nSo I Am assuming I'm going to get fourteen thousand dollars if I Do that\nOkay and\nSee what they say [laughter] that'll that'll be that'll be a great opening conversation to get you know to find out what the deal is now they may say yes that's right but would you like and stole taxes\nAnd I would say yes it's there's a taxable portion on that whole those taxes but make sure it's not income tax and all that that it's not a qualified playing you know make sure that it's not considered IRA money\nBut um anyway that's that's what you want to ask them today or whatever okay\nAll right okay well we'll go from there yeah sums up I'll call you back\nThat sounds great I sure do reverse thank you Judy I'm Glad you're a listener thank you Bye bye Bye bye let me go to Helen Helen is calling us from Tennessee hey Helen\nHey Dan how are you today I'm good\nFrom Tennessee hey Alan\nHey Dan how are you today ...\n... uh same here we are partners oh good then let it for about three three months and we are in\nThe three savings account with my husband worked at the post office okay now Seventy four and we've been taking an allocation every year every month ... patients from that this year we're taking a thousand dollars a month\nUm we we're we're we're in the sun the sun and we're in at forty three percent that the sun at a lemon and the sun at forty four to hear that pretty probably aggressive for our age yes\nBut it has worked really well up until this week we've taken the money out and have it you know we've kind of stayed the same lead not decreased any until of course that sleep and we have but we roll with that yeah anyway we we're trying to roll it over to explain track\nSo my questions are being in contact with Timothy I've got the application in front of me\nI just need to know where to put that money in the end of the plane I I think your allocations are right age group\nSure now let me ask let me ask you this Helen ... out of out of that money how much is in the G fund\nJason how much money I mean ... percent ... roughly look up here a\nShare prices the balance would that be a lemon thousand two Ninety three thirty eight okay\nSo if you were to move to Timothy when you're taking a thousand dollars a month now [laughter] now I Would assume you don't have any problem with\nDepleting I mean you're so you're obviously kind of on track no matter what what you do or where you go with depleting the money\nMhm you know at some time and they're not too distant future\nIt's the it's right now has about Ninety three thousand or ... it was you know not Ninety eight the beginning of the month beginning of the late\nPlaywright so and and so if you're in a place where you're going to continue you know as long as you can to draw that thousand dollars a month sale which is which is fine\nInvolved but if that's if that's where you are now than I I Would look at um\n[noise] I'd I'd be careful about\nYou know where so right now and a failed in dollars a month you're going to draw that out for seven years eight years I'll say here's\nThe Atlantic um then and then it's going to be gone what my concern is and this would be the same concern with the city in the ... as well\nIs that\nSomething could happen like it's happened this week that could be pro long\nUm you know for an extended period of time which which create the ass in the sea fun going down you know maybe significant way\nMhm and you're eight years now is going to go or making all this up but you just to draw a picture so the so the eight years now is going to go to six years\nOkay of a thousand dollars a month\nI wouldn't want that to happen so if you're staying in the S P\nI I Would want you to consider\nHaving no and I don't know that it's a media but certainly by the end of the year so I think you're going to recover what it's been down over the next couple of weeks and and then even then some depending on how the elections go\nSo I'm okay stay in where you are but at some point in time and the next year or so if you stay in that she has to be that I Would want you to move the embassy fund over to the G fun when you've got a pretty good profit in their moved over to the G front\nThen I don't think there's anything else you can do because it gets too risky\nEvery if you're drawing let's say you're drawing a thousand dollars a month and this is after you've gone through the eleven months in the G fun and you've got an now draw it out of the CNN is fun\nYou know ... those funds are too volatile they could go down easily\nAnd again cut the time off that you have\nNow they could go up and add to the time\nBut it it may be a little bit too risky for me to tell you to do that\nBecause now I Would suggest that\nIt may be I I don't know that I Would\nWant you to move to Timothy because Timothy doesn't have a G fun I mean they've got a fixed income fund which is similar to the G ... and\nUh and and all you know government bonds but it's not going to allow you the same rate of interest that the G ... does\nSay so I think\nAnd the G fun would would be about as close to biblical a responsible as you could get staying in the tea is that you may it may be totally biblical responsible actually because it's a this point it's all government\nBond fund so [noise] I I Would I think it might be better for you to stay in the CSP\nOkay based on what you were telling me now if you said to me you know what we we decided we're not taking any more money out we don't need it that would be a different story but just because of what you've told me that's why I'm saying that\nAnd the reason we're taking the thousand is to to diminish the money to get it out of that we don't pay much taxes because that's how we can take out without paying taxes on it every you know and he comes back\nAnd that is a great great strategy so if you're taking that out or you're saving it somewhere else\nIn [noise] no no no not really okay All right that's far out we don't\nThat much anyway ... security\nAnd and have a little tension sure though it\nIt just made it easier living\nGotcha yeah no I think I think you're ... you know you're on the right track I Would stay but I Would just stay in the G fun I think it makes the most sense\nOkay I'm not sure I Would love to have is a partner I'm not you know and I'm not trying to discourage you from going into\nHey Dan found battery is Ryan Dan okay you're right you're right\nI don't think your income hurtful I may take a look at the usage asking which I'm Glad that I think yes and I'm Wondering if I buy chicken tainted take those profits on a limit auditor\n[noise] um yeah yeah I Would yeah\nI mean you know as long as they're you know meeting my uh criteria of being over you know a certain percentage I I I think that's fine yeah\nOK\nStocks and waited and that\nWe're doing well with this death and it's going to get to the point where I'm going to be able to sell them at a good profit when I Do that and I sell all of them can you walk me through how I used to vie anti ... how many shares I should say at one time it's like five hundred the Mac\nYeah so when you sell them you want to sell them\nFor the current price\nThat you that your show you know that it's showing when you go to place the sale but you don't want to put a market order in fact if you want to put a a you know a limit order so that if it drops starts to drop down below that price\nIt won't sell ... so we generally what that happens I don't know of five hundred shares\nIt would happen I think let's say five hundred shares I think it would probably sell at the price you want I think you'd almost be doing it safely doing it a on a market order but if you want to be certain then that's what you would do so you may see oh yeah we sold\nIn the same day you may see we sold a hundred and Ninety seven chairs then we then you sold sixty shares than you so you know another thirty shares in stone and so forth and you may see the confirmation on the sales come through like that\nBecause what it's doing is every time it drops every time it goes up to the price you want it's triggering a sales but it only as time maybe to execute you know a hundred and twenty shares before drops again\nAnd and that's what that's what I have for each time that there's\nNo no no no okay well now there won't be the only be one fee it's one cell order so they're only be one thing\nAnd shit I consider the ... the other day in day that's how I fell\nYeah you should consider it I mean if you're close if you're within thirty days\nOf the activity and I would probably be holding\nOkay thanks and thanks a fan of this line and keep it up for that that\nOh yeah we'll do it yeah thank you for that a vacation for she added that blanche alright I eat and thank you I appreciate\nYour thank you for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three let me get to Kenny Kenny calling us from Arkansas guinea\nAnd then how are you doing this morning on my wife and I are partners and I'm calling on behalf of my mom okay\nShe's currently has um about fifty thousand invested in a couple of them actually a few different putting them on uh-huh and um it looked to me like that you know is is pretty\nLow so I'm Wondering I'm ... um\nWe have an appointment with her um investment person at noon today and I'm just wondering if be worthwhile or her a little\nUm these out of putting them and then to tend to the ticket um I don't know that she would get a better deal but um at least I Know that they would be biblical responsible\nYes I mean I think it would be it would be better just strictly from the biblical responsible perspective I don't think you're going to get a better year old\nUm you may want to uh consider how is she is she you know I'm using the dividends she gets is\nYou know I mean is that something she from an income perspective she's she needs\nNow is not like it or something she's relying on it just extra yeah her income or\nGotcha yeah I mean I Would move it I mean I think it'd be great to you you know to help her get typically responsible\nAnd and I think that would be a great thing to do and and uh you know so yeah I mean you're going to get a you know you can ask Timothy as far as yields when they get paid out and what it is right now and and uh\nYou know get a handle on that\nAnd uh I think that would be that would be a good thing the other alternative would be to put her in some\nSome uh you know individual stocks like utilities maybe two utility stocks and the you know three three preferred socks and um you know that would be another option\nOkay I'm a I just had a question and I went out of my head as quickly as it came out and\nI'm ... I'm Sorry about that it's okay well I Know in front of them are fighting to get off the phone and I appreciate your health and you can any I assure appreciate\nMan I appreciate it so many people the

know I'm you know a trust is going to protect them from things that they really aren't\nSo I Would need a little bit more um clarification so if you're trying to protect him from taxes\nRight now there are no taxes no state tax I mean there's no federal taxes to protect or there won't be next year so I wouldn't ah you know you don't need it to protect them from taxes that is for certain\nUm so I don't I don't think that is the case you want to protect them from all a possibility of let's say a nursing home you know Medicaid or getting getting a hold of that money that's going to help that either the only thing that would help that to a certain extent as ... irrevocably trust and I um [noise]\nYou know I I have and I would not recommend that but so you're not going to protect against that nothing nothing could do that\nSo I'm not sure what you mean by protecting so I I don't know if that answers your question I Wish I could but um\nYou know it it it won't ah you're also asking I guess it's the same Lucy or another Lucy asking which annuities are biblical responsible\nWell there aren't any annuities there are some life insurance companies that issue annuities that are biblical responsible but the problem the thing that makes it on biblical is the investments they use when you put your money into the annuity so that's the problem\nThank you for joining us this is ... ...\nAm

spoiled for choice on subject to talk about let's start off talking about the Facebook purge as people are calling it Facebook has banned or unpublished over eight hundred\nUser pages and accounts\nAnd this is incredible the reason that they say for this is for these ...\nSure all at once and all of these are anti establishment pages I guess you could say these pages are both on the left and right of the spectrum\nLet's take a look at some of these pages that got banned\nThe free thought project now this is a libertarian page you know as much as I Love libertarians I really don't follow a lot of them I just don't spend a lot of time on social media but I've heard of the free thought project\nThe widely known website which calls itself a hub for free thinking conversations focuses on government transparency founded in twenty Thirteen by Jason bachelor and Matt agar is\nThe site claims to shed light on corrupt entities across our planet it's reports have been covered\nAs reports of covering the months ...\nPolice brutality and shootings in the U.S as well as insight into how the American government gets personal information about any citizen ban on Facebook and band on Twitter so after Facebook band these people\nThey will to Twitter to cry about it and that in itself resulted in a band\nSo [laughter] the thing about this is that Twitter you sit there and people and gives them the only reason right now they don't even give you a reason so I've seen screened cats so which is a basically a picture of their computer screen\nI seen screen caps of the reason they don't have what they say you would have been banned or whatever from Twitter because of and then it's blank they don't give a reason that [laughter]\nSo that's incredible\nThey these they Facebook and Twitter they're claiming that you've been there that you violated the terms of service and so they've banned you but they don't even have a reason why I write so you don't know the reason\nSo they've banned you but they don't even have a reason why I write so you don't know the reason you can't fix it you can't prevent it\n[noise] this has got to be I mean this smacks of just you know ... going to the the government for some reason right\nI mean obviously all these places getting band at once this is insane you know\n... across platforms you know if one platform was doing it you could kind of see it but remember Alex Jones got got banned from everything all at the same time and everybody was like what like well he didn't get banned from Twitter but as soon as the hearing the government hearing was over and Twitter was out\nOf of the uh out of the woods they instantly band Alex Jones also\nFor any reason my opinion a photo arena\nGuys there's obviously censorship it's not even hidden now it's it's incredibly transparent what these people are doing\nIt's time for a new platform to come up and take its place I mean this is how it is right look at Google when they started they said you know aware nice company they're number one I'm rule was do no evil\nAnd now that rule isn't even on their list of of um\nWhat do you call it talking points of of their platform their reason for being it's not even they're\nSo pretty interesting you know how you you start off as the rebel and then you become the establishment right\nSo um you know did did anybody cream and cry when you had to Hillary Clinton doesn't go to the states that um she feels she has in the ... already you know doesn't it bother to um to to service them at all\nBut has um who's a singer and Jay Z and I'm\nBeyond say do a full fledged concert for her\nSo I mean you know I don't take away these ... publicity stunts\nBut what I'm enjoying seeing is the incredible reaction to them\nAnd I know why I Know the reason why it's because they're afraid that Donald Trump is going to get popular with the so called Democrats base of minorities here\nThey're really afraid that people are going to start things for themselves and people do think for themselves as very obvious\nBut you know the flow of information is important because people can make right choices when they have all the information and when you have someone like Kanye West who is famous and a lot of people do lake so whether you agree with him or not you are paying attention to what he's got to say\nIs pulling for a Republican which goes against the stereotype right Thirteen percent of blacks voted for Trump to know and the previous election right and I asked my girlfriend I said so how how many um what do you think Donald Trump's approval rating is among blacks nowadays\nAnd to me personally I Would think that that would be low the reason is because of the constant\nStream of press and messages that we're getting that Republicans have minorities they hate black specifically\nAnd so I Would think that well if I was black and I keep getting told that somewhat hates me I'm probably going to believe that you know they keep ... talking running story after story um show after show about how Donald Trump is a big it\nSo to me I Would think that that would lower the rating my girlfriend news very intelligent sometimes says well I Would think it'd be about forty percent it turns out to be about thirty six percent I said why would you think that it would be forty percent\n[noise] and she said because Trump's approval rating is about that high and you know among people is that high blacks are people [laughter] despite what the liberals\nWould have you believe you know they would think that the liberals what have you think that any minority cannot closed feed or ... or otherwise take care of themselves right they can't get a driver's license they're incapable of you know figure out where the closest DMV is\nUh they are completely helpless without a white people helping them out right so that is the thinking of your typical liberal [laughter]\nWhereas my girlfriend is a classic liberal and you know just things that people are people are which is\nAbsolutely correct and so she's able to predict what the percentages are\nSpeaking of insane liberal so here's what a Alec Baldwin or says [laughter] Alec Baldwin of course has been parroting Donald Trump on Saturday Night live for a little while now and this dummy is what he parodies Trump to be okay\nThis dummy is what he parodies Trump to be okay if you if you're the quote he says is to the Hollywood Reporter\nMcKay quote I don't know how to say this and I don't want to get it wrong either because everything is a minefield of bombs going off [noise] but ever since I've played from black people love me\nThey love me everywhere I go black people go crazy I think it's because they're mostly afraid of Trump I'm not going to paint every African American person with the same brush [laughter] [noise] but a significant number of them are sitting there going this is going to be bad for black folks [laughter]\nFilled different exactly what I'm Talking about right I mean you're you're this social justice warrior liberal\nAnd you believe that the whole world of minorities are throwing you up on their shoulders like um see three PO where the uh with the he walks right [laughter] and they're just like\nGive me all the ... it's because they see minorities as being below them that's the reason they do not see them as equals so when they do these stupid stunts\nThey actually believe that they are the champions of people of color and they couldn't be more wrong okay [laughter]\nI Wish that went on break burst alec Baldwin's bubble and just let them know that people color don't care about you okay nobody cares about you know you're not a hero you're not a champion you're just a funny guy on TV and we look at you know we laugh sometimes I'll write the only person who thinks that you're changing the world is you\nKnow these guys is gone crazy [laughter] but\nI Love watching it but it's it's a shame I'm worried that these people are going to get into power and make things even worse at least right now these are just you and cry it's right they're not actually doing anything but I'm I'm worried that they're going to get in there and actually start messing things up for\nFor everyone okay [noise] so um oh God oh here's another example [laughter] here's another example guys so\nWe have Eric Holder All right Eric fast and furious holder miss dummy\nSays you know what I'm just going to let me find a clip here so this is Eric Holder and he's talking about Michelle Obama when she said when they go low we go high which is kind of funny to me because I I don't\nKnow if anyone goes lowest Democrats right but everyone has their own perceptions anyway here's Eric Holder's take on it\nShe says if you ... [noise]\nLegal ... [noise]\n\n\nNow many people disputed whether or not this was the call to violence\nI mean it's definitely violent imagery right and when you take these things that are happening so for instance remember the mob at Kavanaugh's confirmation I mean they're banging on the doors it's very frightening and\nTake this statement from Hillary Clinton and take Hillary Clinton please [laughter] so this is Hillary Clinton on CNN and a reporter asked her a question\nDo you see any way even a conservative think who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America should try to get back to some civility and you try to make it even if we have pinnacle disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another or working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now [noise]\nSo the reporter is saying you know um that Republican said that the only way to\nKnow unite the country again is to\nReturn to civility and then defines it as a not warring with each other not destroying each other and then Hillary Clinton gets on and she even she defined civility as saying that uh we uh will\nUm listen to each other and that we will try to resolve our differences\nWhen she said working at our differences but then right after that she says that's not the Republican Party today so in other words he's saying that unless we get rid of the Republican power\nWe cannot have a return to civility other words we can't\nListen to each other or work out our differences or if you're going by the other person's um definition that we must war with each other or we must his story each other and\nIf you don't believe me here's a so then Hillary Clinton gives an example of Merrick Garland on getting um are you hearing for the Supreme Court nomination and then she says is\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nBut until then the only thing that the Republicans seem to\nRecognize and respect strength\nGuys does she not sound like a comic book villain or a movie villain justify why they're the villain isn't that what that sounds like the only thing that was so respects a strength so we've got to be as bad or worse than they are\nThankfully we don't need Hillary as permission to be civil towards each other everybody thanks for joining me\nMany times wheelchair handicapped person when going through the doorway bump into the doors trim both injuring themselves and the doorway itself\nSo we propose at the home have no less than thirty six inch doors also there's often adore Jim that stops the wheelchair from easily moving from one room to another some other type of transition of the floor from one room to another might be considered\nIf yet considering moving into and all that Hong you may need to re size and do way these my including not only widening the opening but you may need to read okay wiring I'm they step tickle position so that they are not in a way\nSpeaking of receptive goals I've noted that many if not most receptacle in homes are built to low for people with handicaps since most formal dining room table or thirty inches tall and even informal dining tables are often no more than twenty seven inches off the floor
