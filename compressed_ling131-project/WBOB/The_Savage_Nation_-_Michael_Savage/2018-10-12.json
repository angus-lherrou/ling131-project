you feel good and the political climate it's total mayhem and total madness when you think about it as almost nothing to feel good about and we all living in St times one way or the other\nWhichever way you turn as America really integrate spot right now I mean the economy is good and we're not really in any foreign wars I understand that why is everyone so miserable why there's such a high usage

expect to happen you're still civilian dollars worth of why we try not to go to jail I don't understand people commit crimes expect they're going to get away with it\nSo anyway we can talk about more

eight five or four hundred and some of\n\nThe story is called the ugly truth about Tom share everything you've done your family fiber about buying a timeshare you need my help hello I'm shot McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom ... the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what are you my timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your families now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de calm office now I guarantee you if we can't catcher timeshare contract you'll pay nothing\nHappened never happened before and when you hear idiots\nOn CNN like Don lemonade saying it you can call them a mob and there's nothing wrong with this kind of action we have now moved into a new world in America when the left like as you start with Eric Holder former chief law enforcement officer in America saying when they go low we kick them I never heard anything like this\nYou don't even hear that from radicals I mean this is really bizarre and for him to say that and to incite that kind of violence against people\nUm you know we have Steve Sebelius took a bullet you had Rand Paul who was attacked from behind on a cowardly or attack on his back while leaders mowing his own lawn you have the the kind of things that my daughter has experienced Pam Bondi in Florida has experienced that Ted Cruz and his wife\nHad happened that Kirstjen Nielsen that the H a secretary and Mitch McConnell has hats\nThat's a curse Nielsen that the H a secretary and Mitch McConnell has passed I mean this is getting out of control this is no longer an isolated incident and it's carried out by people who are so lunatics that they try to scratch through at Thirteen tongue barn store at the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way\nThis is Petra once a\nWhile but Governor Huckabee it's coming from the top there actually telling them it's OK to become unhinged and violent you got to Hillary Clinton saying we don't need civility until we are in power again and we take the power away from them so it's not coming out of a vacuum it's coming from the top down\nAnd I think someone needs to say to them cool it because you know what I Know when mass hysteria gets out of control it doesn't limited to one side of the aisle\nWell and and I do worry and I hope that the people on the conservative side will maintain a sense of\nDecorum we can be passionate we can be a very strong as folk and but we should never take A People's freedom and liberty from them and that's what you do when you go to a place where they're having a restaurant meal or when they're at their homes or when they're trying to enjoy a movie\n... and when you take their liberty from them that's not American Michael that's not what we're about we're about green disagreeing and the right way and the right place at the right time\nOr what we don't go and hound people try to get them out of business and that's what these loans are doing\nWell okay so the question becomes how do we stop it pie I spent half of show yesterday Governor Huckabee speaking to attorneys who are actually representing people who've defended themselves in restaurants against these left wing mobs is not an easy question because there are limits to what you can do to defend yourself but on the other hand we can't run away just because they want us to run away\nAnd that's the topic for another day we're talking about this issue but for a few seconds talk about the mid term elections I personally believe Governor Huckabee that violence I've been to quote new Democratic Party has Eric Holder calls them things actually saying this is the new Democratic Party we kick them when they're down\nBut I actually think that this is going to alienate the vast\nMiddle ground who are going to move over to the Republican side and it's going to have the the help to effect that the radicals wanted to have that even Hillary Clinton thinks it's going to have what do you think I totally\nAgree because there are a lot of people who are Democrats are people who think left of center or who are unabashed liberal decent human beings and they're not hateful people and they're they're not learning turns or they do have some sense of personal responsibility and they don't want to see people get hurt and injured\nAnd there's a whole move on to walk away movement interestingly started by young and I had on my show I'm Brandon ... who it is interesting New York\nOr activists or he sees gay it probably is the last person to people think would be on my show we hit it off grade we had a terrific can counter\nOn that he has been a long term Democrat and he's sick of this stuff and he was leading a movement called walk away and people can go to the face of pages said in their houses are people who are\nTruly you know liberal but they're no longer going to support the Democratic party because they feel like it's gone off the deep end and they no longer can associate themselves or something there's lie to them and that has a encourage people to be violent\nAnd uh and and to destroy people's personal liberty but\nGovernor governor can be you are a media star you're also a musician you're also a devout Christian and the Christian teaching say that you should turn the other cheek but that doesn't mean turn the other cheek forever does it\nWill turn the other cheek does not mean that you're a ... I think people you know say bless me me does not mean week the word ... comes from a word and it means strengths fraud under subjects and it's the same or get what they used to speak up domesticating horse which\nDoesn't mean you make the horse leak it means you channel his strengths and his energy and Jesus said blindsided him equally saying has blessed are those who keep their strength to have power but his channel it in a way that it's constructed so this idea that Christians are just push rovers and that we sit back and take it in a chance\nOn you know that's not true we're going to stand up for justice for what's right\nI think it's more of an appropriate for people who are believers not to be angry and not to try to seek revenge but to try to see justice and justice is not being served when people are white about when they're accused falsely through things that are incredibly horrible things that happened that human beings\nAnd it is the\nAbsolute imperative for true people face to fight against those injustices so anybody who thinks that that didn't even get like a world is going to sit back and just\nAct like it's okay to be Savage rabbits and destroy boy are they ever law\nWell the next step is going to be what happened in the in the old days in other words if we don't stop these left wing mobs they will go with the churches and upset sermons and knocked over all there is we can't permit this\nAnd I think that we we people a belief we people of traditional values have to understand that self defense is the only kind of defense there is at the end of the day but I don't want to get into that right now I Want to stick to the positive and\nWe'll go back again to the politics of the day the country moving so far away even from the Democratic party moving into the\nStreet violence of the communist movements I Believe politically is going to have a uh uh the opposite effect in the midterms I think you just agreed with me correct\nAbsolutely I I Do feel that\nThis is a blue wave ah is is maybe grossly over estimated I think we're going to see a huge turnout from Republicans and conservatives who are beginning to wake up that this is no time to sleep\nThat after we saw what happened the Kavanaugh hearings the attempt ... ah just destroyed the processes and Michael when it comes down to it let's be real clear\nWhat it states here is whether or not we have a system of government in which we decide things by election not by tantrums\nAnd the reason we're having all these issues is because the Democrats have refused to accept the results of the twenty sixteen elections and we lasted that way with it if we reward them for their bad behavior you get more of it\nIs the same thing when you raise your child or train it off and then you reward you get more out the behavior the consequence you get less ... editor of the Petra lumps this spring the yelling the violence the attacks physically and otherwise the lines at a struck fitness\nWe cannot rewarded we've got to go out when elections and what you're talking about earlier there has to be the legal consequences for people who engage in the south absolutely\nA hundred percent or so\nAnd and again Governor Huckabee I I I'm admirer the work you're doing on the television I look forward to being with you later on in the day and it'll be on this weekend given the audience please
