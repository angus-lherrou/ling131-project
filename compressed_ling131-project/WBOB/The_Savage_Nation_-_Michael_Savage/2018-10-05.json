junkies drugs to use can you believe this what else happened in the ... republic that is akin to what's happening in America today weekend police authority\nRampant lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated what else happened couldn't buy firearms people were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash that's what I'm Talking about the backlash to this liberalism arose\nRight now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards you put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street\nAttacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity but we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with the communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards\nNow don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember what I said many times those that do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing what do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world of where this will lead\nAnd I see what this really so I'll go on so just like on the far today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the kiss of today and gone by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they were attacking the Republicans now senators\nNo one stops them\nIt's as though we're powerless to protect ourselves from these ... so the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one\nAlong with tremendous money from the aristocracy that we're still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany and they formed units called brown shirts\nAnd they started beating up communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen here don't condemn what I Am saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you to be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story biggest this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on\nCNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shorts some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown\nShirts but what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up an opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing did you and I sent\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong cost the left with like you to think he's at least the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader he had some solutions\nBut his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass those liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you\nWill see there will be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point to my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country and we have a charismatic leader but its solutions are not yet that extreme the left\nWould say any of us illusions of extreme ... the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much beyond what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what a jury Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat do you do he drank mounted shepherds drank too much about ... ... what do you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy I went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an operation\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around in cycles show when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left than it's super liberalism\nIs a good thing for this country and the west you're a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring\nAbout trust me on that gee this is what triggers at all if we have an economic blowout\nIn the west a a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nAnd things will happen to you can't believe are happening and what happened so fast she'll say it's not happening and liberalism will be there was the reason for it you say it can happen here well it will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nIt will happen here and the economic downturn that as being predicted by some\nEconomists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're in a heightened now of the stock market the inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\n... printing money and under the Democrats when we criticize deficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you but on you or anyone in the radio talking about the run away in the ... the excuse me the uh\nThe deficit no not one person they all want to go in there and get the uh the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printed money this is crazy because someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever you want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as happened in why mark Germany at the end just before all of this\nThat or take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how fabulous the money I become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not removed the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will you'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by enemies of Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views and I pray that as I ride on page three ... three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the one strike United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we will sink even deeper and we may well do it without hysteria\nBecause Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to dispirited to fight back page three oh three stop mass hysteria be right back\nEnjoying the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred and Savage eight by four hundred seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by switched America
