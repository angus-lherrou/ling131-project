the cop has been the ...\n... on a racial level committing a hate crime with a cop sitting by on a motorcycle because the ... has been the bald by the communist mayor of Portland, Oregon what can you actually do if you are confronted in a restaurant or on the street you actually have tremendous rights to defend yourself\nAnd I'm going to have Dan Horowitz lawyer Supreme on the show to take your calls because I think this is the point where at if we're hearing Eric Holder saying the Democrat Party is a party to catch people well you got to know what to do if someone kicks you see that simple Mike I'm WABC you have an opinion go ahead please\nHey mark how are you a long time listener first time caller I'm I'm a retired cop in New York say for over Twenty years and believe it or not yes they do have rights\nI'm the crime that's committed against them as aggravated harassment at the leaf and you have every right to protect yourself again\nOr let's say let's say a guy and his wife is sitting in a restaurant and the way that with the earrings goals as friends and they come over and start harassing them at the table first of all the restaurant is liable for not having kept them out that's number one number two what if they actually start screaming at him and spinning out I'm at the table what can you do\nFor spending is considered an assault\nSo at that point they can do whatever they have to do to protect themselves\nOkay I always live by a fire or when I was a police officer I live by a five foot role you can do whatever you want to say whatever you want within five feet on may ... that five foot rural all bets are off you know at that\nPart so let's say you're out with your wife in a restaurant in New York somewhere queens wherever you are and somehow they know you're an ex cop and they want to harass you and they come screaming you calling him names and you say good within five feet to what you want but now they get close to the table and start shouting at you and your wife and your wife gets scared what do you do\nThat sort of immediate fear of life at that point I Do what I have to do and that's and that's what anybody anybody wants to do you have the fear of life can protect yourself and this is at certain books you can protect yourself\nAnd do what you have to do to protect life\nWell my at my attorney will be on shortly and I have in my hands the California criminal jury instructions he gave me the jury instructions on the right to self defense of defensive another none homicidal it's amazing how broad our rights really are to defend ourselves against these left wing thugs\nReally amazing we have tremendous ability to defend ourselves and what the problem here is that the media has made us so crazy that most people are intimidated to defend themselves\nUnfortunately it's called Obama hypnotized information for eight years\nYes and look at that Eric Holder who he was always a piece of garbage he came out and said this is the new Democratic Party we kick he always was a thug here was the chief law enforcement officer America who almost had a mob burned down Ferguson, Missouri and now he's telling Americans get ready because we're going to kick you\nRight there he's already telling somebody to go and commit a crime or kicking somebody believe it or not Michael is aggravated harassment [laughter] that is a misdemeanor he's already tell NPR\nI look I Know what's going on and I want to stop the man this before it gets worse I Want to stop the mass hysteria and I'm sending you a copy of the book\nGod Bless you for being a surviving all those years in New York on the streets but you know something my friend none of us are immune to what's coming Hillary holder at all want violence in this country we should avoid it at all costs but if it comes to your doorstep what do you do when I return enjoy\nThose Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred and Seventy eight five four hundred and seven to eight

it all the news around and finding the right talent the noise of reps from job sites with one size fits all products you don't need in the unqualified kid is filling up your inbox monsters just smart people getting to know your business and giving you a simple personalized solutions for a fair price\nI Believe that that's very close to a threat of deadly force because if they get you out of the car the same weapons that they use the same gang mentality that they use that can lead to either death or serious injury I think you can use lethal force in that situation [noise]\nAnd you know if I told you the anger motorcycle people were angry at a car pulled the car over banging on the windows and the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody to do good you got the gas\nAnd the driver pulled out a gun and shot a bunch of them everybody would go good you got the gangbangers you know you got the motorcycle gang here we have a ... a double standard because they're quote protests are ...\nAre there any cases that you've tried in in this arena I mean that I that would be a ... of our question\nI had a case where a guy was being rude to somebody's life for the man knock knock on his butt and he my client was and put on trial for documenting the bully on his butt and the jury acquitted 'em and later on one of them went up to me and said you know he was technically guilty but we didn't care the guy got what is\nThe only one I've done\nSo I Know are you saying that a person can defend themselves yeah for it if there if\n... if they if you have to be calm when you do what you have to be professional you can't be acting at your own anger yeah that's it if it's got to be in the realm of what any normal person would do would share what\nIf the guy as I say is over six the and the mob is people in their twenties and thirties ... there's no equal forced to that\nNo I think that people whose cars were seriously ... particularly the scene where the cars being pushed the guy is leaning against is trying to stop it and they're swarming the car on that one and the one where the guy got out of the car in both those instances I think deadly force was on the table\nBut we're not recommending deadly force on this radio show and I will I Will caution everyone listening to the following\nI'm a very smart woman said to me once that you want to know that person for the rest of your life you know there are do you want to be right or do you want to be smart you can be right and wind up in court for ten years for you could be smart and and try to get away in any way you can I think that's what we're talking about here as well then isn't it\nWell I [noise] you know that in a fight even if you're trained martial artist you will sometimes lose so even if you're right and even if you think you can win if you can be safe and not have to hurt somebody that's better\nUm but at the same time I don't like the idea that you have to stand down and ... you know this is a whole history I mean I was reading stop mass hysteria\nAnd you're talking about the fifties and the communist attacks and the U.S against them and if you don't stand up to this type of fascism [noise]\nYou know whether it's Maxine Waters which is the person inside it at the beginning of the book or these groups on the streets math mimicking terror groups or\nFrom the past what what's going to happen at some point people have to stand up\nAnd that's the that's the bottom line if we don't stand up we'll all fall down right\nNow they just don't keep going they'll keep going until they take over every institution in the country as they almost have already done the universities are gone most police departments have been infiltrated and taken over by left wing fanatics has you know and cops who want to do the right thing are afraid to do the right thing\nFor example in Portland we saw a police officer sitting on his motorcycle doing nothing ... why do you think that was\nA I think he to me he looked angry I bet his superiors instructor him\nStand down unless something actually erupted and I think he was just sitting there going this really stinks\nBecause the problem with that approach is that the attackers these rioters cut it anytime lose it and attack somebody for somebody getting out of their car or in the car could lose his temper or be scared and then the violence has already happened and then the officers respond it's too late\nPreemption is the key to preventing violence we know that\n... for Dan what's the bottom line you're in an election no data her what year in a restaurant\nAnd you're actually a guy who's very fair minded in politically I think just somewhat liberal by the way which is your business you know it's OK yeah you don't have to disguise yourself in any way I Know where you are in some ways\nI also know that I Know that you come from a family of of heroes that I Know for a fact\nAnd can I say anything about that or not\nYou can you can talk about I thought about that today how would my\nBus so proud of his father who's in his nineties who fought his way from the beaches of Normandy to to um to um I think Berlin in World War two you also lost your uncle the new\nI yes he took himself out of a hospital bed to fight in the battle of the bulge and died so\nDamn comes from fighters then does not like to retreat when people threatened him\nI've seen them in action and the courts so Dan I'm going to ask you a ... you're in a restaurant with me now okay I'm with you and they recognize me and I had my book out stop mass hysteria and we're reading from it and some waiters she's just doing it and he checked his friends to come and harass us they come to the table and start yelling screaming what do we do\nI mean I thought about that because you were talking about that earlier and I was actually thinking of a particular restaurant where we were at where we worried about something like that happening\nI Would pick up a knife and disguise it in my hand and up because I'm not going to get hit sitting down\nAnd I would politely ask for him to leave and if we had to I Would suggest we leave although going out on the street is dangerous I Would look to other people in in the restaurant to join in and protect us including\nThey won't know nobody will do that they'll look the other way I Know that for a fact\nProbably but if need be that nice kind of go where it needs to go to protect me I'm not going to take any physical violence from somebody who was attacking me\nMm [noise]\nWell now you know why that as my attorney\n[noise] you\nKnow he was an African he brings in that when I saw like ... then brings in that into a knife fight\n\nAt all I'm going to take a couple of calls because this is not a joke in question I have a number of people calling on this issue by the way including defense attorneys\nAre on this stuff actually can I grab this call right now while Dan is on the line is there a way to do that if you pulled up from a gym can you pull a blind for out of ... in Reno go ahead pull up line for\nFor\nYes line for please go ahead quickly\nForget [noise]\nWhat's

trying to get to switch to come out it malfunctioned finally somebody made a ruckus screened and and he took off I went and contacted the Alameda County sheriff department they did a phenomenal job they had him detained interested with and you know a couple of minutes\nOr was he charged with a crime\nHe was there was an outstanding felony I think one of them as terrorists charges stillborn through some of the court system and climate area hearings\nAnd who's defending him the ACLU so\nUm he's actually I Do I Do not know his lawyers no no it's a private lawyer and the sad thing about it

the way they should not have been shouldn't happen\nNumber one but I Would wish that there was a secret service agent or would have prevented the rapper from grabbing the president's I'd look at the president's face in the picture he's extremely shocked he's horrified by the way that the guy got so close to him do you understand how dangerous this is what a per say oh I'm wrong look at the picture\nI grabbed a screen shot up without having to put a areas wrap it violates Secret Service protocols that's on Michael Savage dot com and if you think I'm wrong look at the president's face he shocked\nHe shot the man's got him in a hug where he's got his left arm over the president's ah left shoulder he's got his right arm holding the president's right hand the president really backwards from him\nAnd they're cutting us making the big asteroid himself again smirking to the cameras using that President as a marketing tool do understand that\nWell if you don't understand them and help you try to understand that this was a public relations disaster and what is he going to get ... votes from it\nYou know on Monday I'm going to have a diamond in silk on the show again because then the movie is coming out\nI'd be very curious where they think about this because this goes way beyond the optics of the picture this goes to a breakdown in our society it almost every level nobody seems to have any values left no one seems to know what's right or wrong no one seems north\nKnows the difference between north and south no one has any dignity wherever you're turning everything's breaking down from top to bottom that's that's that's my opinion that's my opinion Rosie Rosie on line three you disagree with oh please you're on the air\n[noise] yes Hi I'm calling every ... kinda than on the part that practice for the the fact that I see as a member is coming in any part of the United states I don't I don't know\nFor some it was a way it was so it was a garbage man\nAnd so they can be ah not\nReally so it was a garbage man is a right to be in the oval office\nThe president if he\nWhat if what if the president invited a pornographer in there who had a big big following what probably well a pornographer pornographic websites are amongst the biggest websites and the country would it be right for the president to invite the head of a pornography website in you know if I don't touch the west is nothing but a pornographer with an instrument\nFriendly fire\nThanks for going with me I've been waiting for that to all my life none of ... you don't understand this was pushed down a by someone else in there who got it all wrong and I don't think the president's going to gain any votes from it I think he's gonna he's not going to lose any votes but he's going to have a lot of people walk away feeling sick\nBecause if we're defending him and defending American values aboard his language and culture what you could argue that rap music is part of American culture you'd be right in saying that but I Would say it's in the wrong direction it's taking America in the wrong direction of culture\nAh and I don't care about race it all going to make and racial go ahead and make it whatever you want because that's all that's on your mind I Would say this if it was a a person of any any any race and if\nHe wanted to have some one of the arts in there with a large following there are other choices besides a rapper whose lyrics are disgusting disgusting do you think that I'm Alone in my opinion maybe on the first thing the only want to say it today but I can guarantee\nI'm Alone in my opinion maybe on the first and they only want to say it today but I can guarantee you won't be the last look at the lyrics of this rapper\nI Can't even read them on the air I Need you I Want you come to me ecstasy ecstasy ecstasy ... or ... ... ... ecstasy she pushes drugs he pushes group sex he pushes everything you could imagine\nThat we don't stand for that's the message you think belongs in the oval office\nI can read more lyrics if you want but I'm not going to do it on the air they're all disgusting lyrics\nAnd this is an example of the the the collapse of American civilization\nAnd by the way I felt the same way when his darling wife was in the last few months ago or the other one zero nobody an uneducated piece of a waste of human DNA human DNA was brought into human DNA a waste of human DNA excuse me\nNothing but surgery a a surgical textbook in high heels was brought in and I'm supposed to sit here like a moron and say how wonderful they brought in the wife of the rap and now he brings in the rapper whose that's why I got a pornographer bringing a pornographer after all as some of these sites are doing their enormous\nWhy does he just sick the guy from the desert who has a uh all of the ... the um houses a prostitution in the desert that guy dentist whatever his name as after all he's running as a Republican why not have them in there and give them a hug aside hug\nWhat's that guy's name in with the with the uh the Brussels out there in the desert of Nevada said that he represents the American culture to you could have him in you know why not\nHave a brothel owner I have a pornographer and they may bring in six votes each you never know but I Would think that having had a guy who runs like one of the major porn sites would be very smart politically thing of all the people addicted to pornography will vote for Trump after that\nLess the same thinking as having this guy in there at least that's my opinion I'm running short a time
