P. M. E. X. A. P. M. E. X. they don't even know I Am so you don't have to say oh dance studios I mean I don't know why I've been recommending them for years I bought things are gold and silver from them\nFrom time to time over the years uh I really like their Web site at ... dot com\nUm that that is where who is Richard Richard from Louisiana asked me that that's I mean I Would go there they here's what I like about a number one you don't have to deal with anybody because some of these gold and silver guy I mean they're predators their predators\nAnd ah it ... it drives me crazy but here's the thing you get to see you on the website how much something's going across to where it is and you get to see what they're buying it for as well so you kind of get an idea of just spray it and the commission's at all that and I like that so\nI Would check 'em out I Know you're saying well I don't want to buy my gold or silver from from a website well I'm just I'm just telling you I'm they send it to you in the mail I have used them\nI don't know how many a lot of times over the last ten years Fifteen Years I guess I'm so I just I only recommend them because\nI trust them because I Know they're trustworthy so anyway a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three during the to your car right now [noise] well it's October forced to some of you joining us here for the third our\nFor um this third our shirt or appreciated and let's just take a quick look I think we kind of a shooter need you but let's just take a look at markets and we see the Dow down three quarters of one percent\nThree quarters of one percent right now the S P is down by half a one percent the NASDAQ um that's the big loser of the day so far\nAs technologies of and get clobbered and continue to and I think they will I don't want to say they will continue to get clobbered we're going to be a turning down we're probably for the rest of the year\nAnd I'm looking at the NASDAQ down about one point one percent right now so that's a pretty significant move\nNo matter how you shake it [noise] so\nThat's where we are right now or in the markets the one thing that I did want to look at it was an oil and we've got to continue to watch oil and you know the national um\nA price of gasoline that palm has been going up almost on a daily basis yesterday it went up I don't know where it is today yesterday was a two eighty eight a gallon\nSo maybe I'll get a look at that here before the end of this hour but but uh uh get a oil sitting at Seventy five sixty five um eight million barrels of crude oil added to end the stories\nThis week or last week eight million barrels that's ah they were expecting two and a half million\nSo needless to say there's a huge jump\nThat should be some reason to see oil pulling back a little bit Brent Crude oil still over eighty five dollars a barrel of Russia Saudi Arabia Middle Eastern countries are dancing in the streets I'm sure this is very very good for them\nOr this all because of sanctions so they say all because of sanctions on Iran so they've got to pick up production and meet the short fall from Iranian oil and the other scientists don't take place until November first by\nUm the majority of ... countries that have been buying oil from Iran of already stopped matter of fact Japan is down to zero so they're cutting back they want to make sure they're ahead of November first they don't want to get caught buying any oil\nThe economy yes if you said the election I'm sure you probably did so yeah so\nYou may want to wait may want to wait for another month and bite after the election I didn't wait I'm not going to wait I'm going to get it you know I'm I'm a just looking at it and yes it is we're well it's not out of fifty two with low but it's very very close actually it hit a fifty two\nWeeks ago already but I think it's come off of that I'm so no\nNo yeah it's it's off that fifty two weeks ... barely so I mean it's a it's sort of great price of talk about valuation holy mackerel\nBy the way it's a thirty billion dollar company an evaluation it was very very good right now there's not too many value stocks out there this is one of them so I Would absolutely a\nWants to see you consider adding to it somebody else Harris is asking me I own they're saying I own a MA thirty six are also seems like a good sign device years where I just answer that question yeah regional plan was to wait until\nA weight on any new traits until the election um\nYeah but I I I wouldn't wait I mean I ... I I'm just telling you I'm sharing with you what I did personally just as a disclaimer my IRA camp I've I've got to wait I mean it's a it's a great price I'm Glad to be getting it at the city too weak although I'm I feel I feel good about it a singer is saying the damn park their money in the twenty\nUm has been as drops in her interest rates will cause that ah that fund to drop a little bit and ... as\nOr should I Move it into a CD I we always say under it really depends on what you're going to do with it and what you're thinking about that um you know if it's long term money um I don't know that I Would be to offer concerned\nAbout it tried to replace it um you know into CDs but at the same time if you do that and um for the next couple of years you're probably going to get a little bit of a better return\nBut I don't know that I can say that over two years but I Will say over the next six months of the next two years even eight months you're probably going to get a little bit of a better return so I don't have a problem with that look this is this is treated pretty much cash\nI'm perfectly fine my number one first priority option for any kind of cash is a CD\nThe reason that particular mutual fund is on my list as I have ... as I said in the description of that particular stock that it's really there for tracking more than it is anything else not it's not a by is there for tracking\nIt to the air so that you can use it\nAs a way to track your cash because to share value remains at one dollar so if you have cash in a CD or at least you can put it in your tracker if you are prime partner you're using the tracker uh that's the main reason\nFor being there but you you know it's fine there's nothing wrong with there's nothing wrong with ... is a big will be responsible I'm but\nI'm I'm a I'm OK either way and I don't think it's a bad idea to move it to CDs I don't want you to take a loss on it that's the only problem I'd rather wait it out if you if you have a loss or you've just seen the\nPayout go down a little bit let me go to Tim Timothy in Michigan hate Timothy\nHello Yes sir\nI'm ... years old man man I've been at all what you read and my own or\nThat's all that came on\nOur costs and rhino problem of course then you can read what type of business would you prefer to lick and crude term ...\nI guess uh I I Would I Would want you I'm Timothy to think about probably some good solid\nYou know a stock of some good solid technologies technology company so I mean I Would look at now if you're looking if if you've got a little bit of money\nThat you can set aside for the long term something that you can you're saying to yourself man I all I Know is when um whatever fifty I Want to you know I Want my money to be growing and I'm going to have you know I'm going to be getting set for retirement so and so forth\nI mean that's how you have to look at is really really hard\nOr your first of all you you want to open an account of Robin Hood\nRobin Hood is a great place to get started because it doesn't cost you anything so you can buy ... shares of stock you can buy five hundred shares of the stock and it's not going to cost you anything\nNo no no fees and it's a great place to start but let me get let me tell you something Timothy and I I I'm I'm a really sincere about this if you if\nI'm I'm really sincere about this if you if a twenty three year old person\nIf you're twenty three and you said yourself you know what every pay day I got a little extra money I got you know um I got fifty dollars a month you know ...\nAnd I would just like to put that fifty dollars away in something that I can just forget about it not even pay attention to and you picked a stock\nUp um you know what any sockeye technologies start a in a dusty of stock whatever any kind of stuff you'd pick up a big company though big company stock\nAnd every month you talk and you bought whatever five fifty dollars you're gonna buy of that company so say advised to share you buy to share and you do that every month\nFor between now and the time you retire every ... once a year to share five years ten chairs or whatever it is you do that every month man you have more money when you retire you know what to do I'm I'm Sears you're gonna have more money you know what to do it and you don't but the key is not getting too excited\nWhen it goes down who cares keep buying when it goes up yeah that's good it's up I'm not going to get real excited he by it and you just do that on a regular basis it's a quid lowland just people that I Know that I met over the years that are fifty five sixty years old this started working for\nA company a big company and every week they pay they bought one or two shares of their stock out of their pay and you look at him I said ... and they don't even realize it and here they got a million and a half hours sitting in there I mean it's like it's it's that's what it's equivalent to and it's a great great thing to be thinking about\nNow you know but but you can't if you look at a stock market\nAnd you're thinking man I Want to make some money quick or the ... and being quick I mean in the next couple of years I just want to put some money I Would make some money quick you may you may do it you may do it but\nIt's really hard to do it's really hard to do you might just lose it all too I mean it could go either way so I Would say stick with a good solid company and just every every month just plug away little by little\nAnd put a little bit of money in it and stay disciplined to doing it every month I mean it's got to be like putting gas in your car man every month you're you're you're buying a couple of shares of this company and I'm telling you it'll it'll pay huge huge dividends to you as you as you get older\nOkay okay right right right\nSo give it a shot go to Robin Hood\nOn on your phone you go to ... to have a phone out Robin or whatever they have a computer out and all that and I just get an account open I don't think it cost you anything you can open and then you start start getting some money in there and and investing it\nOkay I Will do with the ...\nAll right thank you Timothy I appreciate it brother I'm Glad you called me thank you God Bless let me go to Marty Marty calling us from Tennessee hey Margie\nGood morning damn good morning I'm apologized first off or if you've already over any of my eyes are it happens all the time 'cause we don't get to see where you where you really miss you don't you know be to be honest I oh yeah but anyway\nUh my first question is we are\nPerformed and bond since February of ... pretty seriously about ten percent at times and with the interest rates rising if they are anticipate do you think that the value of those preferred and bombs will ever come back\nOh well I Can't speak to the bonds I don't know what kind of bond you have or whether it's a bond fund or an individual mine but the preferred you're going to come back we're going to get called at some point in time\nOkay so if you have a preferred\nAnd you pay twenty five dollars for it\nAnd it's down to ten dollars yeah it's going to get cold and you're gonna get your twenty five dollars okay you so if you but if you bought a preferred thinking you're going to try to get some gross yeah then that's a mistake by ... because you got to be doing it for the income\nOr some of the volatility is going to be the upside but you know I Would I Would still consolidates get get start their start with those micro caps and small caps and then see see what that does for you\nOkay any other\nUm now that I'm hope hopefully that I mean do you have more than\nYou have more than ten physicians and then he sat through\nSome doctors I have many ... maybe ... ... oh okay yeah\nOh okay yeah so I tell you that maybe four or five\nSo then the other thing yeah I mean five is five is good and you know I'm for is good I I Would look at you gotta have some duplication and no sector send other words you've got to have some companies\nThat are are doing similar things so\nI Would go through it you know maybe you know once a week take out one of the sectors\nAnd ... and go back and read the description of the company you need to read it on the website or you can read it on a chart to wherever your broker just [noise]\nUm when you're pulled out and say well you know what this company's an oil refinery and this company's oil refinery and this company or fun or you know show oh or this company is um you know ...\nOr

thinking should I don't\nKnow I I think that's I think that's fine I mean I think that's a great strategy as long as\nYou know as long as you're okay paying the tax you know fry conversions I mean that's where you have got to look at and if you're okay doing it little in the long run I think it's going to pay huge dividends where I think it's going to be first of all it's going to give you a great flexibility\nBecause you're not going to reach Seventy and a half and say oh you have to take X amount of dollars I mean you may be taking that anyway but at least it gives you the flexibility\nTo say or you know I won't have to do that and obviously now you're getting dividends if you want you know when you're using the dividends and you're you're fully converted to wear off in a an income you know you're not going to be paying any taxes on that and\nI you know I think that's that's a huge uh you know a huge uh I'm\nA dividend or to not have to pay the taxes so\nAnd and do allow it to grow tax free to allow it to be inherited by somebody else tax rate I mean I just just just so much so many advantages there so if you're OK paying the tax I Would start a program by every

don't have to worry about unemployment right now but they've got to worry about inflation\nAnd what else does it mean when you have a three point seven percent unemployment there is something else that has to be happening whether you believe it or not it's got to be happening what is it it's that the economy is really good\nListen you don't get a three point seven percent unemployment rate uh forty nine year low you don't get wages going up we've our wages up about two point eight ...\nI'm Sorry to point seven percent right now it's a very good it's better than we've seen a long time and chances are we're gonna have GDP Growth\nOver three percent none of that happens unless you have a thriving economy\nSo the Federal Reserve now has got to start thinking you know what I wasn't going to raise rates in December but I Need to rethink that a little bit so the markets are reacting to this and then negative way and that is the reason\nSo we have the down down right now in this October fifth\nOf the details down just under half of one percent ... percent to relatively benign to say the lease but nonetheless it's a negative territory and that's why\nThe NASDAQ down\nYeah that's awesome man that just so relax I've never had that that feeling before being on the market now the stock that I put in there to IT twenty nine thirty that's a great field it's the only stock I hold in that field and I own some of it and it said it's one year low\nI just like you're saying I Want to add a little bit too even though it's been kind of turning down\nAnd I would tell you now keep in mind and you already know this but I'll I'll I'll say it to other listeners partners IT twenty nine keep in mind it's a micro cap\nSo small company so I don't have to tell you that means is probably going to be a little bit more volatile than than a really you know normal I Would tell you\nFrom a by perspective right now I Would consider that if I if I waited my buys which I don't but I Would consider that a strong by not just to buy\nAll ... very much damn I just want to add to it a little bit and I just want to your boss and me 'cause I really feel good when I get it\n[laughter] well this is a great company and they're doing a they've got some really good things work and so um yeah I Would I Would I wouldn't hesitate it all out into it\nLike you so much have a great day and God

encouraging I mean when you when I hear those things um that it's only by the grace of God and and let me just point this out to everybody listening maybe you're not a partner maybe you're contemplating it and and I suspect rich understands this he knows this\nBut let me just say to all of you it's not just because of me I'm just an instrument I Hope\nOf God but it's because that you develop a portfolio days you know\nNothing in there is grieving in the heart of God nothing's in their gods God's I said my gosh I gave him all this provision and this\nCompany that is investing in is supporting abortion or pornography or game or whatever it is in in God's heart's not being good God God made me think I Know he doesn't know any better but still\nIn the blast scene of peace maybe is a blessing that God is\nGiving when he says surely for those who want army I so I see on her\nOut of a first Samuel chapter to\nMaybe that honor is given a piece\nChapter to maybe that honor is given

confessional can't tolerate can't do it from the government and stuff like that is\nYeah it's a scam Lucy yes\nSo rule of thumb and I say this to all the listeners I'm not just saying the c._e._o. Lucy I'm a rule of thumb is the government and never ever ever does anything by phone or by email never\nIf it was a legitimate it wouldn't be an email wouldn't be a phone call the IRS never does anything by email or phone call so that way when you apply for this when you start getting deeper into the website which I ... I ... I don't want you to do it but if you did\nSomewhere along the line there would be an application see\nOr a um\n[noise] uh you know a start up the er an account fee or something like that somewhere along I may not be a lot of money maybe forty nine dollars maybe twenty nine dollars a it may not be a lot of money\nBut um and then I'm there will be another email that will come they ask you for another fee to something came up in this uh it's all scanned just stay away from it just delete it\nOkay thank you very much [laughter] never let us know it just curious to know it wasn't like the name of you and I thank you for your information\nYou're welcome thank you Lucy I'm Glad your call 'cause you helped a lot of people today thank you All right God Bless okay that's\nA good good stump lately she called and folks just kicked out of mind those ... they're in the government anything related to the government you know we we get from we used to get phone calls from I arrest by the way you're being sued by the IRS if you'd call this number right away we are this is the Irish are being sued\nAnd I always call because I like to mess with them\nSo unfortunately I Can't call back any more 'cause I've used my kids phones I've used evolves from my phones are home phone all the I've used all the things I can and they block of\nAnd so so now when you when I tried to call back the number they could you just disconnects you right away unfortunately so I Can't mess with them anymore which is disappointing 'cause I I Love doing it but um they're the IRS is never um\nThey they never use phones they're not going to use the phone call you can call them\nIf you want to talk to him based on a letter\nThat is from them\nOr in that letter and if you're not calling the too old to area code is not the IRS if you're not calling a I mean a letter has got to be official you know government a letter but and and even that they're scanned mean but you've got to be so careful so hard to discern that I Know that\nA a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three if you want to hear your car or you are welcome to do that aid for for\nSeven o seven fifty five thirty three a four four seven seven fifty five thirty three so Bryan on Facebook\n\nIs saying Dan or fifty years old I have an alley out to New Jersey\nUm once you are probably shouldn't must you know really doesn't matter now you know it's a new Haiti or I Want to roll over five percent a fidelity IRA I was told I Will have to pay an early withdrawal of ten percent fee to the IRS that's not true ah because I'm under fifty\nNine and a half when I when I rode over I thought the fees would be forty dollars on four hundred\nThis is what I can withdraw before I ... a surrender charge per year well you're right you would have surrender charges if there are still surrender charges into the account\nYou're not going to have any penalties if you're rolling that into another guy or a a camp there is you can roll into an IRA camps without any penalties here's the problem\nThe annuity company may send you a ten Ninety nine at the end of the year saying that you made a distribution\nNow you've got to go through all the rigmarole that you need to do that's why I always I always tell people you know to make sure you've got a good paper trail\nYou've got to show the deposit that you made so you've received a check on a you know October fest you deposited into your IRA account on October seven you've got to have that paper trail but it's the aggravation of going through all that\nBut\nYou don't you should never have to pay a burly withdraw penalty of temper saying if you're rolling it back into a another Ira account\nSo very important that that you understand that Bryant now you need to probably talk to somebody at alley on about that or not your agent\nI Would say somebody up there eight hundred number and talked to ... and see what fidelity as to say about uh maybe they can give you some help her insights I'm as to what you're what you're doing there\nSo check that check that out very very important but I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought that up it's really aggravating to me as you probably know because that should not\nThat should not be the case\nSo Tim is asking me with CD rates near four percent\nWhen are they when are they\nGood for retirement income versus preferred stock considering rising rate environment I I Do a you know four percent is better than three percent so if you're in a three percent and you can get for than for is good and it's better than something you

as long as I could to record the show but as of this time at this time Kevin are still not been definitively comes confirmed everybody thinks he's going to get in but it's not they're just yet so I'm going to talk about a couple of other stories um here's a I'm\nHere the recent story this just happened yesterday man charged after toxic letter sent to Trump and other leaders this is from the Associated Press\nI'm now ... you might be thinking well people are sending toxic letters to Trump all the time yes but the word toxic nowadays has kind of a different meaning than it used to and this story is talking about the classic meaning of the word toxic they don't mean toxic as in\nToxic words toxic language\nThey mean actually toxic as in poisonous this guy sent a letter with rice and and uh you make rice and apparently it should even be telling everybody there with um [laughter] something called by grounding up caster beans\nSo this guy I guess I shouldn't say his name because he wants to do the writing and we don't want to promote\nAnybody we don't want to encourage anybody to do this stuff by giving of fame so we're just going to call him an idiot so this idiot how old is the skies thirty nine years old he told investigators he wanted a letter to send a message that we did not elaborate FBI investigator said that\nThey zeroed in on the idiot after finding his return address on at least two of the envelopes according to the plate so this guy says poisonous letters\nOut to leaders of the world including Donald Trump and then put the return address on it obviously this guy just wanted the fame the envelopes that tested positive for rice and also had a note that said quote jak and the missile being stock powder\nI don't even know what that means us attorney John Huber declined to comment on the idiots mental state but said the cases no laughing matter yeah no kidding I mean I guess it's I guess it's funny in hindsight actually when you're dealing with suspected rice and this has nothing to try to deal with [laughter]\nThanks lawyer\nDuring a court hearing on friday the idiot cried as he told the judge that his wife suffers from a spinal condition and he helps her put ... put\nInstead it's wife suffers from a spinal condition and he helps her put ... put her shoes on in the morning he did not enter a plea and as attorney Lynn Donaldson did not immediately return an email message seeking comment I'm sure\nAh the idiot could face up to life in prison if convicted on the biological toxin charge one of five counts and the complain he's also charged with four counts of making threats through the mail which carry ten year sentences\nThose guys really in a deep up the envelopes which were mailed to the president FBI Director Christopher Wray defense secretary Jim Mattis\nAnd the Navy's top officer administered John oh admiral John Richardson\nWere intercepted and no one was hurt the FBI said all of the letters tested positive for rice and\nHe also the idiot told police he also said similar letters to Queen Elizabeth the second Russian President Vladimir ... and the secretary of the Airforce do it's not clear whether those envelopes or one's matching their description has been found\nOh my goodness so they they could still be out there\nAre the cases are supposed to go before the grand jury and idiot could face additional charges at a hearing set for October Eighteen he was arrested on Wednesday\nAnd uh [laughter] he told investigators investigators he had purchased caster beans on ... in case world why our three broke out so he could defend our nation is being held on a twenty five thousand dollar cash only bond\nChristine Ford she didn't call herself Dr Christine Blasey Ford and I think the reason is is because the story might be true she's not actually a doctor of anything according to the state of California is records\nSo you know she wouldn't wanna misrepresent herself in front of Congress like that who who did start calling her that she didn't call herself that who began calling her doctor\nInteresting a very interesting you know the narratives that we are given and that we accept without question or sometimes\nA let's go ahead why don't we go to our favorite ah Yahoo here and let's see what they've got for us live coverage yes I understand there are I didn't have a mental breakdown at twenty two\nI mean should I [noise] is this worth of a story for the week I did have a mental breakdown at twenty to carry nightly record ... recalls mental breakdown of twenty two so she was diagnosed with PATS D I didn't know she serves pie DSD was as far as\nI'm diagnosed with ... D\nWell I mean I guess you don't have to serve that PATS day well let's see what she says here [noise] um [noise] after two thousand to bend it like Beckham the teenage actress was could\nCatapult into stardom with the first film of the pirates of the Caribbean franchise launching the following year and then starting in the ... movie love actually are so she had a string of good movies she says that run was insane\nBut uh\nYou know people from the outside of like whoa hit after hit you know but from the inside all you're hearing is a criticism really and also I was aware that I didn't know what I was doing you know I didn't know my trade I didn't know my craft I knew that there was something that works sometimes but I didn't know how to kind of capture that\nSo she was acting and she doesn't know how she was doing\nHer personal life changed after pirates as the blockbuster hit mater tabloid and paparazzi fodder I didn't handle it well she is explained it was really rude awakening to the world a massage in a God I'd never experienced that level of hatred on a day to day basis\nNightly detailed out paparazzi would scream at our calling her a whore in order to get a reactor photo that would sell\n\nIt was big money to get pictures of women falling apart noting around the same time as Britney Spears breakdown Amy Winehouse as public struggles a third time she felt worthless\n[noise] I mean I I I get\nWe can't we can never know what an actor or actress go through or anybody was famous I look at Donald Trump right the man gets up in the morning you write something on Twitter heck you can even write the nicest thing in the world happy Thanksgiving or something and he gets all of these remarks saying about how he was a terrible person\nYou know how he's plunging though world and the darkness and these awful thing so\nBut I mean it's sort of a choice right I guess that doesn't make it any better for the people are doing it but you can't you just stop being famous as a possible just kind of drop out or something I don't know I don't know you know after a moving\nAnd just kind of drop out or something I don't know I don't know ... after\nA movie and you're like man I Can't handle this hate mail I'm getting and what can you stop reading the hate mail I feel like you might have some degree of control over that\n[noise] um well I Hope she's All right\nSee what else we got Banksy paintings oh this is a great story guys so there's this artist named Banksy okay goes around the world basically nobody knows who he is he's totally anonymous there is some suspicions but nobody actually knows who he is and he makes these paintings well up paying a Banksy paintings sold\nFor one point four million dollars okay\n[laughter] well\nInside of the frame of this painting apparently was built of shredding machine so as soon as the painting was sold the painting the paper of the painting runs itself through the frame of the machine through the shredder [laughter]\nAnd so it's just self destruct I mean is that not the greatest thing ever so I've got all kinds of questions I mean it must have been set up right how can that be done that perfectly\nBut the theory is that there was a remote control inside the machine so as soon as the painting would sell that it would it would it would come out but I mean when somebody open up the framed or to authenticate the picture or [noise]\nI don't know I mean the chances of it happening that's like a a a scheme from a movie right I mean that's just seems so so odd to me nobody what man this famous like super heavy for this little picture\nThat's in here I mean it would then they dated this guy is like a graffiti artist so whenever somebody saw the picture they have to pick it out of the graffiti he made in the sticking it into something to sell so I don't know when do they get there at one point four million back\nI mean where the auction is made as a sale final what if I mean the person ever got to touch and\nSo now who I was at one point four million I have the feeling that was all like a scam or an urban legend I mean there's a YouTube you can see it there's photos of it\nBut I it just seems kind of odd to me I feel like the entire story has not been told yet but isn't that a a great one somebody buys a picture from one point four million dollars and it just self destruct right in front of everybody incredible\nUh Michael ... who's the lawyer for Stormy Daniels\nI as I said that he was going to help out the calving off thing by bringing forth a uh as as a third woman so there was like a Christine for it and then came a another woman Debra mirrors said that Kevin all exposes generals or her while they were college students\nAnd then my club and I had a lady and this lady said that she had been more to more than ten house parties between Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty three were cabin on his friend mark judge were present\nAnd some of those parties she says that Kevin O's funneling grabbing girls without their consent spiking their drinks and basically hosting gang banks\nSo gang rapes I'm now nobody believes that\nAt all Republicans or Democrats nobody believes that and so now they're blaming Avon lady for bringing it totally unbelievable witness and basically taking the Democrats' chances and basically making them look bad [noise] so that's so funny because I feel like they\nThey were kind of pushing for ... to ... actually run as a Democrat and twenty twenty people were like please run save this country and now it looks like the Democrats are really mad at him for this so you know the the the last is continuously turning upon itself\nOver and over again\nI mean when you have phony outrage you have to constantly be upset and really the easiest target or those closest to you or they\nYou know apart from the ... thing you have the the the progressive the progressive Democrats who are to the left of the regular establishment Democrats\nAnd these guys are are in a war with each other you know I mean the civil war and not not a civil war or like our civil war because I was a that was not civil but they're in a bloodless war so far with each other and it's a really interesting to watch\nOut breaking news looks like Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed fifty forty seven the ayes have it or here's Mike Pence with a final tally\nIs not under stone or fifty or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland\nTo be an associate justice of the Supreme Court on the United states is confirmed\n\n\nA motion
