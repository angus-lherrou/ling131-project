we're known as ... swine and I've used this word my ... to describe conservatives who continued to be conservative\nIn secret in this country you understand where that came from\nLet me continue there is good evidence that Columbus who Spanish name was Cristobal cologne was Jewish probably or possibly um around all the evidence is found in the will he signed on march Nineteen fifty no sex\nIn it he

Dreyfuss well Dreyfuss was a French military officer of Jewish descent\nWho was accused of being a spy when he was in the spotlight other officers that conspired to make stuff up about him\nAs a result he was found guilty of treason and center devils violence and the comparisons a of the drivers of fair to cabinet are pretty strong because they haven't stopped\nThe blood libel against Kavanaugh justice the blood libel was kept up in France against Dreyfuss for very long time by the anti Semitic officers so too are the anti Americans in America continuing the blood libel against cabinet as they have against Donald Trump\nAs they have a guest every conservative in the media it's rotating moving field of targets\nAnd counting on my Savage army tomorrow or to go out and really clean up the book stores you know what you're going to head you know would opposition you're going to get as you well know armband on Fox News because they're not fair and balanced there are a cartel\nAnd only their authors and the friends of their authors get on that that word I said they're not obligated to put me on so I've had best sellers without them\nAnd whether or not I have one this time is very important for America and not that important for me I got to make that very clear turn the music off this is so important let's say this book sold millions of copies what would it say it would send a message\nTo the left that not only their books and their followers and their people ... that we count and here's the part that ark say\nOne thing you've got to hand the left as they all stick together that's the one thing is out of hand them and they support each other you take a hack like that guy who was the Watergate guy the guy writes a book and they say it's sold a million copies the first day\nThat means a million of the people who hate America hate Trump went out and bought a book [noise] why is that why did they support each other and why do you sit home and not do it I don't understand that in ... [noise]\nDo you have sun spots in age spots well listen to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen yourself sun spots director\nShe says I Love the Gen yourself sunspots director

elections who are the reason Trump is president never forget that it was a late surge of white\nMiddle class suburban women\nThat swung over the Trump at the end of the election last time that that put him over the finish line and the question is will they come over again and large enough numbers to save America from the communist jogging or or where we start to hear the same thing fascism racism equality\nUh let's see what are the other watch words of the uh hashtags is hashtags that patriarchy racism white privilege or Trump Mueller oh abortion\nMale a male supremacy a you know you know to watch words or the radical left they have they have all of their little characterizations ready to go now Trump has the power to save America and I don't know whether they will pull a trigger on it\nBut remember Obama did Obama had his IRS poll the tax exempt status of conservative organizations he didn't like remember that scandal\nYou know how many of those women in the street with their spontaneously no one does do you know how many organizations were funded by George Soros most every one of the organizations that bust women to attack senators in the hallways to disrupt the hearings every one of them\nWas brought in because they're working for these nonprofits remember that's a job for them that's their job is political agitation\nAnd so they're a nonprofit organizations is supposed to be nonpartisan the IRS could pull the status of their organizations literally overnight with a letter\nAnd their funding will dry up and it has to be done it's as simple as that there are ways that a non violent where you could face these violent people without violence\nAnd I'm afraid that if we don't we're going to have another Kent State probably in this country I sent it to someone over the weekend I don't know if any of your old enough to remember Nineteen Seventy I saved a newspaper from that time it gets uh\nIt was a significant year for many many ways [noise] I'll never forget what happened at Kent State university and the killings at Kent State changed the course of\nAmerican politics you see the radicals were agitated it's an intergenerational group of agitator incident with the old hippies of that time are still alive and they've cultivated an entire generation of new hippies if you want to call them that\nAnd the old hippies and got the mobs in the streets against the Vietnam War against LBJ and they started rioting on the college campus called Kent State\nWell the governor of the state called out the national guard they fixed bayonets and they faced off against the rabble the long haired rabbit was threatened to take down take down the whole campus\nAll the riders didn't stop no one had ever stop them before unfortunately the rest is historically factual and that is somebody amongst the national guard opened fire on them and then others did the little form of mass hysteria by the way and the number of students were shot dead on that campus\nOne of the results of it in addition to the tragedy of the students being shot\nWas that the entire student movement came to a grinding halt\nSuddenly they cut their hair and went home to mommy and took a job and McDonald's there were no longer out there in the streets rioting because they were afraid that they could get shot dead by the national guard\nAnd I'm afraid that this was going to happen if they keep taunting the police if they keep taunting senators if they keep harassing people in restaurants how long is it going to be until a senator who is armed and license to carry\nFeels threatened enough to pull a gun on one of them you think it can happen I told you I was in Washington last April\nOr an end to visit the president while I was invited by my good friend congressman Columbus in from Texas and he he gave me a personal tour of Congress and he\nShowed me a group of marble stairs aback staircase into into the house of representatives that still has blood on the steps and he told me that there was actually a shootout\nIn Congress between a journalist and a congressman\nBecause the journalist has smeared the congressmen over and over and over again\nTaunted them over and over and over again you think it's new today there's in the Eighteen eighties\nWell it turns out that the journalists came to a Congress with a gun in his hand I don't remember his name and shot the congressman dead on the steps and the blood is still there in the steps now I'll give you another example you may not notice but it's it's history that's all and mass hysteria\nAgain those you know the history of those who do not know the history of condemned to repeat it I Hope you learn your history you're not condemned to repeat it\nDo you know that in the early Nineteen fifties\nA group of Puerto Rican nationalist broke into the gallery in the U.S Congress and opened fire on congressman below and killed a number of them did you know that\nAnd so when you see the pain cats or the women's screaming and yelling it's not amusing to me\nIt's a form of violence that must be stopped and the only way to stop them is by passing much stricter laws about who can enter Congress stop at the people's house garbage already we're not living in the in the early days of the founding here where we're now infiltrated were\nInfiltrated they're everywhere they're running the television shows they've infiltrated the university's they've infiltrated the ... the peaceful front groups\nAnd it's only a matter of time into one of these lunatics shoots the senator or congressman and I think that we need to take preemptive action to prevent another massacre in Congress as occurred in the early fifties when a group of Puerto Rican national it's open fire from the galleries on Congress below\nWhat am I the only person in America remembers that story yes\nAm I the only author in America who knows that story I Can't be am I the only broadcaster who knows that story probably and here I Am with stop mass hysteria having to tell you about it because I'm telling you are right now that unless we know our history we are condemned to repeat it be right
