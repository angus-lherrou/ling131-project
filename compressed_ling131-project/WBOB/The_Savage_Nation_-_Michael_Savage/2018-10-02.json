things and evil things and that should be an obvious thing to anyone but apparently the way the narratives being played out but the Democrats are all women up to be believed and they were innocent and pure and all men are evil so you have to destroy the patriarchy\nWhile again let's go back in history in ancient Rome did you know that they're women gladiators what justice bloodthirsty as male gladiators did you know that you didn't know that you know any of that there were female gladiators what justice bloodthirsty\nYou know any of that there were female gladiators what justice bloodthirsty as a male gladiators they love and blood they love the blood sport and so that we see the gladiators in modern times sitting on a committee\nLike an ancient Rome destroying a man cutting up two ribbons in front of the public in the public sits like dummies and doesn't see the blood thirsty ness of these women are they more like Venus the goddess of love and beauty or like a Vulcan the God of fire\nNow who was Venus Venus you know that the first five planets in our solar system are named after Roman gods because Romans casino without a telescope did you do that first five planets named after Roman gods to show the influence of ancient Rome\nSo Venus was the goddess of love and beauty she was the daughter of Jupiter and the on an ocean side ... and Venus was desired as a wife

price because that's a\nAnd you have to look at the real war against women that as being conducted by those who claim to be protecting women\nSo we go back to the Salem witch trials and the hysteria against which is in Salem region was fermented environment of economic uh socio political turmoil does it sound familiar\nWell it'll be familiar to you after you investigate this a little a little bit more [noise] so what was what were the Salem witch trials what happened\nWell the minister of Salem Village was the strict pious Reverend Samuel Paris and he had a son Thomas and two daughters ages eleven and nine in January of sixteen Ninety to the girls began having tantrums or fits as they were called at the time\nOr the girls through objects scream made strange noises and twisted themselves into bizarre positions as with John good witness children in Connecticut\nPositions as with John good witness children in Connecticut\nA doctor was called and once again unable to cure the girls the physician pronounce the element to be demonic in nature well then another local girl eleven year old and putting them began having in a similar fashion a pair of magistrates are demanded that the young lady's name the source of there'll be which meant\nOn February twenty ninth under pressure of the girls identified three women Sarah Osborne an elderly woman living in poverty Sarah Good a pregnant beg a woman and the Paracels Caribbean slave ...\nConveniently unpredictably two of them were among the rabble into that authorities did not want in their town good an Osborn profess their innocence to no avail and so did too but at first\nThose slaves were rare in the region she had been with Reverend Paris for fourteen years and she loved the Paris children for whom she was largely responsible but Paris whipped er into confessing\nPromising to secure her released if she did so the poor woman admitted to the magistrates that quote the devil came to me and been me serve him an added that she was not the only local which wanting to harm the Puritans she also inform them that she had in fact bake they which cake\nFrom Ryan urine with what she gave the family dog just in case the pet was a familiar or help her of a local which what happened next [noise]\nThe three women wore a prison the next day\nDespite his promise Paris bound to political expediency and allow the slave to remain behind bars we late spring before the governor finally convened the special court order and Terminator as soon as the women were imprisoned the Salem authorities other took a program we know all too well the art of distraction pay attention Diane\nIf there were problems between the merchants and farmers if there were challenges to the local theocracy then leaders must create a diversion Diane an event that would dominate what passed for a new cycle of sixteen Ninety two and that was which is right in their midst to too but had said there were others the word spread that they had to be found\nUsing the tactics have Dianne Feinstein and the committee\nTactics of mass hysteria and paranoia Europe had purge itself of tens of thousands of undesirable that way Salem and it's on our own had to do the same\nAs with so many things one can hold the media partly responsible for this hysteria and I give you some examples of how the media was used in that time through books and publications\nAnd so the hysteria gathered force throughout the early spring and the numbers of those accused continue to grow by the end of may more than sixty people were jailed awaiting trial for witchcraft\nThat was when the governor was finally forced to establish a special court of all your and Terminator and what happened then on June tenth that institution Dianne Feinstein hang its first victim Bridget Bishop\nA brass the widows late husband had run and then she was apparently accused of no crime in particular other than that she was a soft target\nThe woman who was known for playing shuffle board and wearing red clothing which was considered to signify sexual yearning prowess well it went on and on and on and what happened\nWell cotton mayor put his agenda ahead of justice she crafted the equivalent of fake news and contributed his own call to arms at the court riding the following\nWe cannot but humbly recommend on to the government the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as we have rented themselves obnoxious according to the direction given in laws have gone and the wholesome statutes of the English nation for the detection of witchcraft\nAnd so what happened was at the peak of the hysteria few citizens regardless of their standing or immune from accusation and they went on and they got one person after another under the Salem witch trials\nAnd so now he's speed forward to today\nAnd I'm reading from a book that I'm sure will become a very popular book in America for many years to come stop mass hysteria\nI Want to make one important point and that's one that you're going to face today and for the next months and years ahead and that's the difference between mass hysteria unjustified concern\nIf for example the public had risen up against cutting them either and his cohorts that would not have been hysteria and twenty Eighteen this is something the mainstream media did not understand\nIf you look back through history history not agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following that for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media what have you believe it as fact it\nIs history and urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nNot in the media will reference nine eleven it's proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they have been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years and that is why I tell you history has a great great teacher\nWere going through a form of mass and easier which is not a myth\nMass amnesia is not a myth\nIs a conspiracy of sorts a vaguely

Bernie Sanders discovered with his pie in the sky promises during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises of free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another tack\nYou have to do their wits but tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine and what I'm Talking about today is marijuana remember for many many years of marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana but today the exact opposite\nIs being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from Boulder salads houses cancer falling arches arthritis romanticism runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it's insanity a form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug the youth in order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred and Savage eight five or four hundred and seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is sponsored by switched America the only company I trust with my financial future call eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nCyber criminals could attack your laptop tablet or smartphone without warning\nWithout even knowing where they can steal your identity and you may not realize it until it's too late and that's why lifelike identity theft protection now includes the power of a north and security to help\nProtect your identity devices I have both lifelike uses proprietary technology to help protect the range of threats your identity how about your personal info for sale in the dark Web well no security\nDr threats your identity how about your personal info for sale on the dark Web well no security protects against online threats like rap somewhere or malware and if there's a problem lifelike with Norton\nAs agents who will work to fix that no one can preventable identity theft or cybercrime about up to transactions and all businesses but new life walk with ... security provides more detection and more protection against cyber threats\nGo to life lock dot comical wanting their life so I could use prom a coach the average for an additional ten percent off your first year plus you get a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with annual enrollment that's\nLife locked dot com ... coach Savage for ten percent off and a twenty five dollar Amazon gift card lifelike dot com coached average terms apart\nYou wouldn't put a square peg in a round hole so why would you deploy a traditional firewall in a modern decentralized network\nFire walls have new requirements for businesses leveraging fast paced applications and public climbed platforms like a double us Asher and Google Cloud\nWe're in the cloud generation now so you're fire walls have to be engineered to fit right in green claim your client network trying barracuda ... generation network our application firewall free at barracuda dot com slash fire walls hunting\nSeasons here so let me ask you this are you really don't try to squeeze in another year out of that war outlay Davia yours you need to get down to Jacksonville powers more and more you can compare three brands under one roof and take advantage of the great deals on house on can am or players ATVs and side by side\nJacksonville power scores of makeup knowledgeable salespeople well stocked bar department and a service department that fixes 'em right the first time\nSeven seven sixty four Bible that's eight seven seven sixty four Bible [noise]\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one FM W\nTo ...

these allegations are true or false you say well you're engaging in what what am I engaging anything different than what they're doing to the cabinet oh no no I just got this email from someone whose name I Will not read\nAny rights and he lives in San Francisco knows Feinstein he said the speculation that judge Kavanaugh did something inappropriate in high school when he was a minor\nPleased fabulous this recall that Feinstein fully supported a president who was an adult lied under oath had his law license revoked at oral sex with the young intern in the oval office and was accused of rape or sexual misconduct by at least for women\nFeinstein also supported a U.S senator who as an adult drowned the young lady and the drunken stupor and then failed to report the incident for ten hours this is the holier than thou fines thing the crucial fire\nAnd then he throws a real bombshell out there which I didn't know anything about\nFinally on missed finds things ability to forgive or give a second chance please remember that her son in law Rick Mariano the father of her only grandchild was a heroin addict as an adult I'm told that her daughter Catherine met him when he wasn't a glance history program now I Can't confirm any of these statements\nI Can't deny any of these statements but I Believe that America is now looking very carefully at the accusers of cabin or and saying hey wait a minute now you're bringing up women who are making stuff up\nAs we can see this is just a a scandalous hit piece on this man and so therefore let's see if any of this stuff is real I don't know I have no way to confirm or deny any of these things but we're going to keep going until eventually went off the air\nOkay it's that simple and will be off they believe me I Will be off the you know many of you are listening to me up some huge stations you'll hear me in January you don't know why it's all political you'll hear other reasons but it's not no other reason to all political\nAnd I'll tell you more about that come January but right now will continue with what we're doing on the Savage Nation let's not get ahead of ourselves\nWhat else do you have on who now I don't know if we should even run some of these because I don't know whether they're here or there but let's go to Yvonne ... von what's your point\nYou might find as I Know lots\nOf the people down and the fact that he was on the phone from San Francisco and the half hour by making him the head of housing authority\nAnd so he was able to give its members houses and then have them to vote for police to vote for and the also um [noise] what happened was he left San Francisco guy\nDown the welfare checks from their members that was went out with that with him\nWhere she helped to make sure that welfare checks went to the auto where he moved to people in the Jim Jones cult\nHoliday say they all want to get in their tax over there that's\nInteresting [noise] and all for the patronage and the support well is there any more to this because I'm coming back to this lady from Oakland in a minute on the Savage Nation joy ... Coleman oh eight five or four hundred and seven eight five four hundred and seven to eight to\nThis story is called the ugly truth about time share everything you've done your family if I were ... by a timeshare you need my help hello I'm ... now CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what are you my timeshare you gave them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de calm office now I guarantee if we can't cancer timeshare contract you'll pay nothing\nThese of the tactics of the Nazis in Germany and the Soviets in Russia\nI used to think we're a nation of laws and that with defamation libel laws you couldn't get away with this but then I woke up and found out that the senators are above the law movies have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abusive power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know it would you call it abuse of power jackass feel was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of information and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for forty years about McCarthyism and McCarthy on now actually worse than senator McCarthy ever was at its height\nBecause as I point out and stop mass hysteria McCarthy was actually right when he accused all of those members of Hollywood and the media\nAnd of academia of working with the Soviet Union he was denounced as a crackpot even though he had been a war hero they made a mockery of him show you how smart the left is they took senator McCarthy who had been a tail gunner in World War two one of the most dangerous of all positions\nThink of it a glass bubble in the back of a bummer with machine guns facing enemy fighters he survived all that he came out a war hero became a U.S senator\nThe vermin on the left called him tail gunner Joe as if that was something to mock rather than salute but that was just the beginning they said he was a drunk they said he made it all up well they destroyed the man he died a hopelessly broken man\nWhat they did to McCarthy is what they're doing to cabin or and then you want to get in a way of the left wing failings that has destroyed America over the last fifty years now we had an election\nAnd we put Donald Trump in power we stopped there juggernaut\nAnd they're fighting to turn it around with every one of his major appointments make no mistake about it this is really a mandate on you I've said this to you before by smearing cabin or their smearing you you could be a black transsexual a woman\nIn Berkeley and you're being smeared if you voted for Trump do you understand that\nYou understand how this works do you understand this marrying you by smearing him\nAnd it's just the beginning and so the only thing we can do is fight back and again I say with the keyboard and a little native intelligence you could probably uncover things about the senators that might just have them running back onto the rocks that they crawled out of the sewers that they live in\nBecause the Internet as a very powerful tool there's a lot of lives on it\nBut somewhere in the midst of their lives they may be some nugget some gold and I invite you the listeners to become the detectives to turn on the committee members who have done this to a decent man I Am never in my life seen anything like this never but again getting back to what McCarthy\nAnd the McCarthyism that the left you still want us about just for a moment\n... years later there was a publication and titled even own a papers V E N O and I wrote about it in one of my previous books\nAnd the va noted papers were written by former KGB agents and they disclose that in fact all of the people named in the committees and the hearings in the fifties by McCarthy Warren fact Soviet operatives or Soviet fellow travelers every last one of them was guilty\nAnd so here we are now watching the equivalent of the quote McCarthyism were warned about taking place right in front of our eyes\nAnd hardly one journalist in the United states of America makes the connection\nIt's a very very sad day but the truth show went out and I do ask you on Tuesday to vote with your credit card\nAnd please get a copy of stop mass hysteria but not just get the book to enrich me because I'm not going to buy a new car I'm asking you to carry at home\nAnd put it on your coffee table because I guarantee you there's someone in your family who doesn't believe a word that you say someone who was ignorant as a door post who knows nothing about history\nWho knows nothing about how the witch trials of Salem are identical to the witch trials of Kavanaugh but they are it's based on the same methods of mass hypnosis and mass hysteria that's just one example there are numerous numerous others and I invite you to take home this ... of information\nIt's not just a polemic it's a history

is history and I give this to you to show you that what we're going through right now\nWhile not related to ancient Rome is related to history in many ways what camel Harris Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nSurely name all of them and the others on the committee are doing today is actually nothing new under the sun\nIt went on in the Soviet Union were all you have to do was denounced someone and their life was ruined it went on in Hitler's Germany or you had to do was renounced someone and their life was ruined and they were in prison if not executed so the new left are actually the new right\nThe new left or the new fascist as many have said but what we are witnessing and the average person certainly see through it\nIs unfounded accusations on not American it all in fact they're very on American which leads me to the house of on American activities committee of the Nineteen fifties\nHow many years where you left this lectured to about a senator McCarthy being a very bad man because she accused in some cases falsely\nPeople in America mainly in the government the media and an academic of being communist or communist sympathizers right and we were told that was a false thing if it gives it ruin lives and McCarthy was set to be a bad man now let's put aside the fact that\nMost of the people that McCarthy out of this communist turned out to be communists as we learn in the Nineteen eighties wouldn't have known a papers were released you'll have to research that even own a papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy Warren fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside\nHow many times have you been lectured by leftist professors that McCarthy was a bad man\nThat McCarthyism which became synonymous with false accusations was an evil thing\nWe wake up and we see that Feinstein is now McCarthy only there's no troops there were allegations we see that every one of them on a committee or the new Soviet ... and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people will shine through all of this mark\nAnd that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved however I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is\nAnd you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat middle of the road is anything but I think the flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says now remember this before we go on\nKavanaugh had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge Iraq Obama had none\nIn fact I said it when Obama became president he could not have passed an FBI background check and being an been an even ordinary FBI agent Obama could not have become an ordinary FBI\nAgent because of his associations with very dangerous leftist including ... and others but\nHe never find signs of passive background I really wonder why we don't have an FBI Jack of all of the new so this is Michael Savage author of soft mass hysteria [noise]\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong and bingo surprise you hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered

agenda masquerading as history which is already get from the media today you would learn that the following\nThat for the last one thousand four hundred years radical Islam has been at war with the world that is not a slam a phobia as the mainstream media would have you believe it is fact it is history and I urge you to read this without the bias I mentioned earlier in this book indoctrination versus truth\nAnd I give you a list going back only forty years for a partial lifting of the atrocities going back to Nineteen Seventy nine and the U.S embassy in Iran was taken over by radical Muslim males and I bring this up because the mass hysteria and our society is running in the opposite direction as well and what do I mean by that\nNone in the media will dare call it by its proper name\nAnd not in the media will reference nine eleven is proper context none in the media will recognize that we are still at war and had been at war because they have been at war with the west for fourteen hundred years and that is why I tell you history as a great great teacher\nWere going through a form of mass and easier which is not a myth\nMass and easier is not a myth\nIs a conspiracy of sorts a vaguely defined plan to undermine the nation mass media it's perpetrators know did a malleable populace as a necessary tool to achieve an agenda\nAnd has burned they sat Bernie Sanders discovered with this pie in the sky promises during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nIf you cannot seduce them with promises of free things and mass hysteria about the other guys you have to take another tack you have to do there which tell them that that means is okay it's harmless it's fine\nAnd what I'm Talking about today is marijuana remember for many many years of marijuana was seen as the evil drugs the most evil drug of all and uh we were subjected to a form of mass\nBrainwashing about the dangers of marijuana but today the exact opposite\nIs being promulgated which is that marijuana is the miracle cure for everything from ... cancer fallen arches arthritis ... runny noses run a year's runny eyes depression it's insanity a form of mass hysteria\nThat is used to drug the youth in order to manipulate them into following the orders of the left\n[noise] so we're living through the new Soviet era in America being promulgated by the Feinstein committee I call it that because she is the senior she keeps saying she's the senior member of the committee\nWell she knows the libel and slander law is in America she knows that there's a difference between libel and slander she knows a defamation can destroy a person forever and yet they're engaging in a form of defamation I have not seen in my entire lifetime in America as an American citizen\nAnd more particularly in the twenty five years I've been in the radio business and there's an author I have never seen such unmitigated um defamation as I'm seeing against cabin or right now\nNow I spent a little time talking about the Salem witch trials from my forthcoming book stop mass hysteria which will be out across America opening big opening wide think of it as a movie that's opening in every theater in America that's the one thing you gotta understand although you won't sitting on Fox News\nFor the reasons I expressed many times it doesn't mean that the films that opening white it's opening wide\nWalmart and Sam's there will be a best seller tables\nBooks and million making those table Barnes and noble every Barnes and noble that America will have it on a new release table from the ninth of October through the twenty second of October and will be on the holiday table from the thirtieth of October through the twelfth of November\nThat's a big deal\nOf course on Amazon at say sponsored placement of headliner and suggested purchase\nSo the publishers doing an amazing job in getting around the boycott of Michael Savage by paying for placement that every book store in America with the exception of the small communist bookstores throughout America where they use a form of censorship or that they're entitled to do to their own detriment\nNow what we're about to do on the show is very risky and very dangerous and I want to caution every one calling that there are libel and slander laws in America that can get me in hot water and get you and hot water\nBut having set up that comedy at all I'm asking anyone in America who lives in the district of these new Soviets\nUh who I've been falsely accusing cabin or with the most astonishing claims I've ever seen in my lifetime first it was remember the rape charges\nBrought up by the psychopath at NBC aired last night by the ... lawyer remember that and then she said she didn't really mean if you live in a district of any of these senators who are quick to destroy a man\nAnd you have something that you feel as a valid piece of their background that is not getting proper attention\nI'm inviting you to air it on the Savage Nation with a copy yet again I'd like you to confirm way you're getting the information from [noise]\nAnd there have been cases of mass hysteria in our own time or that have destroyed people that almost destroyed companies I'll give you one example of a corporate example the contaminated Coca Cola scare of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd that began in Ninety nine when more than a hundred students in Belgium reportedly fell ill after drinking the beverage well the subsequent investigation coupled with some inept PR handling costs Coca Cola a cool two hundred million dollars and several they ban and other European countries\nAnd while examination of the tainted batches did show contamination of bad carbon dioxide in the you know\nTo Belgian scientists speculated that the tainted products yielded to smaller amount to cause real damage and for them the incident was mostly a case of mass hysteria fueled in part by a prior scare of mad cow disease and dioxins tainted animal products\nA separate investigation by Belgium is high hygiene council in March of two thousand corroborated those claims and said that most of the victims experienced a mass psycho Jenike illness just as we're experiencing today in America a form of mass hysteria with these ...\nJust as we're experiencing today in America a form of mass hysteria with these trials of cabin on okay there are many cases of mass hysteria in our past but they've never in my lifetime been primarily get hit by a panel of left wing fanatical Soviet era US Senator\nOkay we'll be back in a few minutes on a Savage
