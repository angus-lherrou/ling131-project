candidate for this is beyond\nComprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist and or this or that that didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared he's not qualified to be in the spring court ladies and gentlemen the Savage jury let me ask you something if you had been\nPublicly excoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there like a moron you wouldn't have gotten angry\nWhat what do you want out of a human being and find a way what do you think the temperament as of Ruth Bader Ginsburg behind closed doors you think she doesn't scream and yell at people you think that which is not used to temper tantrums for the day they\nForces that are on the American public are you joking you're telling me that the man of overreact you're overreacting you imagine if it was me what I Would have said to them I wouldn't have sat there and take it uh I Would have shown that when the temperature is I Wonder expose them for what they're vulnerable with I wouldn't have sat there and taking that if they ... me and my family to shreds [noise]\n\nThis story is called the ugly truth about timeshare rethink you've done your family if I were ... by a timeshare you name ... hello I'm shot McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancel their timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what do you mind timeshare you gave them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment face sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your family is now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to de calm office now I guarantee if we can't catcher timeshare contract you'll pay nothing\nOf the media you mistaken every poll I don't care which side of the pilots conducted by shows the same thing\nThe respect or the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion the average person's opinion of Congress is it an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in the New York sewer\nPeople hate the media and last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about the ... republic which was so degenerate that the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler\nIt was only a small fringe that put Hitler forward the middle class German was repulsed by Hitler\nBut that the generosity of the ... hour period in Germany reached such a fever pitch that even middle of the road Germans said enough is enough and they started to rethink their moderate positions that couldn't take it anymore\nSo we have no longer any gatekeepers in the media except to block conservatives like me for oil outlets in the media it's still a miracle um on the radio you got to understand something\nThat I'm Still standing here after twenty five years of being as graphically honest as any person in the history this media as open as I Am is almost a miracle it actually is a miracle\nIt is a God pocket God part of the red sea is from Michael me in Nineteen Ninety four and here I Am\nThat doesn't mean January is going to be the same it will not be the same my show is changing dramatically one hour of radio one hour of a podcast but many stations that have been desperate to drop me will be dropping to show some new ones will come along I'll be very clear with you it's all political make no mistake about it\nAnd the radio media landscape is going to move in the same direction as Fox News\nCenter left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center right and they're making a disastrous era a on many many levels [noise]\nSo now we see what happens when you stand up to the establishment and when the establishment becomes degenerate and sick\nAnd you say nothing about it you are allowed to function in the society but if you speak out against that you yourself become the victim the truth dies and along with it the truth teller\n\nLast night Trump gave a speech in front of a crowd\nAnd while he is right about what he said about Dr fraud the optics are awful he went off the rails now mind you I'll repeat what I said he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraud he does everything right from the heart\nAnd since this whole Ford cabin or thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always the front of the cabinet and always giving credence to Dr fraud\nAnd he doesn't even acquiesced to Democrats in waiting another week so the FBI could investigate these claims again I Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just said last night but the optics are awfully went off the rails you see in front of an adoring crowd in Mississippi he mocked Dr frauds testimony\nTo the tremendous applause we heard it\nAnd what happened every news Cast Lead with this all of the western media outlets all the twisted sister's in the news business\nWe're having panel discussions on Trump's horrible treatment of a sexual abuse survivor he gave them the father they were looking for\nNow this doesn't affect solely the media or the Democrats but demon cat voters who are already looking to take out Republicans and the demon cat fringe activists\nWho are loudly confront the Republicans everywhere they can run into them\nAh it also feeds reasons for guys like Jeff Flake stir and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to not support capital in a vote on the floor I think it was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when it gets in front of a crowd\nHe makes you believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on the telephone to a television personality of calls him all the time and I think that's the problem\nI think what happens he goes off the phone from his TV personality goes on stage after getting pumped up I Am I think she's on television when he's not he has to think about the consequences of what he is saying\nAnd so as I say to you this is a very difficult time to be in the media especially when I'm Michael Savage and the Switzerland of talk radio right that one down I declare myself the the Switzerland of talk radio\nWhy do I say on the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been\nIn fact uh I don't go to a Republican events I generally don't like Republicans\nHowever in the times that we are in there is no clear a choice than ever as to the safe for party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats to ... it's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what is it different for them\nUp producing a book that will be out Tuesday called stop mass hysteria what is a difference I mean I Know you're going to go buy it my hard core audience will buy it you'll never see it on on Fox News because they are part of the cartel which is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way is going through a big change now that Lackland Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is going to fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get a phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could\nMSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the strength at a video camera and podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it is to be obscure in America when they had the chance to open themselves up to a man who tells the truth\nThe whole truth and nothing but the troops to help him God and they chose to ignore him while so many people listen to him they'll find out what it is to be on the outside one day and as I said you last week lead guard seed vengeance I don't I never have and I never will be right back\nEnjoying the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight by four Hubbard seven to eight to salvage\nThe Savage Nation
