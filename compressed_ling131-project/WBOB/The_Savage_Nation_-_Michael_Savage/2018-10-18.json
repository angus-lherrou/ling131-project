was just shocking poverty is disclosed for having practice discrimination against Asians and whites and saying that that's not discrimination\nAnd my book bags at the number eleven on the New York times less than I'm moving into a cycle of seven Elevens what does this numerology mean\nAnd we have Gary the numbers go I Hope he's right this time Gary on W. N. T. W. and Virginia Line to what does this mean seven eleven\nAnd you hope I'm right this time last time I was their program I told you Donald Trump your neck for the United states\nSo let's start with that but let's go into your eleventh thing number one there's two ways to look at number eleven number one that we use the number two the way it pops up now let's go to the first nine eleven happened eleven first plane hit the world Trade Center for the Web and nine eleven happened two hundred fifty four to five forty quote the lab and the twin towers looked like an ... number\nTwo hundred fifty fourth day of the year two five four equals eleven the twin towers looked like an ... number eleven ... standing side by side they both have a hundred and ten stories are homeless city happened for Nineteen Nineteen Ninety five\nFor one nine one nine Ninety five after thirty eight three Nate adds up to eleven first bomb went off at nine o to do the math again eleven and then executed Timothy McVeigh for on the eleventh\nSo basically what is going on here because obviously that's not going to be I can understand that number has five racial energy that\nPeople who are in power are very we're very aware of this now if you think on line ask yourself why World War one ended at eleven eleven at exactly eleven o'clock they didn't fire shot that tend to be five they waited till eleven\nOr hold on what to seven cycles of eleven plus two of my last book sitting number Lebanon the New York times list and your mind mean for me\nIs that what it means in my mind is what it is and basically what it is is that you are having an emotional impact on people with a lot\nThat's what it basically breaks down to\nYou have to understand that when average you see the number eleven whether it's the weather Charlottesville when they made sure to have ... or they have to say the figures or it doesn't matter where you go with this\nNumber eleven is going to touch people emotionally I'll give you an example of how this works I'm lying\nLet me interject for a minute my friend Vernon ... who is a promised\nSaid this he said Dr Savage the number eleven is considered a master number is the most powerful neurological vibration\nRemember you send vibration he said simply say to the double one is the number of awakening\nWhen it shows up at the notes that the catalytic the message is being relayed which will serve to inspire eliminate motivate additionally seven as the number of wisdom knowledge and enter reflection therefore seven cycles of eleven only magnifies that concept of awareness which sets in motion a change of or a breakthrough for you my best learning what do you think about that\nI Would agree with the lives that and the way you can show again the way you verify this if you look at the way they do not want average everyday people do what they do they're in a store called seven eleven all around the world is that it's obviously those two numbers go very well together\nThat's generic that's a generic statement what does it mean with regard to my my numbers eleven coming up all the time\nNot generic at all because the only way to verify this stuff actually work it's a look at the people at the top of the game and see how they're actually doing things\nSo yes they're doing things under eleven energy but the what your friend told you was only the positive side there's negative side lumber eleven to that's why al ... was form on August eleventh that's why it hit New York on nine eleven that's why they hit ... pain on three eleven that's why they moved from India after eleven so there's two sides of the coin Savage\nAnd energy so what are you saying\nWhat I'm saying is this you are touching people alive with your words you have a gift for writing and that's exactly why your books are reaching number eleven it's our New York times to manipulate and lift up a number of that's coming out because you're having the most emotional\nBut wait a minute the book before Trump's ... before I got paid the reason was number one on the New York times list that's another one uh one than a Lebanon eleven so white Vernon says Savage first of all I predict stunning results for the podcast venture he says you'll get more or less\nJust from other age groups of demographics it's going to be huge and he goes on from there well scary you don't want to make any predictions though you\nMay I Will make you a prediction that when it comes down to this point won't be proved to be a fraud\nThank you very much for saying something I don't know nothing about

saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid\nNo I'm saying this is\nWhat you are you're saying yes you're saying automatically because if a kid comes from my house so let's say there is no father which by the way it's not even a racial thing anymore let's say there's no father at home with a single parent\nAnd let's say a there he's poor and he lives in a terrible neighborhood how do you explain all of the poor whites who came out of tremendous poverty\nAnd yet excelled in school how do you explain that\nI I Am in favor for profit for its I realize that\nThe you know that there was a time at Harvard that Jews were not permitted into Harvard or you know that\nFor something that\nYou know let let me just explain it I've studied this in great detail that was a time the Jews were prohibited from entering harbor did you know that\nYes I flew into that yet\nAnd yet some kids won't let them because they were so brilliant their scores were so high there was a genius was they finally let 'em in okay\nNow we've turned it around where you're the stupidity or the higher your chances of getting a no he's not my friends stop with the words like homelessness to me to me homelessness has no meaning that's a left wing phrase to make you feel guilty and the other word is disadvantaged what do you think every person in this country was white has an advantage you\nBelieve in white privilege no that's why that's why this would help poor white kids ... and for the you know in other words if\nYou're thinking you're increasing the way that you have for their relative achievement in school with they grow up and you're making\nA good point but how fair is that\n[noise] I think it's fair\nNo that's like saying being a big fish in a little pond as opposed to being a small fish in a big pond\nExactly right so you're saying take the big fish from the small pond and then when that kid who thinks she's great from Appalachia because he got straight days in a high school of a underperforming or poor performing kids winds up an elite college so called there are no such things anymore unless they're in the hard science as the rest is all trash\nUnless you're the hard science has no such thing as an institution that's better than the other all of the others mishmash of direct\nIn plain English but let's say you take the kid who was number one an Appalachian high school and you put them into a so called Ivy League school and then he ... he faces kids who've been studying since they're one year old how is he gonna do\nHell hell hole improvement self at a young age rather than trying to get social justice what his forty years old and ... and he doesn't\nSay well you're assuming you will is you're making an assumption that because you let him into that elite school is going to become a fair minded person\nI've seen the opposite I think the people that were given an unfair advantage to become worse because then they expected their whole life and then it gets out of a Princeton and Harvard or Yale whatever and then when he goes for a job and then he goes into the corporate world and then what is he the man you hire me around what I'll show you\nKnow know what can\nYou ask anybody in the corporate world what they have to put up with with kids would come out of these schools who use the very same tactics they used to get into the schools in the corporation they will sue you with the drop of a hat everybody knows this\nThe thing is people listening doing saying how dare even say it I Know what goes on in this country what should I hide what's real\n\nWell we disagree on this one I say no don't get any won a special advantage either it's equal to every one or it's not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or it isn't racism so if your school Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism\nAnd you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight that so [noise] but no one who's ... listen to the show they're too busy working a four\nAnd five forty seven to eight to now before I take\nA break I Can't wait for the park has come January\nCan I tell you a bit about it we have big podcast meeting this morning I have a team of sixteen people it's so it's going to be amazing here's how it's going to work the show is going to be alive this first hour on the stations that carry me\nNow some stations will not carry me not because the ratings are annoying Norman's ratings but because we are going to be going into the cycle of of the election and liberals are running some of these stations that taking me off the air that's the way it is I don't care what they tell you that's what's happening\nOkay but the rest of your we'll get we'll hear the radio show for an hour and then anybody can hear the podcast for free there's no charge for it anywhere in the world at any time and I suspect that it'll be one of the largest broadcaster in the world and so all predictors indicate that it will become one of the most important part Kass on the planet\nAnd if you don't believe me wait until January you wait and see what's going to happen so one way or the other the gatekeepers are going to go whether it's at Harvard or on the radio business it's that simple they can try all they want to destroy any station in the world and get away with it but you know what if you have the truth the truth is going to set you free\nK B.

and you know that\nI'm so into like when I Want to cook I can taste the difference between the food cooked in one frying pan and another I usually use ... for example nuns get pants I use I the reason the convenience whatever last night I pulled out I'm a little weird with stuff\nI had a frying pan I bought two years ago I never use the none none of non skit I like save things they're gonna find things that I bought that will never used in my life I don't know why buy them if I'm not using them\nI buy like a beautiful frying pan so I don't have the ... so I hooked on that last night the food tasted different tasted better I didn't taste I don't know what I think the kids the nuns skin plastics are breaking off into our food there's no question about it no matter what they tell you it's like bottle of water I got to tell you this I was drinking\nI should mention the brand let's say a plastic bottled water for years because I didn't want the fluoride and I didn't want some of the other stuff in an attack on the right and you know you get used to it but you don't realize you're drinking plastic\nSo my son says no no you can only drink bottled water from bottles she sends me cases of it I Love him he loves me so much I'll tell you the truth I Can't go back to the plastic Warner anymore the\nMinute I put it to our mouth ... plastic and it's not psychological I can taste the plastic and the water doesn't make sense they put the water in a bottle\nSeven thousand miles away it sits in the bottom of a ship\nThe plastic breaks down in the hold of the ship that in the warehouse down in the truck [noise] of course you get a taste plastic if you've got to find so I mean it's a different things like the frying pan so it's out of the frying pan into the fire so to speak\nSo it's not a political statement on making it all like I'm not blaming anyone say the communists did it a Bernie Sanders didn't do it to me the pope did make the frying pan just thought about that are just talking on the level of like a cooking\nI could do a whole park is I'm cooking someday\nYou won't believe what I made last night I Know you don't want to hear something that I see doing this again\nIt was so good I took two portions I intended to eat ... one portion and then I you know what is the weather changes I got out a bottle of red wine that had in the closet for many years a ... eleven to them they'll oh\nI Can't touch that stuff [noise] red wine in the summer I get a smashing migraine the minute it gets cold and against getting cold out here now hot days cold nights every or October the same yeah global warming every October like clockwork\nLike clockwork burning hot days and cold nights nothing changed I live near the water as it got up one millimeter and all the years I've lived next to it but do asked some schmuck at Harvard and global warming the sea levels are rising they never been down to the see\nThe former mayor of San Francisco never rode on the

[noise]\nTroops the border communists focus communist documentary making in the Vatican was just shocking and\nMy book makes it to number elaborate on the New York times less poverty is disclosed for having practice discrimination against Asians and whites and saying that that's not discrimination\nSo you think that you want to send your kid to Harvard I Want you to think again about forty thousand applications arrive every year and the racist to run a Harvard with all these forty thousand down to two thousand acceptance letters unfortunately\nThose accepted and not being accepted based upon their qualifications they're being accepted based upon race straight out race discrimination that is what's coming out in the trial right now or that as a result of Asian Americans saying enough is enough\nBecause they're sending SAT scores higher for Asian Americans at higher for whites\nAnd this is absolutely violating the civil rights of everyone as a matter of fact because affirmative action is racist in one way or the other\n[noise] an attorney representing the students for fair admissions accused Harvard of giving Asian Americans significantly lower ratings for certain personal qualities listen to that that's how they used to get around it let's say you were a kid I got a six hundred SAT instead of sixteen hundred and they wanted to assure you when\nThey said you had great leadership qualities website and you add compassion now how can you judge compassionate leadership\nA great leadership qualities let's say and you had compassion now how can you judge compassionate leadership that's made of the two made up things right so they give Asian Americans lower ratings for certain personal qualities such as leadership and compassion than any other race can you believe this\nBut the liars at Cambridge, Massachusetts Harvard said oh no we don't engage in discriminatory practices our doors are open to the students of all backgrounds and means yeah but it's open more for some students and others\nThe door is only cracked open for Asians and whites while it's not taken off its hinges for others if you get the picture\nNow you know this is an interesting turnabout because no matter how this case turns out\nIt will go to the U.S Supreme Court well which is really good news for all those unfair to us in admissions and hiring is in the biggest you see as a comedian said when I think it was when Clinton took the a presidency\nThere was a comedian who looked up at the sky is the air force that in a fly over and the comedians said at the White House that's our air force now remember that famous line\nWell guess what that's our Supreme Court now [laughter]\nAh\nOh yeah that's our Supreme Court now and so we'll go to the Supreme Court and finally the

you don't want to your living room you want to take them in and then of course the liberal argument as well with all that money spent on the military we can be spending the money on the immigrants and on the poor and other homeless I've heard of before I heard it for Thirty years\n[noise] and so this is a big story there's a question about it for sending the military to close the southern border long overdue as I said yesterday the solution is simple there in Mexico\nThey're they're moving through Guatemala into Mexico we have a new deal with the Mexican people based on that though\nThere are

for being too smart correct\nA social service or it's a riverside you in other words ... using the riverside to admit people dumber you are the better off you are\nYeah well you have to understand is that true purpose of affirmative action and these quotas the the true purpose is to make sure that a white liberals maintain that at least the plurality but ideally a majority on campus because if they don't have to have the numbers\nThen we will reached a tipping point for white people no longer want to go to schools like Harvard and they'll end up like Cal Tech and Berkeley were basically they're dominated by Asians and not because Asians um\nHave necessarily the best of everything but white liberals no longer want to go there because they don't feel like they're in the majority anymore [noise]\nSo what are you actually saying there is there are there isn't discrimination against Asians\nSerious discrimination against their agents for what I'm trying to say that Asians actually have the highest benchmark the highest standard of all the races followed\nBy white there the standard basically the benchmark and blacks Hispanics Native Americans actually at points added during the process of admissions to their formula\nRight well that's what came out during the ... the trial now in in Cambridge the Asian American suit Harvard and found out that they are being top loaded ... against them their scores have to be higher to even be considered\nA higher and higher than any of the race that's a that's the main point and the purpose behind that again is not for diversity but to make sure that white liberal\nDo not fall into the minority because then they would reached that tipping point right just like we have white flight in the cities and yes white flight here in northern California white people no long no longer want to live in neighborhoods that are ... predominantly Asian\nSame with the colleges so Harvard and Yale\nDamage your white people don't want to live in Asia neighborhoods does that affect\nEver have you ever seen neighborhoods in Fremont Cupertino San Francisco where all the white people go where the public school\nHow wait wait a minute how come Nancy Pelosi has and fled yet\nBecause first of all she's a grandmother and second of all her kids if they go to school for grandkids I should say we'll go to private ... high schools\nIn other words it doesn't apply to her\nFor Iraq\nSo what what do you think needs to be done to make things fair for everyone\nWill obviously the missions formula has to be done applies equally fall races you can't have a penalty for being Asian and a lot of points just for being black or Hispanic Native American the way it is today and we have to let\nThe urine admissions consulting so let's look at Harvard for example or yellow prince and the same thing applies to all of these schools have subjects that are extremely difficult but you can't fake whether it be astrophysics for organic chemistry or things like that are you telling me that the kids who admitted\nWith these rigs scores are able to compete in those classes\nHit the nail on the head they don't major in physics for electrical engineering\nSo what do the kids who are admitted under these weeks than is what are they major in\nTheir major in anything with the words studies after it was her\nCommend [laughter] that's funny you let me of the studies the examples of what they major in\n... even environmental science which is a bogus science\nYes of course that's environmental studies which means whatever you want to make it into this not a science social studies going through a metal is if you want to if you want to go look at bums in the street that social studies\nDon't go into a math department at Harvard for the electrons entering parliament at MIT and what do you see it's all Asia the white people don't want to go there anymore\n... wait a minute this all Asians biggest whites can't get in because they're not smart enough or they don't even apply\nApply their intimidates they get what are they in what what are they intimidated by\nYou know exactly what I'm Talking about their intimidated by seeing so many hardworking Asians and they sit there and they think oh my God I'm not going to be able to fly through college I'm going to go and major in something easier and usually the cop\nOut you're actually saying the white kids are afraid to go to Harvard now\nOr the yes they are for certain majors I of course they're never going to have any trouble majoring in history right as long as they follow the party line\nWhat I don't know where you're coming from actually you're starting to be will demean now I don't quite know what you're saying on one hand you're saying that the admissions are rigged against whites and Asians and then you're saying that whites are cowardly and don't even want to apply\nWhat I'm saying like oh is that there are academic get ... academic ghettos for Asians or guess what the stem feels feels where they dominated by the the lesser students go away towards away from them because\nThose are you you're not in ... you're not implying that they are white students can't make it an electrical engineering or are you\nNot at all not at all I'm I'm implying that there are many fewer or because they are as many of them are intimidated by\nThe show where where there's a white kid will stray apply if he wants to go into electrical electrical engineering where we apply\nApply to MIT they can apply to Cal Tech or even Berkeley right foot\nAnd they and they don't have the same skewed admissions policies\nWell they can get in based on a formula but they're not to ... ... ...\nOh you mean ... actually the one of the worst examples\nOf course they are they they ... the standard for everyone right they they\nPlan to say they set the standard for racism now Harvard that's they knew that the new distinction\nCorrect they they uh they penalize Asians and everyone else followed them because again they didn't want to reach the tipping point for the student body because majority Asian when that happens that all the white liberals are going to leave and where do they go from there\nI I have a PHD from UC Berkeley and I remember what was going on there was so many Asians because they're good students they study are they come from families that pushed them very hard for the whole tiger mother thing their background is won a scholarship and learning or else you're a loser it's that simple so I admire them and I would see the number of agents growing growing growing you know what I say that people\nI don't care if it's a hundred percent Asian it wouldn't matter to me if they all got an based on brains it wouldn't matter to me at all\nAnd so said Reagan back when he was governor of California for basically go to Berkeley saying what do you see you see hardly any white students correct\nI haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay\nThat's correct I haven't been there and twenty I won't even go over the bridge okay\nYeah I Know I ... I basically never go to the East Bay I have nothing jarring me that's kind of sad I used to love Berkley I won't go there it's heartbreaking to go there the last I went there and looked like a male stream of insanity of all they do is ride on the campus I mean there was no reason for me to go there\nSo you're saying that the world has shifted so dramatically but isn't this um lawsuit going to straighten things out a little bit\nWell it depends you and I both know that it's probably got a wife or the court system\nFor many years and of course Harvard and all the uh didn't leave a paper trail and they were they were given carte blanche to do this by the hockey decision back in Nineteen Seventy eight where you could use race as a factor law have explicit quota\nBut didn't they didn't write the quotas down they just put it in their heads and say okay every time we get an age students subtract points\nEvery time we have a black Hispanic Native American\nIn your opinion that has a society benefit benefited from affirmative action\nNot at all because when you look at for example at the top two universities see the under represented minorities have a much lower graduation rates and the wife on the Asia and they don't tend\nTo what about the lawsuits against the university I as anyone calculated what percentage come from which race\n[noise] yes of course it's been calculated for example the acceptance race by race so the acceptance race race race by race a white people with the exact same standard as an Asian have tripled acceptance rate of an an Asian students for\nExample and a Spanish student conversely has tripled acceptance rate of all white students with the exact same statistics [noise]\nIt's a terrible situation when you're a young person who's working hard to be knocked out because of the way you you look in your race it's horrible and I and it's the opposite of what our U.S Constitution and bill of rights permits more specifically and violates proposition two oh nine\nWhich is a state law but of course in a lawless state propositions don't mean anything unless they advanced the Marxist agenda\nUniversity of California did to the to get around it when they did is they hired more black Hispanic initials officers and readers for throwing admissions process\nThose admissions officers were obviously more sympathetic towards black Hispanic students\nAre you yourself Asian or Caucasian or what\nI Am an agent who attended uh Berkeley and five schools as well wow so\nYou know what hard workers weren't you driven by your parents to succeed\n[noise] yes I was and so we're all of my family and\nI was I I mean ... either we made it all you can sue outcasts and in my world honest to God we were pushed\nThat's how that's how a kid makes you can't tell them that if he can't study as alert and what is it called now learning anxiety that's now a disorder can you believe this test test anxiety is a new disorder\nCrazy well thank you for doing this work it's amazing it's a it's astounding to me what kind of people we get calling the show from across this country\nSuffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret put that over your gym mushy exercise machines just hand write it on a boat on a piece of cardboard suffer the pain of discipline to suffer the pain of regret and it goes to everything you're doing in your life I'll be right back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "18"}
