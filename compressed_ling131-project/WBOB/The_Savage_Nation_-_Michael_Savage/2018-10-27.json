B. O. B. O. R. G.\n[noise]\nWelcome back financial issues um they're furious rate to veer off and all the join us for the third our we sure do appreciate it we're coming to\nYou live from Mobile Alabama where we are doing a town hall meeting tonight we have a great time\nI'm sure we're going to have a great crowd we always do and I'm looking forward to it [noise] um we we love being here we love the seafood and more than anything but we do love being here and um\nI went to one of our favorite place this year when we come to mobile and we're going to our favorite place\nToday\nSome time before the town hall meetings so [noise]\nUm anyway good food man good food good people little hot but aside from that it doesn't get any better so we we uh love mobile or glad or a year and we hope you'll come out to see us tonight we're going to be at the Mariette on airport boulevard\nA tonight at six thirty come out early like the meat as many of you as I possibly can to try to do that we'll get started I Want to hear from you and I think a lot of questions I Want to hear about what you're thinking about the economy or you're thinking about the elections how that's going to impact your ability to be a good steward or not we want to hear about those things\nUm will give you a little bit of a recap of ah where where we think things are headed and we'll we'll go from there right now all the industry still are you know they really haven't I Wonder what the volume is I have not checked and I should check it at the last week [noise]\nBut I Wonder where the volume is right now I'm because\nThis is this is what we like to see you know if you start to feel good when you get you we've got some great economic numbers we got a pending home sales are going up I'm almost every one percent uh that's pretty good because it's been four straight months of losing streaks\nOn pending sales a very good number so we're really excited about that we got a very good ... good numbers durable goods very important number ... and I'm I'm kinda surprised because new home sales were down some kind of surprised by this number\n... it was what I was hoping for but I'm surprised so we got a better half of one percent increase in durable goods\nDurable goods or were expected to be a negative a number of one point five percent\nSo that was a mess in the right direction\nAnd that's very good to hear so consumer still extremely confident uh and durable goods one of the things that I'm concerned about that could put a stop to all of this confidence is if a gasoline prices continue to rise and and you know that's something that we have\nTo be a can concern about\nA particularly as we look at what what's happening to oil prices but they have been coming\nDown oil prices have been coming down\nAnd continue to come down and uh hopefully a gasoline prices are coming down so we're at a two eighty where at two dollars and eighty four cents nationally it was to two dollars in eighty seven cents on Monday last week\nIt was two dollars in eighty seven cents\nWeek so we're about uh where we were were lower than we were last week's slightly show\n'em good news or we go back a month or two eighty five would go back a year ago we are to forty five so when you love to see two dollars or forty five cents\nFor gasoline again that would be wonderful I Love to get back to a year ago because a year ago diesel fuel was two dollars and Seventy three cents and right now ... three dollars and twenty nine cents\nSo uh this is going to be great gasoline prices moving in the right direction along with a crude oil crude oil is saying\nYou know up where it needs to be for stock prices it's holding this Seventy six I'm Sorry sixty seven a dollar a barrel\nSo that's that's good I I you know if we continue on this trajectory we're going to be by the middle of next month a Thanksgiving\nAnd you're going to roll those over to gather all in one place in your new i._r._a. account that's where it's all going to go\nThey say fit\nAnd because I had to send it his death it get in get out and make out\nOkay now is are all the accounts in one place\nYou know that they're they're not want to like [noise]\nOkay [noise] so at some point in time there is no hurry there's no sense of urgency\nBut I but put them all in one just so you know where everything is and you're only getting one statement every month they don't make it easier for you so if you if they move I think you said they moved to fidelity maybe\nYeah or something where [noise] okay\nSo that would be a great one to just put it all into that\nBut here's the thing and after you do that it's going to be easy because they're already in your name so it's going to be real easy to do\nThe fidelity people without account ... people will will give you a transfer for them to sign it's not hard to do do take care of it you won't have to do anything just have to sign the transfer for on those other camps that aren't in there and just let it all go in there\nIt's when it comes in it goes into just a money market account just earning a little bit of interest don't turn anything for a year\nFor I don't want you to invest it I don't want you to think about it you're going to have people that are going to call you\nOwe the animal in Congress say\nOh I Know they have and they're going to keep going you you're not don't do anything don't do anything just get the accounts during your name [noise] even if you don't move 'em that's okay but don't do any investing just leave everything alone\nAnd then a year from now or so\nUh when when things settled down you've got so many changes to go through I'm so sorry to hear about your loss\nAnd there's so many there's so much emotion that we you know that we all have one we have\nA loss like that and I you you're not in a place not you but nobody is in a place to make any decisions or to talk to anybody as far as I'm concerned about anything for the next year\nSo I Want you to relax [noise] nothing can go wrong or happen with that money nothing just let it sit it transferred and sit and probably in a money market account most of it [noise]\nJust let it sit there don't worry about it when the statements come you don't even have to open them throw him in a file don't even don't even open it doesn't matter it's all irrelevant it doesn't matter what happens ah just forget about it for twelve months and then\nA year from now call me back\nAnd ... we'll talk through some options and some things you might want to think about it [noise]\nBut don't don't talk to anybody a at all or do you do you get a cold well it's really important to you do it now because the markets don't know nothing's nothing's important they have to do anything now so don't even worry about it just relax\nAnd a move on there so many other things far more important that you can be praying through in working out\nIn the next twelve months and this is in one of them so don't even worry about it so that's what I Want you to do and I think that all serve you really well later on\nOkay I'm Out that one more question Bob Hope and believe that\nAnything that has a\nLot of cat and then he said recently started working with me with a team and they are getting paid ... what do I what I mean I Can't the positive at all or\nNothing or or do I do know don't don't do anything with it\nEven worry about it and I'm going to throw it in the same category don't even worry about it don't do anything don't don't take a look at it won't do anything I mean that it doesn't matter I I just\nI don't want to get even give you any ideas because I don't want you to be I I just you don't need to even be thinking about it so it's not nothing's happening yeah I I'm going to I'm going to have some things that I'm going to want you to do a year from now or so but it's okay don't worry about it\nUm you know in another year we ... we got to look at everything that you have it\nUm you know in another year we get we get a look at everything that you have\nAnd see if it works obviously if you need some of that to fix something or by some huge you know use it for that but uh don't don't worry about where it is or what it's not doing or what it is doing just just leave that alone is well\nOkay um [noise] we were\nWere too young to I mean we were were ... we were both fifty three do it you know and I I don't mean anything because he was the kind of person that if you wanted something we have bought and bought it All right so there's no credit card debt before that I just ah\n[noise] I I'm Sorry I didn't feel but well I'm just you know a part of the earth but well\nYeah well you never have to be sorry for that and you certainly don't have to be ... sorry for being overwhelm you should be overwhelmed it's just a natural thing and you you would be I'm just trying to take one little element away it's not going to keep you from being totally\nA overwhelmed by so many other things but right now it's not something that should even be in your on your list of things to be thinking about\n... I definitely appreciate I listen to you every morning and I definitely appreciate all that you may\nEnd up they don't know if the if I keep a cop out the work but I mean but he never even heard of you know I Know yeah well even my number because\nThat unless it in it but yeah so many uh and that their company called ... and ... and you're right you're definitely right they call I mean all out of it\nUp so much they have any questions tell them to call me and my phone number here the car to the show say you know I I I'd love to talk to just to get them just to get them off your back say call this guy here's a phone number I mean they're not going to call but um and yeah don't don't even worry about it you're you're in great shape\nOr your husband or was was very wise in very prudent and the way he did things I Wish more people\nAre operated like like key uh obviously did and a what a blessing that's going to be to you later later in in life but um [noise] just just ah don't worry about anything and just forget about it and we'll talk again a year from now you keep listening\nOkay All right well thank you and keep keep me go ahead\nOh I Will I Will okay I promise I Will okay all righty and God Bless you You're welcome\nAnd folks we all need to be praying for and you ... you know and I hope that you will I Hope that that all the listeners will think about ants un I lift a two or tomorrow morning this morning when you and your prayer time lifting enough to you that that God would hold her firmly in it in his grip\nAnd that um she would she would find that to strengthen the courage or in the peace of mind to not be overwhelmed and it's such a difficult thing let me go to Roy Roy calling us from Texas hey Roy\nAnd then I have two questions\nRegarding Roth our age and I'll be as brief as possible by a okay automated farmer's son and Arkansas that a little farm worked on jobs for eight years it didn't work out to be that banks profitable for him now his wall\nAnd I'd like to take the proceeds from the sale of that farm and try to get her off our our array for him but he's got no income\nUh other than our show and I don't know what the eligibility standard is a new not know the amount of money that I can contribute towards them\nOr to or Jews or off for a year to if you can help me with those questions appreciated\nSure so here's the thing Roy he can't put more if he's under fifty I assume he is he's under fifty he can't put more than five thousand five hundred dollars fifty five hundred dollars in a Roth by\nIn order to open a Roth and contribute to her off you have to have earned income\nSo I'm his odd jobs and those kinds of things qualify for some earned income\nSo they would be okay on the ... list um you know by um don't buy anything off abroad less despite I'm also buy less [noise]\nAnd then they blew highlighted ones on the by list as well in you know there's some in energy they prefer utility companies\nUm utilities is a one sector right now that's held up really well through all this [noise] um so uh yeah I mean I Would I Would try to focus more on the blue highlighted ones and I just say to you there are so\nMore on the blue highlighted ones and I just say to you there are some that are paying six percent income\nYou'll you'll see and I might only have um listed as growth in income there's a couple that I only have listed as grows because I don't feel confident enough\nThat the income is going to be sustainable not not because the stocks bad but sustainable because of the company doesn't have a long track record of pain pain that kind of did a day and and I and I don't feel confident enough\nTo make it up purely an income stock or because I think you could start to see the income diminish\nAh as they constantly are lower or that the dividend so that's why some of those aren't highlight it but it for the short term they're fine but I Would try to stick to ah the the ... and the utilities I have a couple reached real estate investment trust\nAre that are on a by less right now that are that are good income stocks and they're the ones that I'd be focusing to wean and all but if you want to you as you get into consumer staples\nAnd the industrial ... you know look for I think that that you you said look for you know the growth in income so that you're always getting some income and sometimes those grows an income the incomes you know two and a half three percent I mean it's still decent\nUh but I'm just just not as a and they are consistent they're just not as high as some of the purely income stocks\nOkay so look for growth in income or that explains it and again God Bless you up really appreciate what you do\nThank you John appreciate your saying that senators rent or aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three aid for for seven o seven fifty five thirty three if you want it to your car oh You're welcome to do it let me go to John John's calling us from Texas said John\nGood

your list and um they're eight seed twenty four nights she twenty nine\nAnd I was wondering if I should just split between the two and make a two purchases I had been tracking with one you used to have on your list recently agency forty one and I know the rule is if it's not on the ballot stumped by\nBut a ...\nUm no I wouldn't I wouldn't split the whole sector\nBetween those two stocks\nRather see you let I how much what the percentage the you're the you're trying to get what do you should have in that sector ... percent [noise] okay so I Would look at may be\nPutting three percent in that in those two stocks okay\nAnd and then just wait you know something will come along here ah and then you know try to add maybe two more um with that other two percent so I I'd rather you not put it just the whole five percent with those two\nOkay All right but definitely but definitely take a position you know and healthcare why why you can yeah\nWhat a what a good restaurant you're going to eat

one K. you got Social Security or whatever you have there you know what that is and so it all it all comes to\nUh you don't want to use some of that income to put aside in in\nEmergency savings you weren't already have that\nSo uh I Would say if you have been relatively new home you don't feel like you feel like most of the maintenance or things that can happen you're going to do out of your regular\nYou know just your normal income stream\nFrom on a regular basis you don't have any debt you know certainly you want to have a ten thousand dollar you know emergency savings account eight to ten thousand dollars but I Would say as you get closer to that retirement and you're now you're you know two years away from retirement you want to have that build up a little bit more\n[noise] um\nYeah no I agree [laughter] that that not because I got it from like a working for a long time ago like okay I'm On the market in the ... the six month expenses what every year and I just didn't know if\nI guess I heard your last Frank I'm somebody asked about how much money do you eat you know have it or you can retire at you had let them know that you should be able to plan on a five or six percent\nReturn so I get as far as like OK shooting or an income stream to be able to let on right but then I was just wondering okay like in addition to that you you know how\nHow much maybe as a percentage or I guess there's not that doesn't really work but\nWell I I mean remember ten years ago Fifteen Years ago\nI Would have been worried not not I mean if you were Fifteen Years younger I'd be worried about I'd ask you things like what kinds of jobs do you do you feel secure in their jobs have seniority\nIf the downturn in the economy would you likely get laid off because you're in the construction industry or would you be fine because you work for the local government or you're a teacher you know cry so I Would look at those things are critically important when you think because if I lose my job do I have enough income to carry me Carrie\nI lose my job do I have enough income to carry me carrying my expenses\nFor six months so very different situation I'm not as concerned about that for two reasons one is your little closer to retirement a you're a little bit older I Hope you have some you know real sense of the security on your job and the other thing is we live in an environment right now\nWhere are the threat of you know lay offs and losing a job um aren't as\nBig a deal say they would have been seven or eight years ago so I think I think the important issue is to take care of those emergency expenses that you don't want to get in debt to fix so\nWell I have a credit card if my furnace blows up I use credit card well yeah but now you got the debt and you've got to ... dead for ... years\nSo that's not a good strategy a better strategy is my furnace blows up I've got savings that I can replace it with so or ... or maybe you have income that you can use you know but so I Would just keep it isolated to those things and everybody is it a little bit of a different situation and that\nThat ... area that's why I hate to say you ought to have five percent of your income or ten percent of your income or you know one third of your annual gross salary you know committed to a um urgency savings because it may not\nIt may not be the case said it all you know I had so\nI Would just try to work backwards towards some worst case scenarios of what would happen right now and do I have emergency savings to take care of that so I don't have to get that\nOkay [noise] okay thank you very much\nAll right Bonnie I'm Glad you called I sure do appreciate thank you for your partnership\nThat's great I sure appreciate it\nLet me go to Stan Stan also calling it a ... state also calling us from Ohio a stand\nAlone to an ... good morning here last year saying by speaking the gospel trained for financial aid industry\nHad a question about [noise]\nSpecific stock in reference or not a teacher and coach and their finances stabbed rushing retirement age and leaving it legacy\nOr the next generation licensed broker\nA stir right right\nI was wondering what the [noise] someone saying lost money because they're not a a light switch stock sales personally yes why handle that\nFinancial liability in my scenario minister\n[noise] well I don't think you really have a liability their um the liability comes when you're charge enough see\nThat's when you have a liability so if you charge somebody if somebody says you know a pastor I was thinking about investing money can you help me\nAnd you said you know what for you know I for sixty five dollars an hour you know I'm I'm you know I'd be happy to help you then you got a liability um [noise] so I wouldn't be too concerned about liability\nBut even me one of the things that I Want to do more than anything else and it may be easier in the environment in which you're working for you to do this\nBut my our goal should be you and I stand our goal should be that the people that are in front of us that we want to convict them\nTo bring Jesus into their money\nWe want to convict them that as they would try to walk closer in their day to day world activities with Jesus that they would not separate\nAnd compartmentalize their finances\nThat that that too would be a part of their walk and face\nAnd we want to convince them of that we want to share the versus you know you hear me say that God says\nAh for those who honor me so I see on or not he says that in in first Samuel chapter two at the end of chapter two in you and and then you kinda have to read that whole chapter to to get a feel for that promise\nNow I don't know I thought what an honor looks like and I don't think we should be promising prosperity but I Do believe we can say you get a sense of peace\nUm uh by knowing that you're not grieving the heart of God with\nHow you're investing your money and it's important that we pray about how we should do that where we should go and some ideas this is you speaking out some ideas would be look from what I understand there are\nThere's really only one mutual fund company that you can diversify your portfolio\nAnd diversification is important so you're on a call this Timothy planned group and talk to them where you can fully diversify your portfolio there are a couple other bid look me responsible funds you heard me maybe yesterday recommend a a um\nInflation protected bond fund for somebody that was a specifically responsible to vanguard fund typically responsible most\nGovernment bond funds are typically responsible so there are some other alternatives but you know or use some of the ... you know I I Believe in things if you want to want to do that but you know the ... of the key is your job is to convict them do want to do that\nTo to want to make sure\nThat they're not investing in a company that are supporting abortion and pornography gambling and the redefinition it was funny I I Know in his shoe I'm I'm a mutual fund company that holds themselves out as being biblical responsible\nSomebody this morning a friend of mine sent me an article with a picture of this company set up at the uh L. T. G. beach convention\nUm you know I'm a ... with a booze trying to you know bring 'em the their their marriage uh\nReally important um looked\nAt the the other thing is a ... you mentioned about rationing\nAlready going on 'em and\nMedicare Advantage is taking advantage of rationing to the to to our seniors tell us about that\n[noise] yeah so just to be clear there is something that that government calls original Medicare and and there is Medicare Advantage the original Medicare is what happened in Nineteen sixty five [noise] and it means that you can go anywhere in the hospital any doctor um it it doesn't matter you can be seen anywhere and Medicare takes a ...\nIs as part of that and you you just you know\nA summit the bills to Medicare or the your doctor that through your hospital that but then there's Medicare Advantage which is part of which came up and a two thousand three and this is the HMO or the health plan version of Medicare and what this means is that the health plans to help lead by law are\nAllowed to say to deny you access to care now book Medicare's do deny access to care but the health plans to do it sort of at an arm's length\nDistance from Congress and this is Congress has clan that\nThey would be able to blame the health plans for asking your care once once you got into them so about thirty percent of the Medicare population is in the health plan it limits their access to care by limiting it to a network\nBy limit it to a medically necessary procedures as determined by the health plan um\nBy reducing what they pay to doctors and and the interesting thing is that the U.S department of health and Human Services the office of inspector general came out with a report that said this is so interesting\nThat said that of all the people who shoot and it's both people and practitioners who choose to appeal that denial decisions of health plan Seventy five percent of the time the health plans were versus their decision and move forward to pay for or authorize the care\nBut nobody appeals but only one percent from ... you know probably a vested died appeals and and why is that because\nIt is so difficult to do it because you know their ration health care can happen in many ways including putting bureaucratic\nI'm I'm barriers between the patient and the and the care or between the doctor and payment for their care and so and so you know this is all medically necessary care and the federal government is saying there's probably a lot\nMedically necessary care that's being denied by virtue of the fact that most people aren't appealing but when they appeal most people actually get the care so this is Jeff and that can hit them for asking Ken this is why\nWe tell people to go into original Medicare which which can also ration care is true but at least it's being done in a more accountable manner I connected to\nA Congress and um and it's not the health plan making little ... of money off of you and the taxpayer and I think this is one thing I should add as well so people understand these health plan\nThese plants are not insurance and they're not private market is this public private partnership between the government and these um plans which are really centralized corporate entities that are acting like socialized medicine but in a corporate fashion and I'm here's here's what's so interesting about the money that they're making\nSo somebody you probably have money in and and um you know what in plans in stocks right but but look at this um they are planning for there to be\nNot just Medicare for all the investors in this world think it won't be just a single payer system they're not worried because they're thinking that won't be Medicare for all it will be Medicare Advantage for all in other words it will be HMO run in this country single parent will be HMO health plan\nRun in this country and right now the health plans are making you know like bandits I'm One that does Medicaid only has had a rise in stock prices by four\nThousand percent since two thousand nine United Health group has gone up fourteen hundred percent\nAnd so they're just refinance money hand over fist all because of the Affordable CARE Act and because of Medicare Advantage\nNot ventured they're getting subsidized from ... to be in the Affordable CARE Act which as ludicrous\nIn many ways it's different ways of subsidizing them\n... you know it's just amazing and so if you were in this open enrollment period now folks for for Medicare\nYou really need to examine all of a but stick to the original medical Medicare if you can do that and um maybe you use some air to ministries or\nAs a as a supplement\nI'd also just like a safe for those who have bought the book there is a separate chapter in there about a Medicare Advantage and the accountable care organizations that people in the original Medicare are being forced into in secret\n... if you if you look at those scales section and see what Medicare is doing\nGreat [noise]\nTaught about as great a great stuff we sure appreciated as always [noise] why was the best [noise] nobody knows more about this is why\nI Choose your every month she

Obama criticized President Trump's tenure during a fiery speech and Milwaukee that took aim at him and other Republicans quote this is terrible unquote\nHere's a nother story now the ... the actress who played Megan Kelly\nI'm more of a ... girl so ... this lady played Megan Kelly in a video on a Brittany spears video from ten years ago\nAnd it's a headline that\nShe likes Rachel Maddow MSNBC host may Rachel Maddow better what I mean\nSo she played a conservative or a at a at a music video from a long time ago and it's a headline that she likes a liberal better even though she was like making fun of the conservative in the video anyway okay\nI mean you know I Will just waste everyone's time I guess I mean is that they weren't going to look at this and go oh my God it's that lady I don't know from that video I barely remember um I I guess I should vote for the Democrats\nTo maybe this is making headlines because the the lady played Megan Kelly like ten years ago and\nBecause of Megan Kelly getting fired recently maybe that's the reason why it's a it's a big deal may they went to that lady and um\nAnd by the way she was in that video so I watched the ... it's using them for like a second it's [laughter] it wasn't even worth looking at the video so she\nUm so Megan Kelly is out okay so NBC got rid of vegan Kelly [noise] because Megan Kelly said that on Halloween\nWhat she was a kid that you were allowed to dress up as as who you want so like if there was a black character it was okay for you to paint your face black and pretend that you were that black character for Halloween\nIt's black and pretend that you were that black character for Halloween\nI'm well apparently this is a very controversial because I Know that blackface is not\nAllowed I mean socially because you're making fun of of blacks and you shouldn't do that\nBut I feel like Megan Kelly was saying that it was okay to dress up as a black character I don't think Megan Kelly I mean I listen to the comments\nI don't I don't think although they're really hard to find right now I mean if you go onto um any kind of social media it's hard to find the original comments that got made so everyone's making it sound like Megan Kelly said that black faces okay which she explicitly said it wasn't [laughter]\nBut it doesn't matter you know I mean it just you conflate any ideas together um you know as Jon Stewart ah stated a long time ago nuances not important although he said nuances and important to the right\nOr really just new wants is an important to anybody and uh who cares what she actually said who cares what she meant\nUm ... she gets on TV and she apologizes\nAnd so and then and now she's done so they kicked her out anyway right\nUm I don't know\nI mean the midterms if if you're ever going to not do anything controversial it's going to be around midterms right so why would why would million tell even make a statement like that I don't know\nHead of the ... the heads of the news organizations now certain you know editors and people will still run their own stories\nSo I'm not saying it's not going to make any air time at all here is a politics editor Jason Johnson he's on MSNBC and this is his take on it I'm ... and apparently he's maybe shifting the blame a bit\nTo Donald Trump\nOur lives as much as I may have criticisms of how law enforcement operation of the country they are still our line of defense against maniac them terrorists out there but I I have to say nickel and this has always been a problem with the president has always shown a sympathy or a dismissive towards terrorism or he is a ... a terrorist sympathizers\nRight because if there's anyone known for probably around with terrorists as Donald Trump okay you know these guys are just grasping at straws so I mean I think that's why this may not make that much of an impact\nOn them in terms of man I'm so excited and what's going to have better and who's going to run in twenty twenty [laughter] Elizabeth Warren it's\nHillary Clinton going to run again could you imagine if the two of them were competing against each other although a combination of Hillary Clinton as president and Elizabeth Warren is vice president wouldn't get the lives out\nIn full force so we'll see what happens I Hope that doesn't um by\nHaving Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren fight against each other that would be fan ...\nEspecially in today's political climate where it's like no holds barred because if you look at Obama and Hillary Clinton how they sparred with each other back in two thousand and they they were pretty rough\nI mean considering that was pre Trump era those guys were where I'm a mean each other so you know I'd love to see these two Harvey is go at it\nLet's see what else here we've got a cute story about Trump not\nControlling the news cycle a [laughter] [laughter] I think we all know Trump's always going to control the news cycle it says ah Trump's worst nightmare the news cycle that he can't control um\nWho is this by the Daily Beast\nOr yeah I mean that's just silly here Trump comes face to face with the nightmare news cycle he can't control he's been spending the last week trying to gin up media coverage of a caravan of migrants making their way from Honduras to Mexico us border\nYeah I mean you've heard about that caravan right I mean there's like a whole [laughter] it's like just a flood of immigrants who are apparently held that are coming to the United states Mexico has offered them\n[noise] um oh what did they promised that they basically said you know we'll take care of you and they're like no we want to go to the U.S so I I don't know what's going on with this be asked but um\n[noise] the the right as blaming the left saying that it's a conspiracy theory of left is trying to get them across the border to get sympathy for them [noise]\nBut it's backfired and and people are with Trump they don't want these people crossing the border and so now people on the left her thing it's conspiracy theory by people on the rights trying to get them to cross the border so I mean who knows are we just being inundated with October ...\nAcross the border so I mean who knows are we just being inundated with October surprises did did the left go man we need not just one October surprise we need like twelve October surprises\n[noise] okay so I mean I don't know maybe maybe the left or the writer tried to October surprise each other who does but um now we got this shooting what is this all about\nSuspect identified and deadly Pennsylvania synagogue attack police said the suspected gunman forty six they got his name you know I don't like to publicize the name of these more on he's in custody after multiple people were killed and four officers were injured\nIn a Pittsburgh synagogue Trump it's a terrible terrible thing of course it is here great so now we're going to get derailed again with another battle about gun control well I mean you saw they had to get Trump's comment on it I mean he he is he's the president he's going to control the news cycle\nNo matter what that dumb article says [noise] um let's see more evidence of the midterms coming up yeah Facebook is still leaning and other social media is just deleting\n'em right wing accounts\nLiberty means which for years was up\nOn Facebook so libertarian website that has the it's awesome really funny great means on it they're always good for a laugh every time I look at uh [noise] I don't even think a part of the uh yeah I'm not even part of the group\nBut I'll look at 'em sometimes but they're just they've got these hilarious means all rational people would\nThink that they're hilarious I could see a you know other people getting offended by it but uh they're very very funny\nAnd they were kicked off then they came back as liberty means to point out kicked off again with no explanation their baggage liberty and it means three point out we'll see how long that lasts for but you know this just happened in the last week\nSo it is the purge to point out so they're they're purging um people again\nAnd uh I Know that this is a ... who are they purging their purging conservative or not I shouldn't say conservatives because meal kinds aren't getting purge their purging libertarians\nAnd they are purging of far right activists and their purging far\nLeft activists progressive so they're basically purging any anti establishment voices that you might get with a little extra helping of conservatives\nAnd uh this whole uh keep going I don't know if they're going to\nKeep at it after the midterms happen but they are saying that they're getting away with it I don't think they will for a long though I Do believe in the free market I think somebody else is going to step in and and take over you know it might be in five years time maybe seven years but it it'll happen maybe even a lot\nSooner than that I Know this kind of going rapid fire here's an update on the synagogue a shooting there is\nNow ten people dead I mean people were packed in ... I'm surprised that more than that just horrible man just terrible terrible\nOh you gotta be kidding me okay so now they have a little bit about this guy\nHe's a Trump supporter died in the wall Trump supporter according to the story\nAnd he was on a social media platform called gab I talked about gab last week this is so funny as a competitor [laughter] to Twitter\nSo Twitter has been kicking people off right so now they are they're they're now they're going to go after gab you you watch the I mean come on man this is just all\nKind of so perfect here right\nSo let me understand just before midterms all of these far right is decide that now is a good time to commit violence\nUm [noise]\nI mean this this is the smells so bad to me\nBut who knows I mean maybe these people are I mean they're obviously crazy people but I mean maybe it's just what it looks like maybe these guys are triggered an or going out of their committing these things I mean look I'm sure that people on the left goes this has to be a conspiracy theory\nWhen you see people like banging on the on the Supreme Court justices or doors right or if you or or when you see these mobs go out and and masks and stuff they must be like this can't be a real thing or the caravan\nRight coming across they must be like this can't be real this has to be set up but I guess people in the world are just crazy\nThe difference is that I don't blame people for kind of thinking that there could be something up with this because it does seem just such odd timing\nAnd these people cannot think that it's helping their costs to do this well look here's another story suspicious package mailed Cory Booker this was yesterday on that this happened\n[laughter] and this is right above the article that says eleven days until the mid term elections where things stand\nAnd here's another article Eighteen news mail bomb investigation collide with mid term the final week or maybe I spoke too soon maybe they're not going to get out of the cycle although this is from yesterday we'll see if it stays that I Hope the news has enough manpower to cover all these October surprises\nBut you know what they're going to be a thousand October surprise as it doesn't matter because it doesn't change the fact\nThat the Democrats in the country want to take control and money away from the people and they want to give it to the government and the Republicans up sensibly I understand the establishment there but the philosophy of the Republicans is to keep all of this in the hands of the people and to make government smaller and smaller and that's\nAnd find any them in any school of thought when I get that natural life more passive they found that mechanic alike and a nation where it correct and continue to solve that meeting directly responsible for all organic functions\nFurther they believe that may paying an important sign an illness as a result of internal strife now this brings up a blessed von holler\nHe was
