Obama carefully made certain both our military and our police had been\nInfected with these retroviruses called ultra liberals\nIn law enforcement it's almost a misnomer\nHow can you be an ultra liberal and be a law enforcement\nWhat does that mean you're going to selectively not enforce the law if you like the politics of those breaking the law is that what it means yes that's what it means to Eric Holder\nSo now we are seeing the world when that was unleashed upon us by the Obama holder team too far we got a two for out of them okay so now we have a new president what can they actually do about this I'll tell you what's he's going to mark the market day down\nI told you that I Lived through the Vietnam War protests I saw the organizations and how they worked I saw the Chicago Seven trials\nI Know the whole story of the Abbey Hoffman's on the other ... I saw the operate I saw what they did that this country\nAnd now we have Bernie Sanders and others trying to recreate the very same thing\nBernie Sanders the communist Bernie Sanders the\n... of the devil and Carl Marx himself in my opinion trying to stir up a massive communist revolution in this country with millions upon millions of losers and drug addicted children who do not know history not even knowing what they are doing following this pie piper\nWhat can the president do about it he can't do anything about it right now all we can do is try to spread the truth and try to explain the history and the background of what is going on before and it's too late however if we cannot stop this from happening what will happen is the mobs will overreach and overextend themselves\nAnd what will happen unfortunately is what happened to Kent State university once again history will repeat itself in a very ugly matter biggest law and order once it breaks down breaks down across the lines\nAnd if the entire society crumbles that's the end of it for all of us our water supplies will go our food distribution supplies will go our gasoline supplies will go that's what Anna Cambridge go and look at Syria during a civil war and that is what they want Hillary Clinton said that she wants to have a war listen to our speech so if you all think that you're going to be immune from it\nBecause you wear a Bernie T shirt or you have a ... a poster on your wall you're wrong he will hit every last one of your head as I said to be for the guillotine once it starts falling is a very thirsty blade [noise]\n\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen\nBoom you're just created nitric oxide American molecule your own body makes that fuels your cardiovascular health

the knowledge to fight back that's number one number two we need to know the law and number three we need to know how to defend ourselves within the confines of the law since we're living in a relatively low all this time\nThe hands of the police have been tied as I said you it started with a straight years of an artillery barrage from Morocco bomber and Eric Holder who attacked a police mercilessly eight straight years\nNot only that but they took every ... left wing lawyer they could find at NYU and Colombia and sent them out to every police department that they could get their little dirty hands into and put them in his so called monitors here in Oakland, California there's been a monitor\nWatching every move the very top\nAs a result is totally ... the police are afraid to do anything would you blame them that's exactly what holder and Obama wanted they wanted the gangs to run wild in the streets\nAnd so here we are trying to conduct a lives go about our business to be left alone but we can't they won't leave us alone in fact that's part of the dictates of the Communist Party usa [noise] they even scream as long as summer uncomfortable you will be uncomfortable\nAnd then they call you a white supremacist if you speak up to them things of that nature so what is your defense again\nI'm telling you right now including all of your pompous little liberals here in the San Francisco area who think that you're going to enjoy your shape and he says forever\nOr left wing losers in the bay area I think you're above it all especially those of you over there on the Oakland Berkeley complex you think you could sit in ... near at everybody and go about your business that somehow even though you're worth a fortune through inheritance or through hard work or through luck\nThat you're going to continue enjoy yourself and that the mobs that you'll have encouraged will only attack your political enemies you I'm mistaken\nYou Amish they can get the guillotine is a two edged sword and as I said to you earlier and on and on and on his eye proven mass hysteria which is a book even you liberals must read if you want to educate yourself as to a rational balanced middle road\nBecause it's a history book once they get what team started to fall\nDuring the French Revolution and killed every ... account the revolutionary they could find\nThat shop to head off every counter revolutionary they could find\nDid the guillotine stopped falling no it was a Thursday blade thirsty for more blood and so what happened next is what happened then Castro's Cuba\nIs what happened and Bolshevik Russia it's what happened in communist China soon the guillotine was dropped on the enemies of the revolution within the revolutionaries who started to fight with each other for power it was a pure power struggle then they started to kill each other\nBut again the blade was still thirsty\n[noise] do you understand what happens when a revolution has unleashed on a nation look at Syria how many years has this been going on that was a revolution that was a civil war has not ended yet has it if that's what you want in America over there and the shape and these hills of the East Bay that is what you're going to have\nAnd I call for middle ground I called for calm\nThat doesn't mean tower and as it doesn't mean run from them I mean stand up to them as I Do every day on this radio show do you know a chance as I take doing this do you have any idea what chances I take both personally and commercially to speak to you\nWith the education the educated opinions that I gave you based on history based on politics based on fact the idea what it takes to do this to navigate the waters I Am in the problem for us those of us would disgusted by these liberal degenerates\nIs that we have a booming economy because the Trump\nAnd so people as long as their food on the table they'll look aside at the pornography on television and people will say what can you do the cities are filled with crime and violence and corruption we see it every day in the Senate and the house we know it's corrupt and ah although people the average person is sick of it\nAnd ... and the crime is out of control in many cities to take a look at San Francisco where just the other day a so called homeless bum beat up a young father with this child in a park and nothing was done to him nothing human feces in the streets\nNeedles in the streets nothing that people look the other way because the economy is good\nHowever listen to me carefully\nWhen and if we have a blowout and the economy and I believe there's a winning and they're coming\nThe parallels I've given you'll between the wimax Republic of the ... or ... years in Germany and modern America\nModern America will bring about a fascism like you've never seen\nDo I want it absolutely not I've been trying to warn you against that I've tried to warn you on the radio finally I put it all together in my book stop mass hysteria will it become a big enough best seller like I said to the other day certain books have changed the course of\nSociety round I mentioned one the other day ... Rachel Carson's book to Silent Spring in the sixties changed the whole world made us aware of the ecosystems that we're all living in that one book that title alone did it\nThat was one of many along the way but [noise] um I forget the one that was done by Sinclair Lewis about meat packing and the meat packing industry\nOr he wrote a book about the ... of the Florida House that changed things in America and brought about the pure food and drug laws of Nineteen fourteen I Believe books changed society the jungle the jungle thank you\nA single book and change the course of human history\nI'm hoping stop mass hysteria comes along just at the right time but I Am facing such a headwind of a slew of books ... by people who have television shows\nThat have a round the clock publicity liberals promote their own conservative do not because of a outright competition they don't want to promote me but you are the audience that can change America's destiny I'm telling you\nAnd you can do so by talking about history but first you have to learn a little bit about it and that little snippet I gave it today is only part of it the rest can be seen and stop or a mass hysteria but I Want to conclude with this\nIf the economy blows\nA mass hysteria but want to conclude with this if the economy\nDown and there is real pain in this country that is when you're going to see the real right wing backlash\nYou will see and then you say it can happen now\nWell it is happening right now there's an undercurrent right now a ... on the current that people have had enough of this filth enough of this filth they can't take it anymore and it came to a head with a capital hearings when we saw when we saw the destruction of a very decent man\nYou know anyone who went to college and didn't drink\nBut yet we saw what they did to this man they stopped at nothing to destroy him and his family and that I think could be could be the apex of the of the uh the high watermark of liberalism\nI think it could be but the real flashpoint will happen when there is a major blow out in the stock market\nAnd the economy collapses that could happen suddenly than the American people will back a hundred percent strange and charismatic individuals who will offer it to save America and the worst is yet to come but can the economy collapse I'll be right back\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight five five four hundred and Savage eight five voted for Hubbard seven to eight to ...\nThe Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future call eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nDo you have sun spots at age spots well listen to her they from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Gen you're so sun spots director\nShe says I Love the Gen yourself sunspots director it as my vote to product everyday watchers sunspots eight spots and even read inflamed patches vanish right before you very eyes and just like Renee if you click recall right now you'll get the Gen yourself sunspot correct or absolutely free just to try and Gen yourself\nFor bags are puffing is watch those stubborn the sunspot Spanish now before you get busy with the holidays and those bags and puffing is gone and for results in less than twelve hours the genius so immediate effects is also yours for you heard me free again\nGo to Jenny dot com the article one eight hundred skin eight nine one eight hundred skin eight nine one one you order this week you'll receive Germany's luxury micro during abrasion for instantly radiant baby soft skin or an hour and shipping is also free\nCall eight hundred skin eight nine one or go to a genius L. dot com you heard me right that's eight hundred skin eight nine one or January ... dot com\nBoom Lloyd Jones industrial small more than eight hundred points of violent no training session on Wall street the Justice Department today are ... the sixty nine billion dollars CBS purchased about those stories next\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save huge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it\nCould be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that the significant and he has people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of Medicare and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why men is here it's so", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "10"}
