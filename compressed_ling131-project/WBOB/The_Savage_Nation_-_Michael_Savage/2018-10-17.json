liberalism ... orders from more dogs than those of us\nToday I consider myself\nOf faith [noise]\nThat was one of the most noble speeches ever given by a sports figure in the history of the world that was Lou Gehrig\nOf Lou Gehrig's disease fame he was a great American baseball player who was dying of Lou Gehrig's disease I ls and he went before his uh be loving audience to the Yankee Stadium and he gave that speech which is still to this day considered one of the most noble speeches ever given by anyone at any time\nAnd the reason I'm playing that speeches biggest Stephen Hawking has died of a a less and um we now learned today that he said there was no God in his final book\nI took umbrage at that for a number of reasons and I asked today on Twitter a few questions about Stephen Hawking as tragic as his life was because ... did it suddenly elevate him\nTo a position greater than it out of a um Albert Einstein how the scientist like Stephen Hawking become demi gods of store suddenly in all fields including theology it's the same question as Dr Ford being bigger now than Dr Freud how did that fraud doctor for Ford\nNoticed they called her doctor for they don't call them ... noticed that just watched out how the media applies labels to people she was Dr Ford everyone in that kind of sanctimonious talk for a doctor how did she become bigger than Dr Freud and how it can become bigger than Einstein\nWell today on the Savage Nation amongst other topic so I'm going to talk about everything you wanted to know about Lou Gehrig's disease and more\nAnd the reason I'm going to do that is\nBecause as I said Stephen Hawking died a while ago and now we're being told today that uh he declared in his final book God is not that he or she never existed in the first place CNN reporter he said no one directs the universe\nNow it disturbed me for a number of reasons why should his thoughts on guard meaning as atheistic thoughts on the non existence of God suddenly supersede that of all of humanity from the beginning of the logical his jury or shouldn't\nBut you'll notice how the media is playing this great role and I asked the question today why is Stephen Hawking considered such a world genius well\nBecause she pushed global warming any now we learned he said there was no God he's an atheist group\nAnd I want to discuss his disease a alas today\nFor two reasons one because of what he said there was no God and we can then segue into what is a a less and other neurological diseases diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's now if you're young you're probably not interested in this because you forget your immune than you are immortal and you're never going to be affected by disease that's okay everyone thinks they're immortal\nAre just as

B. O. V.\n\nThere goes the audience\nAnd they'll rally as it goes Ninety percent of the listeners the haters [noise]\nIf Mozart or lie would he be given a tour of the oval office\nWith the liberal media pay attention to Mozart in the White House\nNow\nBecause there aren't that many classical music lovers so therefore Mozart as irrelevant [noise]\nThat's the world we're living in so if I wake up in the morning and I play certain music it's not only classical don't get me wrong I mean I've known for listening to jazz rock and roll you name it\nBut if I if I really can't if I don't really feel good I play classical music because it humbled me to the point where I Am going to break down inside saying that's impossible at a human being could have lived on this Earth like Mozart\nAnd had a brain that was like that that could conceive music like that to me it's as ... as close as you're ever going to get to God\nAnd it goes back to the fact that there are differences between people and unfortunately for us we're living in a time where everyone thinks they're equal to everyone else because of social media that's the tragic truth\nIf you saw the kind of idiots who are on Twitter or on Facebook to comment on things they do nothing about but because they can fire up a one liner suddenly they're equal to the greatest scientist on earth in fact they're better and this is the problem with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true\nAnd with social media you could say it's very democratic and levels the playing field no the opposite is true they haven't qualified to comment at all it's like having a moron in the classroom let's say if you're a teacher and having an idiot in the back who keeps interrupting you\nAnd makes the class pay attention to him because he's got a big mouth and interrupts the teacher so no one learns anything trust me I Know what it's like to be a teacher I Know it's like that but he gets in the classroom will disrupt the class but because of the breakdown of our society and all standards at all forms in every aspect\nOur lives no one knows what's right or wrong anymore very few people do anyway they don't know north from South east from west truth from fall so good from bad\nAnd so therefore if you go on the social media anymore on to take a picture of themselves and now they're more famous than the ... people probably know strip and more than they do Albert Einstein\nI Would say that um the stripper who's attacking Donald Trump is better known today than let's say Martha Washington or something like that ... you see where I'm coming from so anyway to make a long story short so I'm I'm listening to Lou Gehrig sorry I'm listening to the Mozart and I see the article that Steven ... the guy in a wheelchair\nVery tragic don't get me wrong I'm not ... disease it's very tragic disease\nBut it does not make him the genius on every subject on the planet including the kicking the guts today he said that his last book that we just got a glimpse at that I there is no God well I don't get what he said\nHe's one of billions of people said I said something about God but why why is that when I got more than an ex guide isn't\nBut because he was a darling of the American left media suddenly because he said there is no God now all of a sudden that's a big deal\nNow I understand that it's not I don't understand anything that's all I Want to say so I tried to tell you something about cycads\nSay go palm the moral population\nThe relationship to blue green algae and micro toxins that are found in algae and lakes and ponds and rivers and things like that and how it might produce nerve toxins that are related to jail as something like that but it's a long topic for another day maybe I'll do it on my part cast you know what I'm saying\nThey'll come January this is a topic I could do for three days health I may do a regular house segment where I don't have the time to do it on TALK radio because you get you know you've got a different format it's like the way this commercial writer you've gotta you've got to interrupt in order to support your show you need advertisers let's be clear\nIt's a different story with a park as you get a chance to expound and a little more depth with a little more you know inside\nIf you get that chance but anyway I'm not complaining I'm just saying so here we are in the imperfect world try to bring some shots of perfection innocent perfect world\nAnd we're talking about topics that most people are not interested in because instead immediately shift to the word immigration immigration immigration immigration Doris\nYou'd be interested more and you you might want to actually you should be\nBecause I said today what's going on in this country right now with immigration is a disaster it's a disaster that I've been writing about for twenty five years and I try to publish a book right after I got my doctorate in Nineteen Nineteen Seventy nine eighty\nCalled immigrants and epidemics his after I had had six books published already and my co author was the dean of the school of public health brilliant man and nobody in New York would touch the book for political reasons that was then you understand how how much worse it's gotten here today it's gotten worse here today than it was then\nIt's a miracle that I'm Still on the radio but I won't be here in January on some major stations even though my writings for higher than anyone else on the station because of political reasons only make no mistake about it joy and love Savage Nation\nCalled five foreign service [noise]\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and oneself gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math that six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share\nBecause it's very serious that can lead to paralysis in deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a famine acute flash at ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increase in a a ... which begins twenty fourteen but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC\nI'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to ... vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits\nThey don't get out of there what you like to go to vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses so every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear it's unclear we don't do anything\nBut it's thought today if I may be a communicable disease really well as one link oh in maybe a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio and Tara viruses that viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM where the west Nile virus come from ... west ... does it say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much see what I'm going with this right well you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came here a great\nGrandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading it into the healthy population well\nThose are antiquated ideas you can quarantine anyone no matter what the cities they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases\nLike this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a diseased parts of the country I kind of sense if you have a house or apartment we let someone with a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good life just they were raised them in a kiss them on the lips the show a good good people they are that's how sick they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to you know there's a relationship between some immigrants from some countries on some diseases\nAnd if you're afraid to say it then you're not living in the Soviet Union member I told you I ran into a woman last week and then just walking around them all such from Hungary is shocking when she said this to me she said I come from the Soviet Union and she said\nPeople are more afraid to express themselves politically in America than they were in my country under the Soviet under Soviet rule I was stunned by it you're more afraid to express yourself at home or at work than the Soviets were under under under Stalin\nAnd I put that on the radio two weeks ago and I woke up and there was an article just the other day exactly on that subject that people in America terrified to express themselves because of the insane communist left\nThey're afraid to say one word at work for free they'll be fired\nAfraid to say anything about anything so you're now a prisoner\nIn more fear the ... the Soviet era in America today\nYeah okay well what can you do it's just one man one man against the world shoveling against the tide is very very difficult odd see if\nI write the book stop mass hysteria America's and sadly from the sandwich rouse the Trump which is doing well but not great if not doing as good as the comic books and the comic books\nNot as good as the comic books on the left in the comic books on the right people want simple books and simple ideas they don't want to read they don't want to think they don't want history all they want a polemic ...\nI'm not complaining it's the marketplace let the marketplace determined there's nothing I can do about it\nI tried something new I went from politics to a history people would not really ... I don't know where the books going to be on the list if it's even on the list after a week on I don't know whether you bought the book doesn't buy the book all I Know is that went to my local bookstore Barnes and noble they said they sold it out\nSo whether that'll indicate the country is ready to read something serious instead of a comic book or a comic book I don't know\nBut unless you have a television show on Fox News in particular and or you are lauded by the mainstream media as a genius and you have no television or radio show but you're on every show in the country books I'm a very very very hard chance to ever get into the public eye [noise]\nThose are the odds that like I Love it I've always like to swim against the tide I've always like loving love swimming up up river and I'm reaching a poor I don't know if I Want to do it anymore I Know is an odd time to tell you about all this stuff but it's already almost November I launched the book\nI'm coming to the end of this cycle in radio and the media I've told you I Would never do another political book although I'm being asked already please do one more on the presidential you can't leave us because the presidential elections coming up uh twenty twenty police average just hang in there for one more psycho I'm not so sure I Want to do it\nAnd I don't want to talk much more about it right now because you're going to ... that kind of I don't want to do the old Mike don't leave us I'm not trying to get you to do anything or say which truthfully maybe it's time for me to do with Johnny Carson is what I'm thinking as you know here's the funny part about how I work\nWhen thought start to flood up in my brain for my subconscious I listen to them\nI can only repressed thoughts for so long\nAnd sometimes you got to listen to your inner inner right that listen to the old dinner\nAnd I'm reaching that point well what is it really matter\nWhat is it really matter do I have to do this until I drop dead on the radio I went to dinner last night with someone who wants to give me a television show actually I don't want to talk about it was really so well you know there's someone in the media was eighty four years old who said he's never going to stop to lease until he dies I said well I don't know that's great is that an oval\n... there's something no let's say you to work to drop dead like a horse or the you know they shoe horses don't remember what do you dance at a dance will tell you drop dead\nOr is there more nobility and leaving at the height of your career at the top of your career I'm walking out and that's the end of it these are the questions that are that are really I'm thinking about it a but here's the problem I'm drifting in from disease to this\nIs the problem with that thinking I don't have any hobbies not really I mean I collect old cars but I have two old jaguars I don't drive him that much like a center in the garage and touched the carburetors you know\nUh I don't do anything I really like outside already oh this is what I really loved doing that's the problem I've given my heart and my soul to this for a quarter of a century I don't golf it's

today\nUh so I think we've covered that one for now I can do a lot more on it\nAnd it's interesting to me what people respond to one on Twitter or on the radio show or on my Web site\nLast night I went to the city I had a business meeting so I chose to valley autos on fisherman's Wharf I I Know the owners they treat me really well people think it's a tourist trap down there but it can be and when when you go in there and you treated like family it's different so\nI posted a picture of me with a martini my hand no vermouth please toxic\nAnd my book stop mass hysteria next to me on the table and you know I got as much response to that as I did on on some intel intellectual subjects that post on ... on where they were like pictures\nI like to take pictures of me with a like a drink in my hand I become one of my favorite things it's hard to manage\nThe cameras in the right hand now the drink and the left on the table if the light is just right it's a beautiful picture the light

like fruiting you drink\nGenerally no I never let any of those stuff going on because they touch it with their hands I don't let it you know what I'm saying\nI Know and I'm no no no no fruit you if you don't mind raw food I'll go to a fruit stand but I there's a piece of lime as er I like to eat the olive after I drink drink\nAnd then uh yeah you watch the sun goes down over the Golden Gate bridge and you look at the mystery and beauty of the world and you know the world feels better like a better place good food good drink conversation there makes life possible\nAnd let's not forget break music as I was playing the earlier today Mozart someone could share those and I asked really pointedly sarcastically Mozart were alive today at an age of rap music would he be invited the oval

reason it's all politics I Can't do anything about it\nThere's nothing I can do about the politics of the ownership of stations do you understand that I don't own the stations they could run Mickey

control over it it doesn't matter if the show loses money\nDoesn't matter at all that matters is that the agenda is push forward especially going into twenty twenty when the gear they're gearing up ready for the presidential election\n[noise] so the only reason you listen to me at all is why well you figure this guy's a little different sometimes he comes down on this side of a of a subject sometimes that and it seems like he does it based on reason not just on on a desire to please us and he doesn't sit for three hours saluting Trump\nWhich you can gag on that one because I was on Trump to them angry at it's the talk show hosts who thinks that that's all you want to hear that's the part that bothers me\nWhat would you do if if Obama was president and you had a talk show that for three straight hours it's diluted out great Obama was Obama was there so but I'm always great Obama shoes shine bright anyone shoe bomber was smarter how could you listen to that did you listen to it no\nNo the the companies that specialize in left wing propaganda\nIn radio one out of business and then when they lost their jobs they came over to the other stations and they started to get rid of conservatives taking them off the air you don't do any of this oh yeah it's a well known fact in the business\nPeople destroyed their networks by running left for propaganda are now running other media now did you know that even in radio well in one day you'll you'll learn more about it if it's false I wouldn't say it to you so how do you survive it all in this business if you're a truth teller\nThe people will find you one way or the other is that simple they'll find you on line or they'll find you on a podcast or they'll streaming from somewhere that that's how it is so is that that's the way it is now ... what are we going to talk about let's go I didn't take a call earlier this is one of these days I don't know why it's so good\nI Know why I feel good extra extra clear clear like Scientology luckily I don't I'm not a psychologist I knew one guy was in it early on back in Queens he went into it one of the nuts and the crowd he was like one of the biggest already made a fortune became a top guy and sign that I was surprised he went so high up in this thing\nBut he wasn't kids Eighteen everyone's trying to find themselves he became a Scientology I'm Talking ... like in the sixties and I'll wake up twenty as he was like one of the chief goal Rosen Scientology movement but I remember the guy to a certain things they said that were really good\nLike about headaches for example I have suffered migraine since I was a kid\nAnd he tried to have me image the headache and where it came from it actually helped me\nReally helped my migraines and self cured was reading Georgia showers and macro buyout accent I went on to the ten stage diet\nOf elimination I was Eighteen years old and I my own I found out which which food\nTypes triggered by migraines and I rarely get a migraine today unless I slip on that diet for me it was sucrose any any refined sugars will do it for example and I know why exactly because my brain runs very hot and very fast and if it's like throwing rocket fuel into an engine\nI mean that enjoy will run on it but you're going to burn the engine out whether it's in my brain was sending back a single I'm going to give you a headache so you don't burn too fast and burn up that seat this great feedback in your body and your brain if you if you learn how to listen to the signal and you want to understand that\nIf you learn how to listen to your own signaling from your brain and your body you actually could could lead yourself to states of health that you could never even believe were were possible\nBut and here's the bought\nMost of us have lost contact with these signals we don't want to hear them we we eliminated them and we put ear buds in whatever what he would do so I learned to listen to my body over the years it's not always a nice message but\nSometimes I don't want to hear what it has to say to me like don't drink ... shut up leave me alone you know I don't want don't drink at rock it's not good for you today whatever but I I listen to a very close relationship\nSo I took this andme acrobatic diet didn't eliminate should not sucrose insured my headache and the rest is history for me it doesn't mean for you maybe you love sucrose maybe like getting diabetes and cancer and heart disease I Can't stop you if that's what you want\nPeople do crazy things today based on science so the reason I'm happy today on radio is I was able to use my my learning\nMy dissertation going back to Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... study studies that I was interested in them and the relationship to Lou Gehrig's disease today and the statement by Steven all kinds of God doesn't exist because he died of Alice I figured it'll be interesting but do I know if you really listening or maybe you listen to a habit of reading I don't know you\nGot to turn off the list that habit by now because you could hear everything you've ever wanted to know about the administration upgraded is around the clock ham bat\nOnce that part down the middle of his hair and you know it's a terrible thing to be a good looking boy and become not so good looking and you're middle aged man wow I don't know what it's like to be like I was never like a handsome guy I was like and not notice and some I was okay\nI had my share of fun but what I'm saying is what if you live on your looks and you have nothing on any no education and no one no intellect whatsoever and you make a fortune and finally you look in the mirror and no matter what you do you have to park your hair in the middle and looked like a Lou Costello\nIn order to to cover up to the thinning hair and so you're getting ...\nIn order to ... to cover up the defending hair and so you get increasingly desperate to be young and you start breaking bricks with your hand\nAnd then the whole mess manhood thing comes up\nAnd the people while they don't call your tiny I mean that was a terrible thing to do with the president um talk about people in the media they'll call you tiny that's nothing to do with anything where those ties have to do with brains in what does everything have to be everything some people are in doubt mentally somewhere in doubt physically someone that I Would vote someone dealt with nothing that's the human condition what are you gonna do about it\nBut if you're in the media and you're thriving they start with your good looks you're a good guy looks and you asked us to stay in your face starts to look like Jerry Lewis after it tell us on a in the seventies and there's nothing you can do about it I don't know what that's like that's a that's a form of torture and its own way\nAnd then as the years go on the portrait of Dorian Gray gets more and more corrupted you know I don't I think God in his own way has a little way of playing with people who think that they're bigger than God you know\nYou have any idea what I'm Talking about is there any doubt there knows what I mean even talking about I I Wonder sometimes I think there'll be like if I run into people strangely and what's increasingly happening to me is that people have different cultural backgrounds of stopping me in the street like a\nYesterday I had a day off writes I go to a dentist or something just a nice lady said hello to me like she knew me showed up and settle oh she's from Cambodia and she said to me very quietly she said\nI Lived through those camps that poll ... created my relatives were killed in them and live through them and I was stunned the here's a living woman who have you looked during the street would say she's ... she's a liberal said the Democrats are always think that if someone's from Asia there were a liberal or someone's\nAfrican American there were a liberal or someone's gay there you have no idea\nWhat a person's politics are really you can't tell by looking at people you you just can't you know that\nYeah well okay like some cops for example a die hard communist left us you wouldn't know that\nThere are many in the military who you think would be normally conservative Republican they left wing comedies you wouldn't know that either so you can never judge a book by its cover I'll be back in a minute\n... joy both
