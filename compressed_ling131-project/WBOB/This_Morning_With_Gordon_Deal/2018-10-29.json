worn there may be more out there uh thankfully none have been a a\nActually exploded no one has been injured but the breaking news is that a suspect has been arrested\nWe're waiting a an address by President Trump to comment on this arrest or just to give you a reminder this began back on Monday or the suspect has been arrested in Florida\nA twelve packages there were two more uh out this morning a to a senator Cory Booker and to James Clapper former director of national intelligence that was also said to us that one was to CNN again I think there was a partial\nEvacuation there we

these bombs and or or potential explosive devices I think we need to find out more before we categorize exactly what they were where they fakes where they real about what we do know is good news is that the suspect has been arrested hopefully that is the person\nResponsible and let me go right to Andrew accountable for a U.S attorney Andy if this is the person responsible they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nRegardless of these were fake devices or not or devices that just did not work they were targeting federal officials are well known people former federal officials as well and using the mail service to do so\nThat's why these are federal crimes as well as ... crimes in each of the states\nUh start with the state's these are considered clearly acts of terror in in ... in Georgia for example we call them terrorists threats and that's usually the law and other jurisdictions federally they are the uh interstate transportation of articles use\nFor ... inflicting terrorist activities so these are both federal and state crimes and this person or should be definitely a interrogated in great detail or sue me he may I ask for a lawyer in which case the\nQuestion he has to stop but those are the extent law enforcement can get information out of him or that would be the best thing that could possibly happen\nYeah and it appears the suspect was arrested without kind of a fight that he's alive yeah um and so that he could be questioned a and find out more about this individual even see images right now on television about his vehicle or this happening all in a north of Miami in plantation\nAnd sunrise Florida which is kind of inland from Fort Lauderdale if you're listening from that area it appears to be and we knew that that was the post office the packages were emanating from was from that north Miami area\nA but again I suspect has been apprehended arrested\nAnd a two more devices intercepted today law enforcement instead listen just because we have arrested this person they could have mailed out many more devices so people still need to be vigilant especially those who would be a you can kind of put that list together and figure out who is a more likely than not to receive a package like this\nAnd uh I'm sure we'll find out more about this person whoever they are are they are someone who should be prosecuted\nTo the full extent of the law um politics aside here even though this seems\nPolitically motivated and that was an ideology there's a place where this American politics we have vigorous debates vigorous disagreements but we've never resort to terrorism or violence and full extent of the law the ... the law should be thrown at him\nAnd this person's has been a lot of time behind bars we'll talk about

J.\n[noise]\n\nJay secular lived this is Jordan secular appreciate any kind of a joining us to talk about the law enforcement\nSide if you are just joining us there's breaking news I suspect has been arrested in Florida for these or what have been called pipe bombs none of exploded no one has been injured thank thank God uh twelve so far have been intercepted to high profile people mostly on the left\nUm in some in the media or the we don't know by the way just because this person was arrested\nAs a suspect does that mean there were others involved and it does it mean there are other packages out there and so if you work at the postal service or if you work for a member of Congress we have people who listen on both sides of the aisle\nOr listen to be vigilant still because ah this person could have bailed out many more packages or before they were they were arrested they've been under surveillance\nFor at least twenty four hours or we started hearing yesterday about this image dating in the north Miami area and that's in fact where the arrest was made and a vehicle taken the vehicle was taken 'em uh one arrested sunset and in what the patient a Florida it's just kind of a west of\nSo ... uh Fort Lauderdale north of\nMiami we have a name a Caesar say oc\nHe does have a criminal record for grand theft I'm a criminal ... nothing that would relate to kind of this pipe bombing or ... these kind of it since we don't know his profile social media whether there were other kind of warning signs about him whether he was acting alone but I Do want to update you on that\nUh that is the news as as as we have it right now the breaking news of today\nThere is also breaking news on the care of it and I want to get right to the phones on that now they have been is joining us and the second half hour broadcasts were going to go right into the mid term elections were only eleven days out\nWe got a lot to talk about the Senate and the house and races that are changing or some favoring Republican some favoring Democrats were going to get into all of that but let's first talk about the care bad because there's some news there as well\nUh let's go first to Tracy in Virginia on line to Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you so much I usually when this all started when they were on your way up here [noise]\nWell I think we know that there was a organization behind this or that started this I've got that they're actually base to the United states in in uh in Oakland, California way below sin Fronteras which means village Without Borders\nSo it's a U.S based in geo that funds these caravans this is much larger\nThan the previous caravan that that we all kind of remember back in April\nThat started with about Fifteen hundred people dwindled down to around five hundred\nWho ultimately made it to the border more than a hundred of those were arrested for illegal entry some of the others were granted a their first level of asylum so they were allowed entry on it the silent basis or what it appears as it this group one of their strategies may have been in that case is to do the group down\nTo those who could make a serious claim for asylum but this is a again an activist organization based in the United states\nFor silent but this is a I get an activist organization based in the United states working with leftist politicians in Central America the different tiers this caravan is much larger\nThe estimates are anywhere between three four five six thousand all the way to fourteen thousand it's still pretty far away\nFrom the United states than but the president's taking steps to department of defense to secure our border and these two locations and even thinking about closing a border crossings using the executive order we fought so hard for on on uh the immigration and visa yeah a couple of\nThings during the first of all on the origins of the Caribbean I think it's crystal clear in this case to ... there were a lot of political motives of from the left it for the origins of this\nA Caribbean but still even so he leaves the United states in the in the predicament of having to sort through what the group looks like in the end whenever approaches the border so you're going to have\nA certainly people that should not be allowed into the United states then you're going to have people that will claim asylum those will have to be processed\nAccording to the law by the way there are some some statutory changes that probably need to be made but it is incumbent on the president to use all of the leverage that is available to him you mentioned the executive order he's already engaging the national guard the military to go down to the border of course he's also said that he would be denying foreign aid to countries that don't cooperate with us\nAnd Jordan I think maybe most importantly he has to distinguish between the countries that this caravan is passing through that might have the capacity to work with us to stop it I mean\nYou know Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they really didn't have a capacity to stop this hair ban\nBut Mexico does and you had seen the president engage the Mexican government\nOr their ... seems like they're cooperating it seems like the the it'd be goal here is to stop the caravan before I get here because Jordan if and when a group does get here the United states will have an obligation to sort through whoever's there if the borders not shut down and determine who might have a legal point and\nThey were talking about the legal claim for asylum right on which is different than immigration law and asylum you have to prove that your life is in jeopardy and you've got to have evidence of that\nYou also have to prove that the countries that you pass through we're not safe\nSo it's supposed to be the the first safe country you get to outside of your home country if you're looking for asylum is where you were supposed to declare asylum that's under the un standards of international law and US law so if you were someone fleeing Honduras because there's a specific threatened under us and you got to a town in Mexico\nOr city in Mexico you should be claiming asylum there\nAnd the Mexican authorities would then go through that process about whether or not you meet the qualifications now we know people want to get to the U.S and we have allowed a I think the walls are not tough enough\nPeople to keep crossing through multiple countries and then heading to our border and making an asylum claim and ... and say well you know I didn't really want these other places I couldn't be safe either in some cases individual cases that may be true\nBut the vast majority you should be able to claim asylum in the first places called the first place you land\nFirst place you touch foot in his outside of your home country when you're under the jurisdiction of a new law enforcement um and the new country or the new sovereign territory I could take your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to remember our second half hour\nWe're talking all midterms are so ... and your calls about that as well eleven days out from the mid term elections will give you updates on the key Senate races house races how things are looking one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one hundred sixty four three one zero let's go to Roger in Virginia on line for Raj welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nTank you face Rosh\n... and what you're doing [noise] of course to the things that I kept comments on it specifically because this is also [noise]\n... but it being used in horse and miners\nYeah well we we know that there are a lot of our department of homeland security\nHas reported that there are known criminals gang elements middle Easterners or people who are not from Central American I just said and obviously those who would use a caravan like this to take advantage of it for bad any legal purposes and you're talking about the disease issue there's this these are all issues you have to face\nIf it makes it to your border and you decide to open those crossings to process the applications let me try to grab one more call quickly before we go into our our next break Laurie in a Arkansas on line one Lorrie welcome to Jay secular life\nAll right thanks for taking my call Troy scale Hitler any opportunity for the United nations to get involved to protect our border\n[noise] I don't think we want the un\nInvolves on protecting our borders they they get involved with their regional military conflicts like between two countries are not when the country should be able to work together\nLike the U.S and Mexico to deal with this so they're involved in Lebanon Israel border and Gaza Israel is places like that\nAt least in Africa not where two allies\nWere together so let's not get the UN involved much handle this between us and Mexico working together and hopefully long before this caravan reaches [noise] our southern border we come back mid term elections eleven days away politics get your calls in one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth [noise]\nIt's a critical time for nationwide I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for lunch or has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the OJ daughter\nThe reason New Jersey tells such a story across the landscape the United States Senate is because the Democrats Jordan cannot afford to lose a single seat that they currently occupy and then they need to a U.S essentially sweep the competitive races that the Republicans\nAre defending if they're losing New Jersey Jordan it tells me that they are going to lose a lot of seats that they're holding and likely would not flip any that the Republicans are holding so you could be looking at a scenario where Republicans have fifty four fifty five fifty six\nFifty seven seats in the United States Senate if Bob Menendez is anywhere on the map Jordan the Democrats are in a lot of trouble in the United States Senate\nAnd if if the house where to go Democrat but you have that kind of Republican majority of the Senate it does give Republicans a lot more power bargaining power along with the president who's a Republican in the White House the executive branch\nUh to to deal I mean if you want to get things done first of all the Senate handles all the confirmations of officials and judges so it would not impact that if the house goes Democrat\nBut legislation obviously you want to be able to legislate get budgets through make changes make fixes there's some big issues like immigration is well there'll be a lot tougher with the Democrat majority but we're not there yet I mean I Want to stay on the Senate first let's move to North Dakota this is one\nYou say is is so key because I'm basically you wouldn't North Dakota that you know\nThe GOP at least keeps the Senate majority\nIn North Dakota is the reason that I'm convinced that the Republicans are going to keep the United States Senate is just a matter of margin and here's why Jordan because Republicans come in with a fifty one to forty nine a seat advantage I think there are only two seats that that the Democrats still have a chance to pull away from the Republicans that's in Arizona and Nevada\nSo then if they held every other seat that they have Jordan or they would only have a one seat majority well I think they're going to lose the seat in North Dakota I think Heidi Heitkamp is going to lose the congressman Kevin Cramer\nAgain like we talked about New Jersey the numbers are just moving rapidly in his direction the difference here Jordan is he is moving from a close race to a blowout raised in his favor as opposed to what Bob Menendez is doing which is closing the gap so I think\nThat is going to be a be a flip to the Republicans and then if they if the Democrats when every other ... competitive seat on the map it would be a fifty fifty spread for Republicans and vice president Pence would cast a tie breaking\nVote let me tell you something folks you are a politically in touch audience that were they want to hear from you or eleven days out have you\nTaken part in the early voting uh what do you sensing in your own state as you watch or even across the country because we can all see kind of what's happening as we're national broadcast in different places but we'd love to hear from you one eight hundred six eight four\nThirty one ten or you've vigorously backing candidates have you already voted are you talking to your friends and family about where do you get the sense that the momentum is is it by Republicans that behind Democrats and a lot of that will depend on\nWhere you happen to live and sometimes it's you know where you happen to live in what part of the state or what part of a city that you happen to live and give us a call we really want your thoughts on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one time we know you all enjoy discussing politics and we have an opportunity to do it here was eleven days until the very important\nMid term elections so we talked about North Dakota Tennessee in Texas these were two states than the Democrats really had their eyes on in Tennessee\nIt was in the Senate race it was a Phil Bredesen or former governor a running as a supposedly ... moderate Democrat versus a congresswoman a Marsha Blackburn a well known to people who are Fox News and conservative in the conservative world\nThat race was looking very tight and President Trump came down\nCabinet news came out reticent tried to play this oh I Would vote for capital his staff got caught on camera saying he just said that for politics you added those two things together trumping down there\nHis staff being caught saying he wouldn't actually voted for Kavanaugh ... he was just saying they have to get elected and the poll numbers there have gone very strongly in favor of marsh apply for the momentum is behind the Republicans and there and the Republican gubernatorial candidate they're also so they they have a lot of 'em it's up to\nYou know for the first of all globally and those two states Jordan tendency in Texas I think these were the two states that Democrats were trying to broaden the playing field on we talked about how Arizona and Nevada look like they're they're only to pick up opportunities at this point\nI think Democrats were hoping that Tennessee in Texas would be places where they could at games and then we might get to Texas in a minute but I think that's why you've seen some of the fundraising numbers there\nAre but look Phil Bredesen or Jordan I'm just going to call it like I see it I I think he was running a strong campaign and then made a fatal mistake I think Tennessee voters\nA stand firmly behind a President Trump's a Supreme Court list I think they they stood behind the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd they were glad to hear that Phil Bredesen was going to vote for him and then it was revealed that that was just a political statement and he was making it when in reality if he'd been in the United States Senate there was almost no indication\nThat he would do it in fact his staff admitted that he probably wouldn't\nDuring the I think that probably was the last nail in the political cough and for for Phil Bredesen\nNow that would say whether we're talking about Tennessee or Texas or any of these states because of what you just described about at a early voting no matter what we say or anyone else you cannot take any of these races for granted because during that will tell you this there will be one state\nThat will surprise everybody on the map and I can't tell you where that will be so no matter what we say here you don't take any of these states for\nI mean listen in most polls Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee running for Senate against practice and has got like a six point lead one still has brought us in a recent poll with one point lead and other shows like her with a fourteen partly as stamps that people were voted early maybe before that British and controversy about Kavanaugh\nSo favor certainly going in Marsha Blackburn is direction and in the gubernatorial race there favoring the Republican is well Billy uh in that race so again it looks like that is no longer really in play\nFor the Democrats will tell you full breath says a lot of resources so he's up on TV there in Tennessee and we'll be through election day\nDon't take anything for granted polls are polls they just had to give you the sense of momentum you could see when things have really shifted it certainly hasn't Tennessee and let's go to Texas day into because that was another one where a again a very liberal\nThe and let's go to Texas day into because that was another one where a again a very liberal congressman or a ... a has a mass\nThis huge campaign war chest a but President Trump came down a things got a little more serious and now Ted Cruz's every single poll has got a lead outside the margins just barely but outside the margin\nYeah look anytime you raise funds like better or cash it's going to be a race that deserves a lot of attention because these are going to be all over the airwaves you national money pouring in a you know the ability to have aggressive get out the vote\nA key bay so did the dollars that bed or raise really were remarkable Jordan but look a in a in a in an environment where it's the state that is probably the most concerned about border security I think his position on immigration and\nAnd the borders and the wall is probably going to prove a politically fatal to him as well so look I think the polling their shows Ted Cruz opening up a six to eight\nA vote lead a I think at the end of the day he will carry that seat but look you if you're living in Texas Jordan you are going to see commercials nonstop because Beto O'Rourke has dollars to spend like we've never seen before\nA couple of states that we will get to give you a preview Arizona Nevada these are really a seats that are running margin of error is very tight races there or we will talk about when we come back and we had a quick question is Ted Cruz is sit on Facebook doing enough to be\n... it looks like he is I mean partnering with President Trump also has a big campaign war chest that he's got a lot of money to spend in these final days in early voting and all that but it's printing and Ted Cruz's direction he'll continue to work hard we know Senator Cruz well he's going to take anything for granted but I Do believe he will\nCarry the day there's nowhere eleven days out\nFrom the election in bed or certainly put together something if you will be right back\nIt's a historic move now
