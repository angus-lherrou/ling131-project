then if you are making the judge maintenance ruining now chief counsel for the American Center for law and justice ...\nWhat everybody is today we'd been waiting for the day I Know many of\nYou've been praying for and that is pastor Andrew Brunson\nWas released from Turkish custody now\n... there's a process says we're on with you live here but I Will call on route to the United states but that route is going to take a couple a third one is still in Turkey will be leaving turkey later this evening and then probably\nFlown to a military base in Germany that's really how it goes and then ultimately up to the United states that may come later tonight maybe the next day or two that we were kind of what happens once a a pastor and his family are in Germany and then evaluate it but\nUh this morning or the trial judge that was hearing the case after a couple of witnesses were put forward basically had Andrew Brunson make a statement he did and then\n... issued a ruling saying jail for time served time served saving it means here in the United states that is\nThat he was released a because he already served effectively a three years\nAnd so there's always but look folks it was a heavy diplomatic effort on multiple scales the first thing I Want to do is thank you all for all of your prayer or its support for best for brunch and his family them or to the president and and the vice president\nHave done and incredible job here the president has been today she sets the words that years with Fox News this morning\nAnd advocating for the past or at least a and a music all diplomatic resources available to the United states did that\nAt the end result is that pastor Brunson good relief also I don't want to ignore members of Congress bipartisan members of Congress surging\nIsraeli so Jordan that I'm going to start or do you what they want to talk about that I got a couple of states yet\nYeah sure I mean I I think it's a huge thank you to the White House\nPresident Trump vice president Pence the state department a secretary palm pay over their teams the conflict teams the embassy teams in Turkey and throughout the world who have made this a priority as we saw the president was willing to even sanction Turkish a cabinet officials\nOver pastor Brunson is imprisonment or some really a steak you to that Trump Administration all the way to the top to the prison the United states\nAnd talk to members of Congress as well a like a Senator Lindsey Graham a senator she who visited a with a president Irwin on this issue and a a a with a pastor Brunson as well so this was a bipartisan effort ultimately you had a the executive branch\nThe legislative branch of the United states working together\nTo see pastor Brunson released but I Believe ultimate credit here we're talking about people um it it is the president who made this a priority for his administration to get done\n[laughter] well that's exactly are exactly correct and in a situation like that you have to realize that I think we all do that\nTo realize that this was a team effort but the president did a phenomenal job are also members of Congress were frightened center on this as well\nYeah in the United states spoke with one voice on this and that's why it was so important for the president and vice president to set the tone but in the Congress J I mean scores scores of senators and congressmen spoke out on this uh Jordan you're right I think senators Lankford till is Shaheen in Graham\nProbably had the most vested interest may tripped over to turkey to visit with officials in the family but gee endured a bipartisan by camera effort uh one of the most impressive I've seen out of the United States Congress [noise]\nWell I received a call from the president this morning and he said I've got good news for you today and that is a Andrew Brunson is gonna be returned to the United states and I feel the presence of ... ball was how much reprieve shaded his efforts on that All right we're taking your calls and comment one eight hundred six eight thirty one dead\nTake those calls in common we come back from the break again one eight hundred and

today Jerusalem a biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now Amazon were born you know [noise]\n\nBack to the broadcast everyone and on on the road obviously but I repeat the call this morning from the president of the United states\nPresident Trump who told me to have good news\nUm looks like you're ... Bronx it will be coming up to the United states he\nGave me some of the details about that but the government has been obviously working on their release but that process would be going to two military bases that's how these things are handled but I express for the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member ... family are ... for his unyielding\nUnyielding are efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past and let me also say there are I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know a ... in several different capacities outside being killed jak but I Need to say this to my friends in the media\nThese reporters a for these uh newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matter of fact but very kite in covering pastor Brunson case and the story and that helped keep him alive as part of the process when you got people held like this\nSo the story and that helps keep them alive as part of the process when you got\nPeople held like this and um I I used to ask you what I Do this to a couple of reporters today I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh uh ... that's across the board here uh it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN or at covered extensively ABC News\nOr as covered it I mean I even talked about it with George Stephanopoulos\nOn ABC's This week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... products that are now being processed out of turkey and what that means is is that removing the ankle bracelet which was his monitor it was at a house arrest\nThey will be taken to a military transport aircraft\nUh them probably flown directly into Germany or be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly when that mold that will be yet we're ... into that but um but we'll keep everybody posted is this a progressive ... progress over the next several hours but a great day\nUh on any time you get these releases like this door to a great day we're still waiting for the one I was a baby\nThat case was earlier this way I Know this way\nWay out to the others but yeah that they are there were reports this morning that back are becoming any moment I'm Out of the pack and was a great day go head out of the Pakistani a\nSupreme Court that that case here or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered is that is unique it's similar in these situations as time served all the witnesses against fascism Brunson basically dropped their stories this morning in court in Turkey um and said they were they were they were not accurately\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL gene member today and it's easy to do the one line sign up L. J. dawn\n[noise]\nWhat we did my thoughts and prayers are with pastor Brunson and we hope to have them safely back home soon he tweeted a number of times\nI spoke out publicly a number of times for pastor Andrew Brunson vice president Pence\nA secretary of state ... number of us sinners tell us a Lindsey Graham a machine or ... and many more a link for other members of Congress I Can't name them All right now uh because again what we're focused on is that pastor Brunson\nAn American at a Christian pastor who was imprisoned in Turkey for two years are charged with Christian ...\nUm and ultimately fried today in court\nUm after a face after being imprisoned entertain a for over a just a little over two years old so first let me tell you story yeah he was he was there in Turkey for twenty three years\nAnd it gets picked up I'm back in October of twenty sixteen and he's scheduled to be deported along with his wife\nSo deportation facility then he gets moved to a prison\nBut he doesn't face charges until march of twenty Eighteen\nSo from October of twenty sixteen to march at twenty eight and he's just being imprisoned ultimately four months later in July or after being charged he's allowed to go under house arrest\nNow a lot of that was a positive development but not the end goal obviously\nHere we are now and October um and pastor Brunson\nHas been freed he's been ... ordered by the court to uh to have his passport return he can freely or leave the country\nUm it's been a order that he's it's time served a so he can leave the country he'll get his passport no longer be under house arrest that could happen it could be leaving turkey as early as this evening and I know the news will be covering that as well I Do want to make it clear the American Center for Law Justice we represent\nPastor Brunson and the family and uh and I just want to thank all of you for allowing us to do that your support to the American surf lawn justice is the reason why we can represent the family do this work and uh and let me again I just think the White House the government official stand\nI you know I'm taking our audience as well or supporters as well because that's why we're able to engage on Capitol Hill we've got the resources we have the staff we have the information and then all takes support from our listeners support from our members of the American Center for law and justice\nNo question about Jordan in this instance almost six hundred thousand of our members signed a petition I think the number was five hundred and Ninety nine thousand six hundred and seven\nBut that is particularly effective in two arenas Jordan first of all and primarily in the halls of Congress to get their voters who signed the petition by and large\nAnd so when their voters expressed an interest in that case they get engaged certainly it means something to the administration to although I Would tell you that the administration was engaged on this one really before those numbers started piling up the second place Jordan\nIn aged on this one really before those numbers started piling up the second place Jordan where those numbers are so significant is in the international space when we go to the United nations or to human rights council\nAnd can demonstrate that several hundred thousand people around the world\nAre interested in that case and think that there's been\nA an improper administration of justice as as we thought was the case for ... and it makes the world take notice to Jordan really all of our effort start with that grassroots peace building\nOr the support among grass roots and then it goes to the administration level then it goes to the congressional level and ultimately or to the international community's but all of it joined it comes back to shining a light on these cases in we'd do that\nBy telling the story and getting people engaged or many of our efforts Jordan would not be nearly as effective without that first piece being in place\nRight folks we are taking your phone calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one twenty a hundred six eight for three one zero Michelle's calling from New York on my for Michelle welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nThank you very much I orange chairs\nAnd so happy so happy I heard about this situation this year\nWhen I was going to recovery I got hurt on my job and I heard about it on the radio and\nOf course I heard about other people pray at court t._v. it and see the end and just to hear this year what God has died like I said before and it has not been for God not last what hurt this news today\nI just get God pray for everyone that was involved it president guess who who ever thought about this particular on that and not just themselves but somebody else's family this is what happens when people\nNo matter what they are a ethnicities when people get together for the cause look at what God can\nYou know it's exactly right I mean people coming together let's not forget the power of prayer here um which is very important power speaking out\nA church coming together because that's again and and then taking that into actually taking the face into action Ricci our leaders working with our leaders who are willing to really go to the line go to bat for pastor Brunson President Trump was willing to do it\nVice president Pence secretary Pompeo their teams are stash our embassy teams a consulate teams I ... at the senators the congressmen I mean this is a good folks that shows you there was an all out effort here\nTo see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson from turkey and uh and ultimately ... they they were very tough measures taken against turkey I don't want to focus on those today because today's day to celebrate uh hopefully\nThis will be something good for uh the relations between the U.S and turkey who our NATO allies I mean ultimately that's that's a big goal here I thought that the kind of bigger picture I even heard\nPastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that you shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important Senator Graham was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre thanks and how how important is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time\nBut a ... you try diplomatic options um you can I we had a White House and a president willing to take steps a after diplomacy or or was not working just to get it done even issue things like us or a targeted sanctions\nOn Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough\nUm how important it is that all of you stood by for those two years I'm a for pastor Brunson I Know he thanked shoe and his family thanks you and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four and forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states and certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows or something I'll be doing later today who ... who stood with this story\nI Would this American pastor because of his wrongful imprisonment I we've got a second half hour coming up on Jay's sexual alive written take your questions your comments one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero we'll see if we can connect to see\nHow it was well she's working directly with the Bronx and family one of our ACL Jay senior councils connect with her to get an update their on how the ... are doing [noise]\nUm [noise] uh both a pastor Brunson his wife [noise] children I Will do that or second half hour it's coming up we're alive one eight hundred six a poor thirty one ten pastor Andrew Brunson after two years imprisonment\nIn house arrest has been released\nWill be on his way back to the United states\nAll the updates as well go to a field Jay dot org followers on social media Twitter dot com slash Jay secular Twitter dot com bust Jordan Sekulow and of course are Facebook pages as well and they feel jaded or a lot of information to update you with and you could share with your friends and family\nIt's a critical time for nationwide I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more and more on them right now\nAt the seals were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional on religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now we see the OJ daughter\nAll of those names but I Will tell you this back on that initial letter it was co led by the for a chairman and ranking members of the house foreign affairs committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee so that would be Bob Corker Ben Cardin ed Royce and Eliot Engel and why do I\nMentioned that that's a big deal during because when you get both the chairman and the ranking member of those two committees have jurisdiction\nA speaking with one voice to\nA to an ally of the United states I mean that can be a very tricky thing\nUh but those four members came together agreed on a message recruited members of both the house and Senate to join that letter\nOr so so Jordan I Would do it would probably be quicker to name those who didn't participate in some level than those who did but again I Would tell you this by camera all bipartisan speaking in one voice uh in in one voice that was really led by the president they came behind that message and they agreed with it\nAll right folks as we now take your phone calls one hundred sixty four thirty one to the joyous day as you can tell I was we had been a up late working through the night a ... sticking with what is happening taking nothing for granted those mover\nAnd still to this moment even when I'm again I think it was Senator Lindsey Graham I totally agree with him as as a one of the attorneys working on this\nFeel a lot better when he is a out of a Turkish airspace 'em and kind of cannot breathe a sigh of relief because there's a lot of moving parts right now seen that before\nBut uh but it is a great day to day to celebrate let's go to the phones one hundred sixty four thirty once in large but hold on line from Kansas on line one Lawrence welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nFive things are going to be on there I just I wanted it brought a broadcast that I think it's amazing what President Trump is doing what vice president parents are gone and the amazing ... that have been out there and you know having served in the military for quite some time before he retired that\nTurkey can often be a tricky burger can change your mind pretty often and pretty quickly it was a very much provocation and\nIt's amazing to see the kind of steps that we've been able to take and then I'm not as important has been out there and what I Want to know is one of the owners want want all the support is out there on the people are focusing and all of the people who are working hard and can we really focus on Asia B.D\nYou enjoy your face in Pakistan that is that is actually\nAt Pakistan's highest court so there may be resolution they're very soon as she is not an American citizen\nWe actually have an office in Pakistan is working on this case directly so uh we are involved it is different when it's not an American citizen a but but I I Would remind you that that the United states government often works on these human rights cases behind the scenes even when it does not involve\nA U.S citizens and so in her matter though it has reached the judges the trial is over after eight years in prison and we're now awaiting a judgment on there and we'll be updated from our ... our our staff\nIn Pakistan take a listen to pastor Brunson sister on Fox News this morning I I think it just underscores the importance of all of you\nWho is this broadcast to support the worst the ACL Jay who call yourself ACL Jay members take a listen\nI think a lot of time\nTo get more attention to wonder if\nI can tell taping really pushing for a family I really don't believe we can trace quite hard time bringing home\nI mean that again she says it right there the ACL Jay big driving force and again\nI'm not a ... organization taking all of this credit what we've kind of do is it getting taken to government officials I mean the U.S government had to lead this\nWe set a number of times but you've got to have a group of organizations he ... around you\nThat ... that that has a relationships that can work with those government officials whether that is the executive branch the president the vice president secretary of state State Department\nAnd their ... their staff and teams or the legislative branch members of Congress as well saying I mean it's very important it all comes together and you put this driving force starts with meetings it starts with getting the information letting those uh empower\nGet educated about the matter\nUm and uh and then they go to work utilizing their contacts in this case uh uh many of those that had a ... especially in Congress long term context because turkey is a NATO ally\nYou only when these as a team Jordan and it starts with the six hundred thousand members of D. C. L. J. that made this a priority for them\nTo their personal time to engage to lend their voice to us and then we were able to use those voices Jordan you're right to go to the administration and go to bipartisan members of the house and Senate and go to the international community and demand attention on this but I Would say that even with all of that in place Jordan and that's\nA quite an effort it's quite a a a team effort but even with all of that in place\nWe are not used to getting the response from the apparatus of government that we got the time so I Will say that this administration and the state department deserves a lot of credit in that regard look\nWe've had success with previous administrations inside State Department's on various cases\nBut human rights cases tend to upset the apple courtroom when it comes to issues of priority inside the state department we never encountered that on this case Jordan\nThey were always open to taking this case and find that in fact they took the information from us\nAnd then actually took the lead on it from all the way from the White House the president set the tone and gave a directive down through the vice president who specifically engaged over the course of two secretaries of state down through the state department officials\nAnd then back out to a bipartisan members of Congress Jordan I Will tell you this I had never seen a unified voice on a human rights case inside the apparatus in the United states government\nAs I have seen on this one so as a team effort and it does start on that grassroots but this administration deserves an awful lot of credit for the way the United states government uh behaved enacted aggressively\nNah I encourage folks to share this with your friends and family and we agreed update for a great post on ACL Jay dot org about a pastor Brunson ... a pastor Brunson to release detailing the story as well uh people are going to see it throughout the news today will be on some of the broadcast it\nWell uh people are going to see it throughout the news today will be on some of the broadcast it serves some pastor Brunson Stanley already has been on\nBroadcast as well and I am sure what he ultimately is a return to the United states but did you want to take your phone calls you've got another statement coming up at one hundred sixty four thirty one to will take one more of those right now Murray is calling from California on life by Murray welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nI think he won praise God for this wonderful I happen to work out questionnaires I'm not that it maybe not even according to articles I can get a pastor Brunson was convicted of aiding terror groups and all along I've heard you guys say that he was charged with ... yeah\nI was just wondering is there a difference it's just it's just something that turkey came up with it they could get a charge\nFace I mean it's hard this is a face saving measures we told you this is not normal process or so obviously this was okay but at the highest levels of the Turkish government to allow for his release today\nUm you know he's still there so I'm not going to get into a lot of details about a a turkey and how they handled this but I Will say that ultimately they've done the right thing after two years and I think we could explain more of that\nUh once pastor Brunson is here in the United states that's that's why I Believe it but yes the the original charges including Christian ... I was just absurd a as a charge but but ultimately again\nTurkey is done the right thing US government has worked with turkey to make sure the right outcome was done we've got a final segment coming up we take your phone calls and your comments give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth American pastor Andrew Brunson is free from prison turkey after two years\nOne hundred sixty four thirty one ten we'll be right now [noise]\nIt's a historic move now the United states is do sympathy and Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nThe state of Israel and is very right to exist as a lynchpin issues not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies abound\nISIS among the law in Iran all pledged white Israel from the very severe in his new book New York times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem\nBiblical and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear irrefutable evidence to\nRemove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal miss purported bodies ...\nHere's your topic today Jerusalem a biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\nThere's been or mission for nearly Thirty years\nAt the American Center for law and justice were dedicated to protect your religious and constitutional freedom because of the many feel ... members who stand with us we've seen great success over the years as we engage in legal legislative and cultural issues that matter most to you when your family\nSeal Jay is on the front line when it comes to protecting your freedom defending Christians and their faith in this country and abroad standing up for human life battling ... abortion [noise] working to cut off taxpayer funding Planned Parenthood\nThere's not a better time for you to join the American Center for law and justice standing with us you can make a tremendous difference in our country has our culture", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "13"}
