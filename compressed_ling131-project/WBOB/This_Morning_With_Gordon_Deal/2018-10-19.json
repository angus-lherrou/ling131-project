in Jerusalem obviously her office in Washington on this Saudi Arabia and go over the next segments been a key ally of the United states and a whole host of issues and now a key I'll ally of Israel that does not excuse this behavior what is your reaction to Washington well\nI think the statement from secretary Pompeo will go a long way to reassuring Washington Jay because look this is a situation where you have to look at both sides of the coin or the United states has to come to its own conclusion based on the facts of what happened I think you've got a reassurance from the secretary\nThat that is exactly what the United States government is engaged in at the same time gay and you and I've had these conversations ... relates to turkey in this region of the world it is absolutely critical for the United states to have strong allies you have to have to engage enemies like Iran and ISIS and you have\nTo have it for the defense of your strong allies like Israel in this

and critic of the Saudi Government living in self imposed exile looks like when he went to the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul, Turkey or we just dealt with turkey on the Bronx in matter so this is all fresh for us to obtain a documentary we need for upcoming wedding he did not leave that constantly\nAnd the reports are that he was killed inside that conflict\nThat's raised a whole host of issues we did have Bruce on Facebook say why are we involved with this at all he was a Saudi national not a U.S citizen well let me tell you why because Saudi Arabia is a critical ally of the United states by the way that does not accused ...\nBut my palm pale the secretary of state has said that they give it a few days for the Saudis to investigate there's going to have to be action taken here on some level or either internally or I'm sure that the world opinion here is going to be very very bad for the Saudis\nBut let me give me the relationship of the United states with Saudi Arabia we pulled diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in Nineteen thirty three and that is when oil exploration began in the kingdom 'em by a and by the way I talk about some of this actually in our book\nAnd by a and by the way I talk about some of this actually in our book on 'em or Syria\nOr when we we have the uh unholy alliance book because it's got the Syria Iran Russia thing and and and some of that's discussed in there about the oil exploration that was going on at the time since and the United states and Saudi Arabia and maintain a baseline of economic and security cooperation\nThat has kept the the relationship pretty strong\nBoth countries have been an ally and opposition to communism in support of stable oil prices and instability in western economies where the Saudis have invested both countries were also allies against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the Nineteen eighties now the Israelis have a a diplomatic up sort relationship with\nThe Saudis which is was that would have been unthinkable five or ten years ago but they do 'em\nBoth countries have said been outlined in a variety of issues in the U.S Saudi Arabia were also allies and the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait in Nineteen Ninety One that was the Gulf War than us defended Saudi Arabia against the threat from Saddam Hussein more recently there's been a robust defense cooperation between\nThe United states and Saudi Arabia including arms sales of Saudi Arabia is the U.S largest foreign military sales customers President Trump authorize a one hundred and ten billion dollar deal in twenty Seventeen I'm so very very significant bear\nThe deal are included sign documents with letters ventures intent but it's not actually a contract at this point so some people have been saying that this was already done it's not the U.S had a long physical presence an advisor military role in Saudi Arabia we train Saudi pilots\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nIn the OJ member today it's easy to do go on line sign LBJ\n[noise] [noise]\n\nBroadcast everyone we're taking your calls them one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time we are talking about the disappearance and murder or a ... a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi Government living in a self imposed exile in Washington DC went to the turkey the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to obtain a document you needed for his upcoming marriage and did not come out\nThat straightforward joining us on the phone is our a senior military analyst Cornel West Smith\nColonel Smith you ... you started talking about this last week when us a and then you gave him an update earlier in the ... what's your sense of what's going on in my pond pales made the statement of what he's doing a he met with him he said he wants to get the Saudis a couple more days to investigate what what's your sense\nYeah I think my mom patio and the president himself are really you know handling this very well we need to be careful a obviously a if this is true and it appears that it is we're going to have to react but we need to be very judicious\nGive the Saudis time to to take part in this investigation but it's a serious matter Jay because I'm\nA U.S we cannot tolerate an extrajudicial killing like this by one of our allies that we support economically and militarily and it appears that may be and what happened then becomes\nWhat is the response of the United states and as I mentioned to you last week I think there is where we really really have to navigate this\nVery carefully because some of some bipartisan members of Congress are calling for us to cut off military aid in cooperation with Saudi Arabia I think that would be a huge mistake there are other ways that we can penalize Saudi Arabia for example the ... act which was passed in two thousand twelve\nOr whenever I think Russia invading Crimea is ... it's been years since two thousand and sixteen\nTo punish individuals we did this with turkey with some of their ministers went pastor Brunson was being held captive so you can you can put sanctions against individuals who are directly involved with this don't do a financial as well as you know experimenting entry into the United states I think actions like that would be more warranted\nOr if we cut off military military relationship with Saudi Arabia or it would be a huge mistake because they are our chief ally or an opposing the influence of Iran in the area as well as a sort of terrorist groups\nAnd also through back channels Jay it's not talked about much but Saudi Arabia has been a lot with Israel\nAnd I know I mentioned that earlier was I did yeah now a big role I mean that's inside they not publicly discussed much but it's a big fact\nYeah and at this point you don't want to to cut off your nose despite your face diplomatically so that we need to react to this happened and again it's a horrible thing\nBut you don't want to sacrifice national security and vital U.S Strategic interest in order to make a statement and in order to take a stand we need to take a stand and there needs to be repercussions for this we need we need to make a statement\nBut not at the point of sacrificing our national security concerns and if we were to cut off military cooperation an eight to Saudi Arabia we are actually\nUh you know hurting ourselves when it comes to national security as well as intelligence gathering a Margie on a woman said he's on line\nWhen it comes to national security as well as intelligence gathering\nA Margie in Oklahoma City is on line for let's go out and take Marty's call Marjorie you're on the air\nAnd really I thought the colonel just sad I Am a great concern over or do I don't think he's trustworthy so I think when you really need to get the facts all the ... and then ... cautiously with them and don't get caught and the cat\nThat that's going on around all those just cautious and straightforward\nHow hard I think you're right I mean my view is as anyone Mike Pompeo said is exactly correct you got to give the Saudis a few days to investigate this further up\nAn extrajudicial killing as west girls but just said is problematic on a whole host of international levels and also creates they may have thrown a ranch west into their opposition on on the world stage here with us if this proves to be true which he didn't come out so something happened\nYeah exactly exactly and and as you alluded to just now in your turkey is not a friend of Saudi Arabia and quite frankly a turkey is very jealous of the close relationship\nBetween the U.S in Saudi Arabia no one is more pleased with the events that are unfolding then Russia Iran and turkey because they would like to see our relationship with Saudi Arabia fragmented because we stand with Saudi Arabia in Israel to to oppose tyranny in the middle east\nBudge on the other hand uh this is a horrible thing and it appears\nPerhaps and again you don't want to rush to judgment that the crown prince is the one at the center of this and that so I Do agree with Lindsey Graham a ... he cannot succeed the king of Saudi Arabia and be a legitimate player in the world stage nor can be a key player allied with the United states\nUh you know if he's involved in this peers that and yes\nShe may have an internal decision they are going to have to make here\nAnd that is whether the crown prince stays the crown prince in that capacity\nThat is I I suspect that is going to be the distant now we've got to get the facts and circumstances but I don't want to for instance we got to keep a strategic relations with Saudis I get that Israel certainly wants that the region needs that\nBut you can overlook there still do who's going to be the leader of the world safe routes colonel Smith is saying is important but then that's why we're being cautious which I think is the word of the day here cautious but at the same time aggressive of getting to the bottom of this well there's a lane\nFor both countries to decide this ... I mean first of all the United states lane or they have to we have to come to our own conclusion on this we can't blindly take the word of of\nOf turkey we can't blindly take the word of Saudi Arabia we have to come to our own conclusion and what happened but didn't J I think it's very important for people understand what weapons saying there's a whole range\nOf very ... the United states can take if they deem that action is taken\nAnd I think it is probably smart to start with the economic state sanctioned or or talk about the diplomatic injury or restrictions it can be put in place by the United states shape because if you start with the security once you start with the military ones are probably the first country to feel that squeeze Israel\nLet's go to take a call here before the end of the first half hour or Joe's calling from Lakeland, Florida by Joe\nThank you for taking my call I've got three short questions first do we know for a fact that he was required to be at the consulate in order to obtain the\nGas to get in the Occupy that you had to be a charity to get the document he had to be there and he went there a earlier and they told them to come back on October second\nOkay that sounds like it was pre planned dumber did he have any reason to be concerned for his safety uh wellbeing while he was\nHappy had he had a criticize the Saudi Government extensively in in in articles so I mean yes um I think that yeah that's no question but that was he had reason to be concerned but but he took these acts and he told his fiance to wait for him and call friends would be not return\nThat's what he told the fiance I\nOkay All right well it pretty well answers\nNow shows on me and I want to go back to to the ban on this and then uh and let's that what stay on with us for the second half hour here began to go to west he began he's traveling today but we want to see if we can keep ... a month and that's why I think Congress I understand the concern but we've got to be measured in getting to the bottom of all this\nWe've got to get all the facts Jamie ... like I I think there is inappropriate role for both the executive branch and the legislative branch I think it's probably good at legislative branches spun up so that the that Saudi Arabia takes it seriously and so that it fully equipped to handle the president do to get a deal with Foreign Relations\nBut at the same time to read the constitution gives the president their responsibility to balance all of these measures so I actually think it's good right now that you have Lindsey Graham and others in the Congress or just sounding the alarm and how serious this is and then at the end of the day the secretary of state in the president's well they have to balance all the things we're talking about income to a conclusion\nI think it was and I think dispatching Mike Pompeo to meet with them was absolutely appropriate and correct thing to do it been canceling a secretary Mnuchin participation in the uh Saudi Arabia investment forum for some it was the right thing to do as well and I think giving them a few more days to respond it's fine but understand\nOr something happened and it's something bad happened here give me a Fifteen seconds on the importance of the ally here we got to remember that too [noise]\nYeah they are they are they're the leader of the Gulf states there in the Persian Gulf and standing you have to malign influence of Iran and and the radical Shia Islamic law city and we need Saudi Arabia or to to help us with Israel and taking that now\nAll right we'll be back with more and and and just about a minute here at a a seal wind hundred sixty four thirty one days if you want to talk to his ACL Jay down or just ...\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country in the world could be American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional on religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the OJ daughter\nSo our response needs to be strong but very very judicious in order to protect national security interest of the United states\nI we're taking your calls on this uh and your discussions on this our phone number one eight hundred six eight ... three one one zero eight hundred sixty four thirty one done let's go to Dennis on line ... calling from Mobile Alabama Hi Dennis\n... hello gentleman a second to make sure I say this clearly [noise] I'm just I don't quite understand the legal as you said earlier that turkey as the primary and ... ... ... ... station\nWe got we get where we're having a lot of trouble hearing you know let's go to Scott will come back to you Scott and Colorado go ahead Scott\nA yes guy status or your attention to detail on this my questions is how do you think the land is looking at this issue how they might take advantage of it how they might posture\nLooked in their eighties love this I mean are you kidding me this is a Saudi they're they're big nemesis uh Israel of courses or other numbers in the region and the Saudis are are ah a ... and the Iranians like this because they made me ... will bolster their uh impact in the region I don't think there's any doubt about that I made Wes I Know you can gr\nThough absolutely a ... and the ... on the line and less if Iran in the region or cannot be overstated are there in Syria or they're attempting to influence the political goings on in Iraq or their enemies of the Arab Gulf states\nThey would like nothing more than to see the United states and Saudi Arabia that relationship become a fragment it so that we no longer cooperate\nBecause it is the United states the Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Israel that really keep Iran and check\nI think that's the reality of what a what we've got here are my ma calls with congressman from Texas was asked about what\nThe actions you'd be here's what he said\nI I Want this investigation and go forward in my judgment but it's just based on my hunch I Do think he is not a I think he's dead or whether the crown prince set a roll of the key question here and uh I agree that we shouldn't just rely on Saturday investigation we have our intelligence community and the FBI look into this\nI think that's right ah I don't think you could just trust\nThe Saudis or the FBI does have global resources all over the literally global resources to find out what happened here\nUh you point out than do that Saudi Arabia is our largest security part and in the world in terms of military sales\nYou know the purchase more in military sales a arms from us than anybody else in the world gates worth about three hundred million dollars over ten year period but of course you know\nThat does not mean you don't hold them accountable again as we said over and over again I think that made you hold them more accountable but to to piggyback off the sound you just played here's why we need the facts Jay ... you've got to hold whoever was responsible accountable and he talked about the question of whether or not the crown prince had\nA hand in this day that the answer to that question\nMakes a big difference in what the appropriate response to the United states is if he was not there of course still has to be a strong reaction from the United states but if he wasn't involved that's when we go to the question that you've been those you know can he be the next leader of the country and yet you can't answer that question into you know if he was involved yeah we'll look but if he was involved\nAnd he is the heir apparent to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the throne this is a disqualify her I mean in my view this is a disqualify her All right let's go to Dennis is calling from Mobile Alabama\nOkay can you hear me now weekend\nOkay I just want to clarify\nThe conflicts in embassies aren't they considered sovereign territory oh whoever has that constantly\nNow for the purpose of admitting murder\nOkay that's where I work as a\nCriminal me so you know this is a murder in other words if if if if there was a murder in the Saudi embassy in Washington\nD.C to a U.S citizen or anybody else it's not like the United states doesn't have the right to to investigate what happened I mean so there's ... you're talking about there's this there's diplomatic immunity issues that's different than the investigation of a crime\nAnd it's a wholly different it's a good question Dennis what's a wholly different of your the Saudis are going to have to come clean on this are going to have no I I don't believe they have any other option\nYeah I Know I don't think so either and the reason they don't have any other options to the United states is going to see two a day just as a practical matter if you watched the coverage of this and how you did on talking to Dennis here\nUh it was Turkish police that went into the embassy now there's concern about what happened before they got into the embassy in that part of why the United states has to take its own look at the end but it was Turkish police Jay than investigated or after the fact\nI think what we have to realize is that the Turkish authorities went in there and it was there evidence tampering it sounds like it\nBut I think the fundamental question I think the fundamental issue is what was the role of the crown prince you need to find out the facts and circumstances what happened but but isn't the role of the crown prince in your view Colonel Schmitt the key issue here\nThat is the nobody else in the royal family right\nRight out obviously I mean and the Saudis are quite capable of taking everyone who was involved in this including the their parents' fifteenth person hit team that came by private jets turkey to do this all of them have to be held accountable but the political and you know national security ramifications is the crown prince\nWas involved or cannot be overstated uh it it de legitimize the crown prince and as much as we hate Saudi Arabia are they also need us I mean we were down\nWe had well we support their air force right now which is starting to the rebels in Yemen we they don't have refueling air tankers we provide the fuel for their fighter planes on these missions we have but you know a military personnel who use the Arab fills in air space in Saudi Arabia\nSo it's a mutual relationship but they all they need us as much as we eat them\nAnd I think I think you know the fact is the king of Saudi Arabia\nWhen this investigation is complete is going to have to take strong action in order to maintain that relationship and in order for his his government to have any sense of legitimacy with the rest of the world\nI think the credibility of legitimacy of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is at risk that's what I think\nAnd legitimacy of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is at risk\nThat's what I think um that there's a risk a and the needs to be investigated it needs to be done appropriately but it needs to happen and if the crown prince again if that's proven that the crown prince order was involved in this execution and that's what it sounds like it was\nIt that's the case he could not be the leader of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in\nThe world's eyes that would I Would do that I Would think is unacceptable a no matter you know whether the un takes action on it or not we have to understand the geopolitical consequences I'm not one of these ones going out there saying you pull all your alliances get your uh a national security teams out of there I think that's that's an overreaction\nThe reaction needs to be this is reflecting the legitimacy of the kingdom's governance\nAnd we don't want to put ourselves at risk we're allies in the region at risk by doing something that's not rational mutt what may be very rational here is the apparent king the Arab parents of the throat of Saudi Arabia [noise]\nThe prince [noise] is not the kind of becoming the\nLawyer if it's proven or if it's
