Pennsylvania Erie, Pennsylvania or when you look at this the the races that are up that I'm either could ah go as far as likely them to likely GOP and what's in between\nThere to toss ups or in a Republican seats in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania one which is fitzpatrick Pennsylvania seven which is open\nThere's a a a one that leaves a a GOP that Scott Perry and the one that is likely GOP or that Mike Kelley but still on the scale that might kill your good friend of ours on the leaves them\nA you've got a match up between two income is because of redistricting\nUh one Republican one Democrat Democrat being Conor Lamb he's got a pretty sizable lead in that race a Pennsylvania also has one more I chew more ah that are open Pennsylvania five in Pennsylvania six so no surprise that President Trump was there\nLast night at that rally he'll be heading to Ohio tomorrow\nAnd all I can to Kentucky on friday there are a it their tossup races there in Kentucky the Kentucky six a congressional district for Andy bar and then in Ohio or again you've got Ohio one in Ohio twelve\nA leading I'm a GOP that says Steve chatted and boulders that are as well as they likely GOP a race there Joyce so I mean there's a lot of reasons why the president\nVice president hitting the campaign trail this is targeted and it looks to be a right now than very targeted on house races\nYeah these trips are definitely house centric not even Senate races up for or a contest in at least some of these instances are Jordan but look I think the president's doing the right thing but it's because when you look at a mid term election like this\nYou always start with a delta between the enthusiasm of the of the party that is out of power in this case the Democrat Party in the enthusiasm of the party that controls all the levers of government\nOr during the best way to close that dealt to narrow the enthusiasm gap is for the leader of the party in this case President Trump who is a wildly popular in these districts uh to show up in a campaign so yes these are a house centric trips for the president probably the very best way to close that enthusiasm delta and I would just say this Jordan\nAnd you don't actually have to reverse the enthusiasm gap all the way you just have to narrow it because in most of these tossup districts in the house you're talking about Republican seats that need to be defended now it there's no doubt they're going to lose some house seats across the map and Jordan if they can to defend it just a handful of them they're going to retain the majority\n[noise] let me tell you something folks the rhetoric of the other side of the aisle the Democrats is\nReally increasing it vitriol including from Eric Holder will play that you will not believe what Eric Holder

Israel's enemies\nHere's your topic today Jerusalem a biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\n\nJohn on Facebook rice said if the Republicans can't keep the house but\nDo main control in the Senate would you consider that a win for the G O P listen to a few weeks ago maybe\nBecause it was looking like the city could be in jeopardy listen we're twenty six days out something could change that's why we're going to keep doing these shows an update you are not every day but we will update you as we get closer and closer 'cause things do change uh that have an impact\nA few weeks ago it was like this that it could be in jeopardy for Republicans right now it looks like to sit at a a is a is not that it is a pretty firmly in control of Republicans there's in fact there's talk of adding more Republican seats I mean David it's fifty one forty nine so\nAny kind of positive ads would be good now it's still very tight margins ... six days out so take nothing for granted a because so much connected so quickly politics that being said because\nIt looks like the ... is is we're relatively safe for now twenty six days out\nFor Republicans a ... really the victory would be I think than kid they could uh may take control the house even if it's this limits to march it's I don't think I think keeping control the Senate um or should not be so overtly celebrated\nA ... it's it's it'd be great it's obviously important I think for conservatives are especially with ... and things like that\nBut it's really the house here at least twenty six days out\nThe Democrats chance in the Senate Jordan or a really long shot him and you're gonna have to pull off an upset in Tennessee or Texas and then sweep all of the contested races\nThe Democrats are defending him and if you just look at the wrong numbers of the three five seats up in the Senate Jordan twenty six of them are held by Democrats in ten of them are in states that Donald Trump won so that's a very unfavorable maps and I think the Republicans are going to control the Senate and I agree with you I think they're going to expand their majority there\nIn the house Jordan um I think all the pressure honestly is on the Democrats day they assumed they were going to flip control of the house a historical data says that you would their bases animated because they don't like the president and by and large although I Would tell you in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they\nYou in specific districts that is very much not true in seats that they need to win so I think they might be over selling a their advantage in that regard but look the pressure is on them because if if House Republicans can maintain even a one seat majority\nThat's not just a victory that is a huge a monumental victory for them and honestly the Democrat Party or the demoralization they would take place in that scenario during it's almost hard to describe the\nHere to me is what is most shocking is the vitriol going into this from our former\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today easy to do go on line signing Jay daughter\n[noise]\nQuestion today and I'm sure we'll be asked this question number of times this is twenty six days until\nThe mid term elections question is will Republicans main control route remain in control Congress Senate looking pretty good right now\nA house definitely still a toss up\nBut I think it's back and play for Republicans are a few weeks ago it looked like the Senate might even be in play for Democrats is this the ... and the Democrats are almost certainly going to take back the house\nNow is this is still very serious if people don't get out and vote on the conservative side I guess what ... it's anyone's game I've been part of a swing elections before my first job in politics in two thousand two was one of these and uh uh again it was it ... Democrats are they really got caught off guard\nAt state levels at sit at levels and\nA and because of that\nUh things change significantly and they just weren't ready for this a wave that occurred so there can be waves sometimes though it's a little bit more muted that more muted and that would probably be good for Republicans which means yes you can lose a plenty of seats in the house\nAnd still maintain your majority she can lose than twenty two seats right if you're Republicans\nYeah that's right enemy look if you got to have to look at it this way ... basically have two hundred and forty seats right now so they have they are currently possessing a virtually every purple district in the nation I mean it's not quite every one but this is one of the biggest majorities the Republicans would be likely to see in this environment so look\nThey're going to lose some of them and that is not a lost the magic number is to Eighteen if they were to lose a twenty two of the seats that they currently hold and emerge from this would they to Eighteen to to Seventeen a majority or Jordan that would be a victory I think by every Republican in Washington will tell you that's a victory\nAnd that is definitely a victory and then the Senate I think it would be a huge loss if at this point\nOr the Senate term Democrat I don't see those signs right now\nA few weeks ago people were pointing to it that kind of change but listen let's be honest twenty six days long time in politics so we're going to do these shows to update you keep uniform if somebody calls or that we're going to start taking them right now let's go to pat in Texas on line to pat welcome to Jay sexual alive\nJordan thank you for your program and I think your dad and everybody that works there I'm Molly thing is two things they've all got to get out and they do is not going to make a difference I'm telling you that they're going to say don't second thing is you don't mind me asking I Need my wife\nWho are going to go and ... to find out if it's an Turner breath for my wife bought him very\nWell I'll get off I have had a he was\nCertainly calling for people to pray we up you know for everybody out there we have pretty often for our audience and I appreciate you adding that I mean it's a ... to be on the radio show in and say ask\nFor that so I'll ask our listeners right now to pray for pets wife\nAs as she's going through that and and uh and appreciate your call pat let me also say that that that is right that people have got to vote stay and ultimately\nA mid term elections are about voter turnout a party enthusiasm um and so it's a it's about who shows up on election day or the early voting things like that made it a little bit have made it a little different but it is basically about enthusiasm\nEspecially in the mid term Jordan I mean if you look at the issue point I think it will be the economy which is very strong for the ... national security which is very strong for the president\nUh that will be the top issues but Jordan any mid term the biggest factor is always which party is able to drive out their base the best\nAnd it is always easier for someone who is out of out of power because it's easier to motivate them or to to return to power than it is for someone who's a voter who might be complacent might be on the fence think that their party has all the levers of government so that is why just naturally politically historically a GOP starts at a disadvantage\nOr this year but Jordan I I think I think what you started this show out with their work which is the rhetoric and often\nBorderline violent rhetoric that we've seen on the left I think that has dramatically and maybe historically closed and duty as him get a in this election so to patch point yes it is all about voting I mean you look at the United States Senate the forty ninth and fifty a seats for the GOP before you really mean getting toss ups are probably North Dakota and and\nIt seats for the GOP before you really mean getting toss ups are probably North Dakota\nAnd and Tennessee or Jordan if if voters don't get out and those two states I mean those are not speech that Republicans\nA will will hold out in North Dakota to buy ads for the entire state are very very cheap it is very easy to turn out an opposition based a pet is correct whether you're a Republican or Democrat the enthusiasm gap it will be the determining factor in these midterm election\nYear I mean you mentioned North Dakota and pull up the current polling and Heidi Heitkamp is the incumbent she voted against Brett Kavanaugh a lot of people saw that as maybe\nHer giving up on her race but just to make clear there um it's the spread if you average all is about an eight point lead for the Republican challenger Kramer is North Dakota um some of even showed about twelve\nBut Heitkamp it's been elected before a there will be money pouring in I I assume a unless you can just gets totally out of hand\nUh because she did vote against Brett Kavanaugh is that the Democrats come in for that was probably part of the deal is to help help at least try a show a lead like Kramer's ... great right now twenty six days out in these polls\nAre it really is about the turnout people voted for Heidi Heitkamp before North Dakota they've never voted for Kramer so will they turn out in droves to stay in\nHeidi Heitkamp packing from Washington DC let's go to Tennessee as well uh Tennessee is one that um again\nHas shown to be closer than expected\nA between a well known Congress I'm In ah Marsha Blackburn\nA she's a Serbian Congress you've seen her a lot in concert and cable news uh she's writing for ... got great a name id ah in the country but also in Tennessee she's also running against another person who has great ideas and Tennessee a Democrat and they've Phil Bredesen who was the former governor\nOr he also announced a that he would have voted yes on Brett Kavanaugh no\nEasy for him to stay that when he's not actually in the Senate ah he he is a Democrat um he tries to play very much to the middle now the latest poll that just came out from CBS uh between just a a this was October second to October fifth\nHas black burn up eight so I was a a a big swing but the other polls have showed it a much much closer to some of the earlier post so it's really within the margin of error I'd still I treat that as a margin of error race than uh the end and and even in North Dakota treated very seriously because\nUm if you could hold on to Tennessee and flip North Dakota that's a big went\nWell and I would say just one thing on each of those races Jordan first of all in North Dakota part of the reasons that the races ... runs so rapidly towards Kevin Cramer is because of how few votes are cast\nThere I mean you're talking about only three hundred thousand votes a state wide in that race or a league can open quickly it can also close quickly ... or Jordan so you know the ... the adviser you would spend in that state can move a lot of votes\nIn Tennessee I I really think so British and got hurt very badly this week because while he did say that he would vote for cabinet if you were in the Senate he\nAlso got caught us some of his staff on under camera undercover video or Jordan saying that that was a not actual true that that was just a political statement and then if you were actually casting a vote he would oppose Brett Kavanaugh so look I think he did make a politically motivated statement on Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that video coming out really hurts him I think Marsha Blackburn was probably the political favors certainly going in any way I think feel Britain is in a while he's run a good race uh Jordan I don't think he had a lot of margin for error and this was a pretty big air coming down the stretch\nAnd of course we're not getting into all the gubernatorial races out there Tennessee does have one of those where the Republican is far ahead in the polls for the Democrat so there's a there's that also\nGoing that affects things certainly I mean all this all these different if you got a governor on top of your got set it on top if you've got lots of\nA contested races in the house level driving different kinds of turnout\nDepending on where you live we're going to take your phone call second half hour basically if you take all of a second half hour on politics don't always do this on this broadcast for today is that they were focusing one hundred percent on politics so give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we open a couple of lines up\nAs we go through these important racist can the Republicans maintain control not just of the U.S Senate [noise]\nBut even the house of representatives tough\nWe believe possible twenty six days out\nI'll tell you why one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten will be back from Jay ...\nIs a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important than right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nMember and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now\nWe see oh gee\nHow I mean this is a guy and and I appreciate all of your comments and ... you know I think that you get it to we're not telling people who to vote for here\nI mean obviously we're are conservatives are and we have a pretty big conservative audience\nBut we have people from both sides the listening and we're trying to educate us these we encourage everybody to vote to get out there and exercise your ability to vote it's a it's just it's something unique to the American experience that we have been able to spread to the world but certainly we have this uh this uh set up that\nMakes it so unique even though the federal side where we have the separation of powers\nThat you're a part of by electing um by electing the executive a leadership the president and also\nA senators and house it's divided checks on each other even with the legislative branch that being said the rhetoric I I Do believe we are in it a point in time morally twenty six days out I think that the Democrats are feeling maybe a little bit desperate fan\nAnd so the the rhetoric could actually get nastier up some of it will be localized some won't be as national uh but but I could see this really getting nasty very soon because um things may not be looking is good for Democrats like taking back the house for instance\nYeah I I think that trend is set Jordan I mean I Would say a couple of things first of all the the the caller talked about how politics is not the most important thing in her life and I think that's a good thing but look if you want it to ... to remain that way you have to limit the power that Washington DC has\nAnd quite frankly I think that's why this is working against the Democrat rhetoric right now because they do want to centralize more power in Washington DC\nAsked for the tone and how will that affect individual races I think you touched on it earlier when the when the leaders in the spokesman of your party are saying things like Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder did and then when Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are sort of your flag bears\nOr for the party across the country during these key races were talking about on this show today\nThat does not help the Democrat nominee I think those I think the nominees in those races in those districts are cringe when that happened so\nI Do think you're correct I think the rhetoric is going to ramp up but I think it had any direct correlation to why most of these races were talking about in the course of the last couple of weeks Jordan most of the numbers almost all of them have turned to towards the Republican nominee I don't think that as an accident I think it's a direct correlation yeah I mean if you\nIf you keep seeing that for the next twenty six days you're going to see more and more desperation from a Democrat Party who thought it was all but certain that they were going to take back control of the house I'm not saying they they can't do that at this point twenty six days out of the tactics to be really shifting as we speak and to the nastier\nPersonal attacks are and moving away from just issue a tax or let's go right back to the phones Josh has been hold on a long time in New Mexico just we appreciate that are you are now on the air with us\nOh thank you for taking my call I appreciate all the work that you guys do I listen to it as as often as I can every day if possible but I just wanted to make a comment\nAbout a those clips that you played with Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton it just to me it sounds like there are plenty of the finger yet and they're pointing the finger at what they're doing\nAnd instead of what the actual a Republican Party is doing\nThe I mean they're saying we're not going to Hillary Clinton saying we will not be civil unless we get power I'm not miss quoting or the exactly what you said\nUnless we take back the house or the Senate or both we will not become civil so we will only be civil if we have power because the other side wants to destroy our values as she uses that term but we're talking about policy differences\nYou should be able to be civil and have policy differences even vehemently disagree and yet still be civil tough uh debates and still be civil things they get heated at times but ultimately return to civility\nAnd but she's saying nope can't do that unless we have power that Eric Holder just says to kick them\nA ... and talking about conservatives I say let them keep talking like this because I think it does no service for liberals in our country it turns away independents ah scares away moderates um and and uh and then uh you know these key demographics like I'm a a a women voters\nOr things like this kind of rhetoric is is not good but if they want to keep using it\nGo right ahead I mean go right ahead that the Democrats label 'cause it's been pretty bizarre and even Heidi Heitkamp\nWho's got this very tough for a she's a Democrat\nOr to hold on to her seat voted against Brett Kavanaugh which made it even tougher for her she had to respond to what Hillary Clinton said take a listen to\nWhat you think about that idea that you can't be civil I'm given the the rhetoric coming from from the Republicans can Democrats ... Democrats not be civil with Republican\nWhile that's ridiculous I I Can't imagine um how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides that ratchet down the rhetoric I Hope that we can find common ground in this country\nNow saying that the moderate Democrat so called moderate Democrats who still has to do a Brett Kavanaugh didn't\nGive him a chance ah but they they try to play up the civility thing but yet they go\nTheir party leaders are the ones leading the charge to tear down someone like Brett Kavanaugh she voted no on Brett Kavanaugh she wants to have it both ways in this race because she plays herself up as you know from North Dakota where we want to be moderate and not too partisan she's just as part of it as any other Democrat really\nWell it's exhibit a of what we were talking about a minute ago Jordan that these kind of comments are going to hurt the nominees in the states where the the elections are going to be decided I mean Heidi Heitkamp record\nIs pretty far left Jordan but she's got to run a state where she's got to appear moderate so this kind of of rhetoric even though it might fit in line with her voting record nothing North Dakota and\nAre are starting to see through that especially after the Brett Kavanaugh debate it does not help or politically I Would I Would just add one more layer onto this door no I mean we've talked about how tension is good on issues here's the problem for the Democrat Party right now though\nThat tension on the issues of the day you know whether or not the tax cut was a good one whether or not the reduction and unemployment is as a helpful thing or whether or not the expanding economy is helpful\nOr Jordan there on the wrong side of that tension divide right now so you have to get the conversation\nOff of those issues where there is tension and onto something else that is is a distraction quite frankly that dichotomy Jordan that's why she's running ten to twelve points down on Kevin Cramer she might try to run away from the rhetoric but her record on the issues is on the side of of of the tension divide that North Dakota and I don't think are likely to agree with\nYou know we do in our final say we are the broadcast which is coming up just a couple of minutes we take all your phone calls phone lines are full right now but as we take those calls they open
