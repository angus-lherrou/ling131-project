Joe Manchin decided to vote against culture and let me read some of these\nAll the budget mentioned decided to vote against cloture\nAnd let me read some of these comments that came out there were the word temperament I said listen for that from Democrats here senator Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota she's a no vote now she was one that used to be that group of five ... than talks about always that were potential a vote for judge Kavanaugh no longer now\nShe says last Thursday's hearing called into question judge Kavanaugh's Kurt temperament she's voting no\nThe Washington Post editorial board which is no surprise opposing judge Kavanaugh uncalled for a no vote or says that his judgment and temperament would be in doubt the New York times just comes out and calls him a jerk seriously that's the term they usually call judge Kavanaugh a jerk\nSenator Feinstein says that he's angry at a grass and and the aggression so talking about to prevent she didn't use the word but Senator Schumer did\nQuestion the confidence to judge Kavanaugh has the temperament sitter Durban\nUm uh it's asked we put on the ... how could you trust his temperament center Doug Jones the Democrat from Alabama also\nAre showing it temperament it's becoming a judge and Senator Patrick Leahy a he has neither the judgment or the temperament that is just a sample again they're not going to let up on this folks I think that they seem to be made very clear to you that we have a time period here it's more than twenty four hours it's more like thirty hours\nWhere people like Jeff Flake and Susan Collins um are are going to be under immense pressure as well as Joe mansion\nAh from both sides but especially the left right now who is flooding the offices in Washington DC and obviously did have an impact on Lisa Murkowski so they they say it's\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today and it's easy to do is go online and sign up L. J. dawn\n[noise]\nAny right into the sauce people hold on already called right to be the show I didn't want to answer very quickly because people do just joined us throughout the broadcast\nOr Jamie on Facebook what was the vote count on culture fifty one to forty nine ah fifty one ... votes that leads to cap it on the nomination cultures that votes debate there's a thirty hours a debate that's already started on the Senate floor that's where the sitters get their time to talk\nAnd they had a final vote likely not by the way that plays out would be to borrow a early evening could be pushed back of course they could keep those to open\nA but sometime tomorrow evening that Saturday evening says fifty one forty died just to make it clear one Republican voted against a culture on Brett Kavanaugh that was Lisa Murkowski all the other Republicans voted yes\nIn what Democrat voted yes for cloture on Brett Kavanaugh that was Joe Manchin all the other Democrats voted no she only had two defections on from party line up for the party lives a one on each side one Republican one Democrat or we will go right to the photos that one eight hundred six eight for\nA thirty what Ted Stevens called the from Texas all lie to Stephen welcome to Jay suck you alive\nI appreciate your taking my call I'm thankful that you're supportive of religious freedom and I'm incredibly grateful for your support of Israel and Jeff Flake is conducting itself as if he's bulletproof since she's not running for another term I mean what does he got to lose\nSo my question is does he have is you have a security clearance that he would normally carry forward and trade on that could be withdrawn if the president feels he's conducted himself in the way the damages our country\nThat senators I get that for what they did he kind of clear they have would be for the time they are elected officials\nAre chosen by the people so it's not like government officials bureaucrats who have gone through\nBut we'll we'll process used to get there are so that would that be an indication listed a it does make it more difficult with Jeff Flake is it not up for reelection he was already going to have it a possible primary in Arizona people were not real happy with hip and what really what he became was a senator as you kind of moved to the middle\nOf throughout his career certainly felt felt that way I'm even by his votes ads out\nThat's why it's still a bit of a concert here now he said he's still a yes he plans to be a yes vote unless something else happens that was literally his state but after the cloture vote\nFor me that's very typical Jeff Flake statement at this point than and also what kind of concerts we'd because so much can happen to and what I guess we're probably got twenty hours left now\nDuring the ... exactly what he said before the committee mark up he said I'm a yes on Jeff Flake and then there was four hours between the time he said that and the vote was cast\nAnd as we all know he initiated this one week to life so I agree with you that say tenuous statement of support here here's what my I think my message to Jeff Flake would be ... back when you negotiated this one week delay what you said is that you wanted to see this additional FBI report\nAnd if there was nothing additional cooperating they came out of it than you are going to be a yes and then just yesterday you said that there was nothing\nOr no new cooperating information inside the report so I think the pitch to to Jeff Flake during his not really a political one it's one of will you be a man of bigoted or did you mean when you said that and now that you've got what you wanted with this one week after\nThe where did you mean it when you said that and now that you've got what you wanted with this one week uh FBI investigation will you follow through I think that's the pitch that people who support judge Kavanaugh she'd be making the Jeff like\nTracy's call in from Virginia on line one Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive [laughter]\nHey there I think my question was answered by Kevin ... op ed that yeah when I was like you know as you say you're going to do is he still gonna want this convention after all said and done\nAt ... absolutely and I mean all is said and done is going to be the next the thirty hours less than thirty hours from now so he used to watch this he he could have ... if he thought this was too much that would have been done earlier in the process\nNow you got to cloture votes you're moving towards the final vote yes things could change on um you know if they feel like they've lost a lot of votes you pull it up but I basically I mean these are very hypothetical that has nothing to do with why they're bred Kevin awards the position he certainly does he took another ... step light through your TV interview\nLike having to come back to testify not about judicial philosophy but uncorroborated allegations against him now he's written an op ed that appeared yesterday the wall Street Journal I tweeted out immediately I posted to my Facebook page immediately let me just read a a a little bit from it or to make it clear but it is clear he wants his position\nAs I explained during the hearing a a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial arbiters who favors no political party litter get or policy\nAs Justice Kennedy the state of judges that make decisions to reach a preferred result over the past twelve years I've ruled sometimes for the prosecution sometimes for criminal defendants sometimes for workers it's sometimes for businesses sometimes for environmentalist sometimes for coal miners\nIn each case I followed the law I Do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences about a pro plaintiff\nOr prone to fit the judge I've got a pro prosecution or pro defense judge I'm a pro law\nJudge he goes on his Supreme Court must never be viewed as a ... institution I encourage you to read the entire op ed he talks about why he was so emotional as well he says I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been thinking about that statement from Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that's likely true based off everybody that does break capital well is that the emotional as he he he's ever been especially the public setting a you know that behind closed doors but in public\nI might have been to ... I Know my total sharp but I said a few things I probably should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son\nHas been and dad\nI testified with five people for most of my ... my mom my dad\nMy wife and most of all my daughter's so that again I encourage you to read the entire off into the wall Street Journal I tweeted out posted on my Facebook page it's an op ed that was written by judge Kavanaugh I'd appeared or just yeah it was published yesterday I did she get because he knew that the face three attack\nWas not about the allegations the tip of it but as I read to you I told you yesterday listen for the works to prevent\nIt appears in uh all these no votes statements city that senator Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk or they're very uh get very uh\n... it's just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology et cetera Feinstein or anger at aggression is how she explains that Schumer uses temperament Durban uses temperament Doug Jones' Alabama uses temperament so does Patrick Leahy and plenty of others have as well that's just kind of\nA sample for you as well this is a good ... what company from Facebook talked with Saudi and one eight hundred six eight four thirty one too that twenty eight hundred six eight for three one was zero uh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that sitter jokes from Alabama voted no on culture\nThan Doug Jones just showed everybody that uh you could it at Alabama senator and a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party a so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been joined that for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he has not been on play on a lot of key pieces of legislation as well as on the nation's um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think he as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play or to the base in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town not listen\nTo him today on CNN by Nineteen\nGoing for Doug Jones is the temperament issues with space three the question is is space three successful [noise]\nIt's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote\nAnd just because you vote to allow it up or down votes is not mean you also we're going to vote affirmatively for dominate\nThe fish out of the first half hour that you should always allow it up or down vote [noise] I'm not but again this was fifty one forty nine will be back our second half hour on chasing you alive\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important than right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now the the L Jay daughter\nOr for Brett Kavanaugh and it puts him in easier situation so he gets to tell us constituents I voted yes and I do think that helps him I mean I'll be honest because most ... most of his constituents\nAre not going to break it down to well did he do that because he was it didn't it didn't really matter or not they're going to see it all to really as a I guess a vote now it would be different if he is the deciding vote I'm a I think he could probably politically\nUse that to his advantage in West Virginia\nIf he so chooses but they'd have to also didn't determine what could happen to his Democrat or support whoever base that is there a for him um and what may happen from national party as well so I I think just to answer your question\nThat most people are not going to say this is not stupid it's just how educated you are up to speed on this this is this is splitting hairs you know this is coming down to well did this vote actually ... was this a vote that mattered I mean technically they're all votes to matter\nWhen you add them up I mean you got to get to if you want but it's what you were talking about the single individual Democrat vote that pushes over the top and she could see again I appreciate our audience you see the great questions that come from our audience because you are all very well informed and tell you ask questions\nTake another one of those right now one hundred sixty four thirty one to that is one eight hundred six eight for three one zero to talk to us on the air Cathy calling from Arizona on line for Kathy welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHow dare I think he's taking my call Cathy\nI just wanted to say I think it ... very disheartening that the constituents back home that don't have the means to travel to Washington and it'd be kind of money who work\nOn that we can't be there and look at a flake Murkowski or who never right before they go in to vote and let them know hey that's that's what the people back home wanting you to do it\nSo I just wanted to say you know please I keep them all in prayer and I want and God to influence them\nAnd but please remember the people who are not just the squeaky wheel that gets you traveled to Washington\nYeah you know I've been involved in some of these a larger kind of ... what did you call them protester Vince in Washington DC on the mall and usually those um work accompanied by approach a protest or Vince whenever you wanna call it\nThat were happening all over the country so that you could say it's not just here in Washington but it was happening everywhere and this was a sample there'd be thousands of people in Washington but there'll be thousands of people in Atlanta Georgia and uh you know in Phoenix, Arizona I'm as well\nBut here we're seeing is one Washington is a Democrat base and sort of the surrounding area so it's very easy to get the activists on board to the groups are pouring money into getting this confrontation I don't really see it by the way I'm not really endorsing this this idea either\nOf Republicans are conservative groups um funding people to confront\nAn aggressive way US Senators are in ways also with the potential uh\nUh put yourself in in jeopardy of being arrested just doesn't seem to really add up to the values of the more conservative and Republican move but that doesn't mean you give up your right to protest or let your voices be heard this is just the kind of a\nLeft this way I think it's unfortunate that they've had\nThe kind of influence they have had a because it is such a limited amount of people that we're not seeing protester up the all over the country than I mean it is is it Washington it's pretty easy for the left to put together a protest\nYeah and I would say two things during the first of all I'm this is why the ACL day exist I mean this is why we put petitions out on any number of issues we can be your voice here in Washington DC that's why we break it down state by state and showed the senators who in their state is interested in a given topic\nAnd the second thing I Would say Jordan um I I can tell you from first hand experience I think calls into senators' offices\nOr make about as much impact as those as those protesters those events do and\nAnd I mean and this particular case I think there are number of undecided senators that are out there or they could still be called I mean if you're in the in the states for our senator Collins Senator Flake or senator mansion and you can't get to Washington DC I Would say pick up the phone and call their office and let them know what you think about the judge\nAlright let's try to grab one of the call one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to the children today\nAre we're not we're going to wait to the final say in the broadcast to try to take a lot of calls because so many people to hold on like Deborah in Arizona online sex who's also been hold on a ... you to hang on after your comment or question and I were to make sure we get you one of our books as well ...\nThank you thank you for taking my call and he talked about you're listening and for him but I thank you for informing\nUs than I Want something that balance and truthful and not as you know I Try to catch your show on Sirius Radio so I appreciate you guys as well as\nGasoline at the port in Israel I think the only true for a selfie them and I can kind of reiterating\nWith other people as fat and unfortunately Senator Flake is just like his name is a flake always hard and but I Know what I did was I think that my own and and called his office and all the time one ear constituent as\nYou know you represent us and I'm thinking down not Ken Kenny he supposedly has political aspirations after that point it\nHas some of these other people that are sitting on the phone and doesn't help the fled their phone lines\nYeah I think that was I think their phone lines are being flooded\nI'm not really the position right now I don't think I Need to give up the number because I think that what we've been checking and basically these phone lines for these key senators are are pretty flooded that being said as a constituent like you'd never absolutely if your constituents Jeff Flake if you're a constituent\nOf a Susan Collins or if you're a constituent of Joe mansion you absolutely\nUh have have the right and and if you have the time to pick up the phone call the ... you know the other side is doing right now\nUm and again I think that we can be limited and this I think that most senators have made up their mind uh but uh but again there are those handful remaining a Jeff Flake certainly is one of those who is still not been clear a he's kind of said I I plan to vote yes tomorrow so that's what he said unless something else uh is to occur\nSaid I I plan to vote yes tomorrow so that's what he said unless something else that is to occur\nTwenty eight twenty nine hours or for something else to occur uh uh that ... for Jeff Flake that can be just being convinced by someone like Chris ... I'm Still getting a pretty open ended statements\nAnd would not be nasty this and we want these people to vote in a positive way so I get I'm not going to cast aspersions on them uh I Do think that they you could say that they have been these are a sitter to put themselves out in this position\nBy publicly taking roles that they are undecided or feel like they're going to vote yes but they're not a hundred percent I'm at a stand up or down our chat that if you can't get to the D.C office called their stayed off especially your constituent if you live in Arizona kick it to the D.C office for Jeff Flake calls Arizona office\nAs well we've got a minute left ... when we come back we will focus all on your phone calls which I think it'd be great for everybody listening to um I Do that everybody can call it to the show but it kind of focused to get on\nA key\nIssues and these vital ... breakdown in his final hours before you devote to either I put a judge for judge Kavanaugh to become justice capital for ah for for a judge nominees to the Supreme Court to be voted down [noise]\nBelieve judge Kavanaugh should become justice capital that's my personal opinion\nI support his nomination\nMutt it hangs in the balance and we just have to be clear about that\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tend to get involved our final segment of the broadcast go to a seal jaded or two there's a lot\nGoing on and we haven't been able to get you on these broadcasts and make sure to\nFollow us on Twitter put her dot com slash Jordan secular there's got to go there as well because a lot of this will be happening over the weekend we'll be right that\nIt's a historic move now the United states is December seem Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf the state of Israel and it's very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies abound\nISIS among the law in Iran\nAll pledged white Israel from the very severe in his new book New York times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation in Jerusalem mikel and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear your review herbal evidence\nTo remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal miss purported by Israel's in I mean\nHere's your copy today in Jerusalem a middle school and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\nIt's been or mission for nearly Thirty years at the American Center for law and justice were dedicated to protecting your religious and constitutional freedom because of the many ac ... members who stand with us we've seen great success over the years as we engage in legal legislative\nAnd cultural issues that matter most to you and your family\nA seal Jay is on the front line when it comes to protecting your freedom defending Christians and their faith in this country and abroad standing up for human life battling abortion\nWorking to cut off taxpayer funding Planned Parenthood there's not a better time for you to join the American Center for law and justice standing with us you can make a tremendous difference in our country has our culture", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "08"}
