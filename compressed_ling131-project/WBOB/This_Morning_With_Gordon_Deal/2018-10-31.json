[noise]\nHow ridiculous it were the only country in the world where a person comes and has it baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas ... and it has to end\nThe president correct there we are one of just a couple of the ...\nFirst world countries if you will still allows\nA this is a birthright citizenship for those who come to the country illegally there's a lot of different ways to look at this one are you talking about those who are who are lawful permanent residents Supreme Court ruled way back in the Eighteen hundreds that if you are pair if your parents are lawful permanent residents that you are a birthright citizenship so\nThat is an issue that's been settled for a long time by the U.S Supreme Court but you don't have to speculate on the bt behind the constitution the question is really if you are the child of a documented or illegal immigrants in the United states do you did gain access to US citizenship\nBecause of the key part of the fourteenth amendment\nWhich reads all persons born or naturalized the United states\nAnd subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states the question is more of those parents are they subject to the jurisdiction there up now they are subject to be deported\nBut are they subject to the positives that come\nFrom being a lawful permanent resident or a U.S citizen the protections that come from being a U.S citizen certainly you or not if you are here illegally uh and so the question is can you do it by executive order as the president ... uh uh\nAt first the thought was it had to be done through constitutional ... but then it was he said you know certainly through legislation but\nPotentially through executive order as well we're going to break all this down for you today we've gone through the legal issues here\nBecause again I think one week after the midterms the caravan issue also still are right front and center a politics front and center and the president makes this statement about executive order as attorneys or we can address this for you and kind of explained the ins and outs of again what\nIs a new way of looking at this specific issue I think you have to get to boil it down to what are the specific issues that will get it through those who are bored to punt documented or what we call illegal immigrants\nAre they subject to the grant a birthright citizenship there's been interpreted the fourteenth the ... what do you believe give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty what did you believe the president should do this do executive order and fight this legal battle it will certainly be a legal battle in the courts no doubt about that\nGive us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one kid birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants children\nThree one zero it wasn't until the Nineteen sixties and told even starting to be applied this way very interesting which\nIs a critical time for our nation and for the world with so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for law and justice has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state massive corruption in

J. dot org [noise] there's not a better time to stand with the ACL James become a member and make a difference as we work to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the the OJ on law sign up right now ... ...\nIt's a historic move now the United states is December seem Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf the state of Israel and is very right to exist leaves a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies abound\nISIS come on Hezbollah and Iran all pledged in white plains Rio from the very severe in his new book your times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem\nMiddle school and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear ... to\nRemove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal ... reported by Israel's enemy\nGet your copy today Jerusalem of biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\n[noise] we're one week\nOut from the mid term elections and the president it just a piece of\nAn interview there'll be airy uh later on HBO\n... the idea of birthright citizenship he's asked a question about\n... through executive order when it comes to a those board or from illegal immigrants so we got a question companies Christine on Facebook\nSure George what does it ever sweet illegal immigrants and undocumented immigrants\nIt is a matter of choice of words the left typically likes to use the word undocumented immigrants it's seen as more PC uh because uh again I documented the truth is what does that document it'd be a major illegally here so there's no difference I just try to use both terms because people\nAre sometimes hear one antique well maybe the other doesn't apply\nIt applies to both because they are they are in effect the same thing that take a listen to President Trump he he was asked have you spoken with\nAs you plan on on on this executive order\n'em and again there's different ways to write this\nOn on this executive order a and again there's different ways to write this executive order I mean we're just getting very ... general statements for President Trump has he consulted council tickle us by to\nTalk about with household young\nTo wear in the process in the process it'll happen\nSo I mean they say it's in the process it'll happen I I Believe the focus will be\nA primarily on those who have no legal right to be in the United states so call it a document called the illegal who didn't have children\nAnd I just to give you kind of sub statistics about that uh this has picked but uh just back in I think it was there's been three hundred and Seventy thousand of these children according to a ... sixteen a study\nOr so the numbers are kind of all over the place depending on how you define the term in twenty fourteen there were about two hundred and Seventy five thousand babies two hundred Seventy five thousand babies were born to authorize immigrant parents so illegal immigrant parents that's about seven percent of the four billion birds that year\nUS citizenship of course is a grant of of a ... that's a very important\nThe difference between getting birthright citizenship it'd be naturalized actually has long applications for what kind of office you can hold\nIn the United states can you be president of the United states but also the rights of responsibilities that come with it or all a big from one part of the constitution it is the fourteenth amendment which reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today it's easy to do is go online and sign up ... [noise]\nAsked about the idea of an executive order ending birthright citizenship for those who were bored or the parents were illegal immigrants or a documented immigrants use whatever turbulent like or that they should not be automatic us citizens we're not talking about those who have lawful permanent residents record is already decided on that\nWe're not talking about even people who may have green cards or to be here to work here on a temporary basis I think we're talking about those here legally potentially those who kind of this idea of\nBaby tourism or birth tourism where you're you're using a tourist visa or to play around with you will have your birth and the Obama administration even crack down on that by the way and the companies that were raging that I think it's very important to note there's been a crackdown on this\n... the previous administration as well the big question is could it be done through executive order even in this limited sets of those who are here illegally it all goes to a tournament the constitution\nThe fourteenth amendment which is that all persons born or naturalized the United states and here's the key ads subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states\nWhat does it mean to be subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre you as an illegal immigrant\nSubject to be positive jurisdiction of the United states I eat the protections of the United states just so do you define how do you define\nA big subject to the jurisdiction will be key it how far the president can go\nBy executive order how far the legislative branch should go\nAnd the deed to even a potential uh you know constitutional limits\nAs well of course all this would likely be decided by the U.S Supreme Court is well this is going to be something that would be fought if it when as the president said he will issue this executive order or let's go right to the phones one eight hundred sixty four thirty what did actually before we do\nI gave the radio the Facebook at periscope audits an update on this for those you can listen to radio and don't get us during the breaks but we keep talking there is a news reports out our ... we have an officer Pakistan\nWorking on the sea it'd be the case that mother five who's been in prison\nOr for eight years on death row or as her cases at the final appeal to you at the Supreme Court in Pakistan\nA verdict has been reached\nAnd it is being reported that verdict will be announced whether she will live or die\nOr sometime this evening us time so it was the late evening the United States I've instructed our team here who works with directly with our Pakistan office to keep our social media team updated so that if this verdict is released\nThis the the that we get that news out to you about see a baby's fate as quickly as possible now I always would say within ... this is the Pakistan Supreme Court\nThere have been a lot of ups and downs things that get reported say that our company that don't end up actually a happy that day but this is what is being reported it would be monumental it very bored so we are tracking that very closely pray for\nIt would be monumental in very poor and so we are tracking that very closely pray for\nA C a bb pray for her family prefer the judge has basically this decision and pray for the right outcome which has her free to release from prison and a at a release from uh this deficit it's which never been a post on her we will keep you updated on that case coming out of Pakistan let's go back to the post\nWas written take people who are in support people who oppose and again we're taking yourself a brief\nMention a discussion of this by President Trump\nIt with a news organization very limited how was discussing it to illegal immigrants who are here who didn't have a child or is that child a U.S citizen right now we're allowing that to become a a those children to become us citizens by birth\nThe chain it's happened really always says the Nineteen sixties that that has been accepted issues could that be changed by executive order Rosie calling from California has opposing view rosy welcome to Jason you'll live you're on the air\nThank you for your call our ... our President Trump who he is not very clear or what he was born here my parents were legal are so many wonderful I Pretend that got the courage care every\nNight for burgers where in the military Iraq or Afghanistan you know and he starts he took a burger with that because we weren't in this country and ... ... ...\n... you know Rosie here here's one here's how I Would say is that\nThis has nothing to do with those who took advantage of this pre or a change it shows that retroactive to affect your family I think that there's been a change significantly from the time of year parents came here\nUm and and your brother's if you were born here to today where we have a whole industry around this there's an industry around birth tourism there's industry around getting over the border illegally to have your children here for that purpose of getting to US citizenship when\nYou don't have citizenship yourself and there has been a change around the world so I don't take anything away rosy from your family's experience your brother's loss proudly serving his country and it is his country that he served it bought died for it is your country Rosie to be proud of\nBoth the prejudice talking about is moving forward is this the right policy for America and other countries in the western\nWorld have said no absolutely so the United states perhaps along with Canada\nUm ... is the only remaining country in the developed world that authorizes birthright citizenship it's important also to note or that there has been a sky rocketing number of\nChildren born to illegal so in twenty sixteen the number approach four hundred thousand a that is an absolutely huge number and so policies have consequences and so we should seek to deter birth tourism\nAnd this is a proposal would as you correctly point out Jordan not affect those individuals who are already here the focal point\nHe's on ending the practice going forward yeah uh and so I think there is perhaps some unwarranted\nFears that have come up with respect to individuals who are already here the president has also proposed a\n... ... legalizing sound the illegals or over time or in the ... with the cooperation of Congress or what we're talking about is a proposal\nUh that would look at new births are and in this practice and I think at least\nBased on my legal research it's clear beyond question that the United States Supreme court has offered to various opinions on that particular question going back to Eighteen eighty four\nI think this is what we can answer very quickly Larry and Indiana has this or a question for slavery welcome to Jay suck you alive you're on the air\nThank you I'm On the on the support of a changing correct in the immigration laws a summons for the ... but I Believe it would have either have to be down through through a legislation and land or a a man that process for this reason these are you [noise]\nYou know for for many years of it the the uh the people that were born babies that were born even out possessions they add states ... ... ... ... work instead of\nSays to fight in the U.S code right\n[noise] right second um [noise] it's so if someone comes in a scenario for male male illegal alien comes to the United states across the border and then does not marry but has children by a U.S citizen\nOf the ... the child is a U.S citizen one parent is enough\nAnd that is to find also even if you were born abroad are there some time issues there but if it happened in the United states and the parents is a U.S citizen or one of the parents that that child as a U.S citizen that is not an issue here on on what President Trump is talking about through this executive order we write back on Jay ...\nIs a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important than right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the the L ... daughter\nFrom all over the world just to have their child in American food and also for people and I'm In Texas the people who are just slowly coming across the border\nUm to have their child here so that they can become a citizen and you know that [noise] you know the concern of mine and I actually work with a guy from South Africa here legally get you get to the whole process friend this is science talked about\nThat he thinks the now we talk a lot about the different issues like immigration and he thinks that the you know he suggested this long before President Trump did that\nIn our country or maybe I think that Canada\nYou know I Can't go to England and have a child and he says you know what I\nKnow you could not I mean it and in fact what it would be that if you if you hit US law\nIf you were there and you're a U.S citizen or just you are if you if your husband or partner is also a U.S citizen but it could just be you\nUm does your child is American and that nothing changes better way under what the president's talking about here ... executive action one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ton I Want to keep taking calls this a lot of questions a lot of comments can be good\nAnd and a lot of good info to get out there about this I think it's important discussion Janice calling from Virginia Beach Virginia on line five jade welcome to Jay you'll live\nHey how are you were good\n\nYou're on the air Jim Sallis them I thought there might\nQuestions or comments are about the um\nThe undocumented illegal to come in and how their children and um their children become residents and and they have no way to pay so I I Am ... living on earth and I work in a hospital and they\nCome in that are on social services is set forth get in touch with the families and help try to get the Medicaid or something to help pay for their hospital bills and so forth\nAnd their children from my understanding was you had Medicaid I'm your children now are covered under the Medicaid and until I think they're twelve years old or older\nSo there's a financial burden on citizens as well on ... and my thought is why are we not looking at that and taking care of our our citizens are elderly and are under privileged and are you know people that are poverty and helping them with is worse than the illegal to\n'em are coming up here just for that service and there's no other country did it go and get that\nYou're talking about the Sears the were then once they're bored and under the current interpretation of the law\nAnnounce things operate universe you they're getting all these rights the rights to\nMedicaid which then flows to the child which is how the birth is covered financially at the hospital for parents who are they're legally and read it brings a whole host of the issues and problems and it's sometimes it can be ... we don't want to have these difficulties ...\nBut I think you're being very brave Jan as a delivery nurse I Know you care about those kids that are being delivered there do you wish to do harm is the idea is that you see it so often the financial issues that so many people are facing\nAnd that we are not focusing on those who are already inside the country so I really appreciate that called you because you're you're seeing it from all these different sides here we have another person by the way he's calling ...\nWho has immigrated here gone through the process let's take a look let's go to that let's take a listen to what they have to say Robin Utah like three welcome to Jason alive [noise]\nHey thanks for taking my call Hey Rob [noise]\nYeah I uh I immigrated in the eighties came through as a student I got married a long story short got my citizenship did it the legal way had to have financial sponsors so that I could\nTake care of myself and my situation was I had a some minor children from a pass marriage in Australia that\nDuring the period of time live with me off and on and I went to school here in the United states as an adult one of us children wanted\nTo come live with me and I thought automatically he was\nYou know in the system or he was here for a period of time then went back to Australia came back through LAX was detained at the airport and refused admission because they said he overstayed his visit by a few months just weeks ago\nUm and um he refused to be deported he was put in jail you remain there for ten months some at some point a back and forth on suicide watch was distressing tired or him [noise]\nAh anyway they told me that they weren't going to let him in the country he had never committed any crimes a long story short um\nMy library applied for his citizenship status that was granted while he was a study that there's a six year waiting lists of Australians are in the end they weren't going to let him out of jail\nIt was ten months in jail I said so I'm going on wait in line I Know you have to wait six years now before you can get your citizenship or return to the United states but\nWait in line do the do it the right way and I'm I'm totally offended that people think that they can come to this country the break all the laws circumvent the system and bump people like my son who I Believe has good standing to be here\nAre here legally his father's here legally I Know there's issues there are a big races shoes I Would have if you will be consulted attorney they would have told you Rob that because he was an adult and on a minor there were some issues there but he went through our written this process\nAnd his father is illegal US citizen and you will to really said after that who were this process I'm just going through the system he got granted the citizenship got put on the list this is how long it will take you before you could come and start that process but you can\nAnd that's what I keep pointing out I mean just wanted to go to both here was here\nIt is very difficult for those who want to come here legally already and they go through a lot to to get US citizenship is important to them their US citizenship we as as Americans who did not go through that process sometimes take for granted they don't and what do you hear those kinds of stories even stories of\nDifficult immigration detention to tell you said they'll go back and do what the right way we got your granted\nBritish detention didn't tell you said they'll go back and do what the right way we got you granted citizenship ultimately in years to come\nThese the kinds of stories that should be focused on a because these ... these are very important they should be just as the ... workers as well instead of just the illegal immigrants crossing over to bypass people are like his his son\nYeah we are a compassionate country I'm a compassionate person I understand if I Lived in one country and I was poor and I looked across the river and I knew that I could go there and better my life I Would want to come\nBut you can be compassionate and yet we must have compassion for people like the caller and his son as well and there has to be order there has to be structure that does not antithetical to compassion I we need to fix our immigration system is broken Congress has done nothing to fix it\nThe compassionate thing to do is to fix immigration\nWho would we come back from this break\nWe'll take all your questions that's what we do with the final say with a broadcast we just go right through the costs who's been holding the longest we start there we work our way down this phone lines for right now but if you
