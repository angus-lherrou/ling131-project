Honduras pass through Guatemala before entering Mexico on its way the United states\nAnd I'm going to go to professor hundreds him from a policy standpoint so let's talk for a moment here about what that policy should be well\nThe first point is that we should just ban not only our borders but we should defend the rule of law\nSo the court to central question becomes will Mexico do anything to stop the caravan that's number one and number two we'll Democrats continue to dodge this assault\nOn America's borders and the rule of law\nAnd so those are the two questions that are outstanding I think in this vacuum if you will in terms of leadership from Mexico and the Democrats are the burden falls on the Trump Administration to enforce the rule of law\nAnd I have confidence that they will do it\nBut you know you also want to avoid a some you know any kind of armed conflict here I mean this is a that would be a disaster I Would not be the right way to do that so we gotta figure will do this after the break\nBut we'll take your calls at winning hundred sixty four thirty one ten let me go to a quickly here really quick to west Smith colonel specific what's what's your initial reaction to this\nYeah well what is happening Jay we're witnessing is the lack of unaffected domestic policy that these are the immigration reform is creating a true national security issue because of the lack of reform and lack of border security and it does have serious implications\nNo question about it All right we're going to take your calls one eight hundred sixty four three one zero to national security\nEmergency on our borders a caravan of people on their way to the United states no pop possible way to process that amount of people is going to be a rush to the border we don't know we'll take your calls at eight hundred sixty four thirty one time\n[noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation and for the world with so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for law and justice has never been more important than right now\nAt the AC OJ were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state massive corruption in Washington [noise] battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nFrom commitment to constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists\nAnd you can learn more about the mission and work can be ... on line and hasty L.

J. thought\nIt's a historic move now the United states has moved to Tennessee and Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf Israel and it's very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies abound\nISIS come off as the law in Iran all pledged white Israel from the very severe in his new book York Times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem\nMiddle school and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear irrefutable evidence to\nRemove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal miss purported by Israel's and\nHere's your copy today in Jerusalem of biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon\n\nSome ... some call it an attempt an invasion let me tell you what the president said\nWe want people\nTo come into our three point seven percent unemployment soloist is more than fifty\n[noise]\nSo that's what the president said he's declared it's basically a a national emergency but there's an interesting issue here I Want to point this out uh we had an interesting a comic come in on Facebook\nOr that I wanted to have met a west address because he made his point already and then as soon as you know Facebook said how can the Mets and authorities deal with the caravan of besides and as soon as a go ahead what's got him when you said it's really important\nWell they sent down five hundred Mexican federal police to try and stop them at the southern border of Mexico and they were incapable of doing that was going to happen if this crowd of people thousands of people are allowed to come to our border as our own border patrol is overwhelmed and they will be\nThe drug cartels in human traffickers who use are porous border on a daily basis\nDrug cartels and human traffickers who use are porous border on a daily basis\nThey will take advantage of this distraction with our border patrol being ... you know overpowered in distracted and they will use other crossings\nTo continue their drug trade and to continue the human trafficking that goes on there so they will take full advantage of our own border patrol being overwhelmed there's no way the president border agents we have can handle a crowd of this size\nSo Harry let me ask you this let's get we're going to take some calls him over here but let's talk about a policy standpoint what do you do if the president United States and the governors of these states on the border if there is they rushed to the border well for may well be\nFirst whatever the administration does and whatever those are state governors do must be done in a carefully calibrated and morally defensible manner\nAt the same time be older all objective ought to be to defend our borders it's important to note that defending America's borders used to be a bi partisan activity\nOf America's borders were strongly defended in the past by President Obama vice a secretary of State Hillary Clinton but today it seems like there is only one party that is interested in protecting the American people\nFrom an invasion of individuals\nWhich includes drug smuggling and human smuggling and human\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL Jay member today it's easy to do is go online and sign up the OJ dawn\n[noise]\nEverybody was America's broadcasts taking your calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten or in the studio with me now is Stuart Rob senior counsel for the ACL Jay we've got west and also Harry in our media center a I gave a report on where we were they are about twenty two hundred miles from the U.S a California\nKind of San Diego Tijuana border and about eleven hundred miles from the\nSouthern Mexico right now from the nearest us border crossing in Texas but Stuart this does raise I mean ... I talked about what what's at stake here this is a big deal well\nWe're not talking about it she was mean we're not talking about immigration we're talking about people coming into the country illegally\nNow is part of this caravan we know there's a human condition listen there are a lot of people in these countries or that they can't support themselves there's no jobs there's no food there's no medical care there's no education now these governments bear the responsibility for that\nBut in in this group of people that are are coming into these countries illegally we have criminals we have we have drug dealers we have all sorts of individuals that\nDon't need to be part of what's going on here in the United states and therefore there is a system that's set up it does what does he just can't handle fourteen thousand eighty eight cannot handle fourteen thousand people it's not set up for that and these governments on on the south of us they need to control\nTheir borders it when people are not thinking about it I Hope they are is that we have look I I'm an papers you know for for comprehensive immigration for my goodness on the second generation and my family board in the United states but having said that I\nYou got to have an orderly approach to it or let me tell you is being penalize all the people that are lawfully waiting in line up for immigration status and to the United states I mean let's not ignore them either and I don't want to see a disaster on the border which I'm afraid is what we're uh\nWe're looking at here but I mean this is the reality of what we have All right let's go back to the phones one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten Rosie is calling from Los Angeles\nOn line five\n... thank you for taking my call for my parents were actually immigrant parents can call\n... ... ... all things me out of the day and we made our parents legal but one thing that a lot of people do not understand ... than there is a hard subject and\nPeople don't understand a lot of the people that have been deported were criminals gang members that were terrorizing our string and what kind of all of those people are going to take care of it and are going to come I Know that number that they say it's a low number\nBecause they look at the met at the Mexican news outlets that are a lot of people that are going to try to come out and\nWell and the Mexican by the way they're just a drop in per second I'll let you finish Rosie the Mexican media is reporting that number's closer to fourteen thousand\nYou there yeah yeah okay\nSo I mean it's no you're right it's a it's a big number this is what the president had to say let's play the number for\nIs an assault on our cuts [noise]\nMan you have some very bad\nVery bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country that is and I was just talk\n[noise] and we can't let that happen to our country at us and I was just all get you a great governor and senator that you were talking about your attorney general or going to be introducing in a second but I'm Talking to a lot of people\nAnd they're going to form a all different kind of all until we get the other one will\nIt mean you know Harry let's talk about this from a policy standpoint what is the reality of what the what can be done here I mean you can't just have\nFourteen thousand people pour over because you can just it's a disaster I mean let's becomes a ... a a country of know of no laws are rules I don't know what groups and the political left are saying but this does not help the debate for immigration reform\nYou're absolutely correct and most of the voices on the left have been utterly silent\nBut it's also important to remember that earlier this year another a caravan commenced and only a twenty percent of those individuals reached the American border or in California\nAnd so if we find a similar percentage with respect to the fourteen thousand it's possible\nUh and I don't know this for a fact but it's possible that the number or might be diminished down to two to three thousand that's still a large number\nA but that number would indeed be more manageable\nBut if we go back to the policy debate or the policy debate at least at this particular point in time has become one sided as I mentioned earlier it used to be that there was a bipartisan consensus\nOn immigration and protecting our borders that bipartisan consensus as utterly disappears\nAnd so it's very very important to think about that in terms of what's going to happen over the next day or two to three weeks or in terms of the mid term elections\nOr in terms of what do the American people believe should be done going forward and so that they need to be brought into this conversation or a as well\nSo well I think the American people need to be educated that\nWe have systems and we have systems for reason if they saw the forms that individuals have to sell out to come to this country that understand\nThe country is protecting them they're protecting them from people that come into this country\nThat may have criminal records they're protecting Americans from people that come into this country that have no means to support themselves so there's a system for a reason it's been it's been a place for an awful long time you know we're concerned about the merits humanitarian issues and all these countries and we have a lot of compassion\nTowards those individual however there still is a system that needs to be respected we nobody has a right Jay to just of course not come into America and just set up camp you shouldn't have that right in any country a country is defined by its borders\nA country that's also defined by the rule of law which has has violated candies calling from Las Vegas Nevada Hi candy on the air\nYes Hi Jay thank you for taking my call 'em you know a few issues going on here I've been watching this for the last year actually and um\nThere's a lot of and I know they're coming in from California side in Texas side there's a lot of ranchers ... I'm going to say\nIt may sound inhumane to some people but that's my my theory at all my theory on this is so that nobody gets shot or\nKilled heaven forbid there's a lot of ranchers in California and there's a lot of ranchers in Texas why can't\nWe have a few days before they ... they reach these destinations why can't\nWe ... and I I don't know if you know anything about the cattle partying or anything like that\nNow we're not going to look at ... we're not going to do that I mean we're because we're the United states of America so we don't do that\nI mean that's not the way you handle this we have got to utilize see what people are ignoring here is the diplomatic efforts that need to be going on I'm sure are going on right now I was just that the state department on a pastor Brunson matter but I could assure you I mean I did not discuss with anybody but you know there are diplomatic efforts going on right now with our our\nPartners whether it's in in in Mexico with their counterparts at the state department\nThis is a national emergency but we don't round people we got to protect the border and I I I Wish I could give you the answer on what to do I'm we're not doing I mean I I completely think that the the last call was this was was that was going on and I think the ... the reality is what we need to have happened here\nIs we've got a look at this is going to impact world opinion on the United states you let's not be naive let's be smart [noise]\nOkay let's be smart it's an it's a seven to fourteen thousand person problem that significant which they are still thousands of miles away from the United states we need to be working with our governments in the region [noise]\nTo get control of this before we have a confrontation with Mexico Mexican authorities over this because we did you sign a trade deal with them so there's a lot of things that can take place you're All right we're for another thirty minutes and we don't get the full hour the broadcast just go over to a C. O. J. dot org you can also\nOf course was on Facebook and prayers go back with more than ...\nIs a critical time for nation and for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country in the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional on religious freedom\nYou're going to become a member of the AC OJ lawn lawn sign up right now we see ... daughter\nWant the border to become a slaughterhouse we want that to be anticipated before if the Mexican government would agree for American troops or American border agents have patrol agents to go into Mexican territory first and to stop the a caravan of what do you want to call it a caravan\nThe horde the mob from reaching the border\nIn an orderly fashion providing them\nWith the shelter with the food the closings eve a martyr and other supplies that they need while they're still in Mexico then that would avoid and I've heard a potentially very bloody clash at the United states border that should be avoided at all costs\nSo you you asked this question when you look at the numbers of people that are going a and the estimates right now are around Seventy two hundred that's the domestic estimates there\nAre reports from a media sources of Mexico saying it may be more like fourteen thousand\nBut the problem here is you've got Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador have allowed this to happen now Mexico's rushed in the middle of it when we just\nWorked out a trade arrangement with them so relations are good so I think the intervention has to take place before the border incident you want to avoid a border incidents of intervention Harry has to take place earlier and that's where the diplomatic channels come in and you're working with the Mexican government\nI think that's absolutely correct so first I think we should look at the long term incentives that we create if we open the border to mass um vetted of\nMigration or by individuals from Central America\nThat clearly has consequences negative consequences for the United states\nAnd it could propel additional caravans in the future that's number one number two at the same time we should be prepared to incentivize the Honduran El Salvador in Mexican Guatemalan governments\nAnd we should send a clear an unmistakable message to them that if they fail to take action to stem the flow\nOf migrants a bet bearer will indeed be consequences so what we need is something that is sadly missing at this particular point in time and that is international cooperation and collaboration on this issue\nIt's clear beyond question that many of the migrants are they are in dire circumstances they are indeed need help\nWe are prepared to help but we're prepared to help those individuals in the countries where they currently reside or where they are currently traveling\nUm but if those countries failed to work with us there should indeed be long term consequences with respect to America's relationship with those countries\nWhile the president I mean it said as much I mean that you know this idea that we are given out all the said and it's not going to the people and you will result in something like this but I I'm going to go back to this kind of my team for the rest of this broadcast and that is Wes I think the intervention has to take place here before before you have the border in a confrontation\nYeah absolutely you want to keep us troops safe while they're also you know bringing some semblance of security to the border\nThe best way to do that is to get them off of the border if you have to use the military and quite frankly jade there are not a enough pleaser border patrol agents to handle this crowd we're going to have to be creative in our thinking and I think the president thinking about using the military is thinking outside the box and that's good\nBut I Would not put military people on the border war through diplomatic channels with Mexico\nAre allowed us to go in to help them not only with crowd control but with humanitarian assistance or military they're good at that they do it all the time keep the crisis away from the border is the only way to diffuse is in my opinion\nA John on Facebook wrote this isn't an easy issue it's complicated thank you for being nuanced\nAnd starting the conversation and how to handle this difficult situation I think you do have to be new ones but I I I'm going back to our the NBA seal Jay's position is to try to avoid a border confrontation there's no way in in a border confrontation no there were any body for the for the people trying to seek refuge north for the United states\nBorder confrontation means potential slaughter and I mean that\nI'm not being over I'm not saying this hyperbolic Lee are being are exaggerating about it but a border confrontation between a crowd of seven thousand to fourteen thousand people and on the United states troops means that a spark a Kendall a spark of something could go on that would result in a slaughter that would be horrendous\nFor all people concerned including America including the migrants including a everybody that that that is involved in this and it was and it it would be a sad and terrible commentary and episode in American history if that were permitted to occur\nHere's what the vice president Mike Pence number Fifteen\nThis this is a is unconscionable for us to continue to allow this to occur but the way we can and it has the president's made clear is to have a Congress that is willing to not only fund a wall um secure our border\nBut to close the loop holes of the human traffickers and filing gang members use to entice people to make them along and dangerous journey up the peninsula\n[noise] well I don't know if we're on or not we lost a we've apparently lost audio on our and I'm I'm assuming that we had Mike\nPence was conversation there but what I I think that's clear what Mike is saying is about the border security in a border wall I think that's great but the reality is that there's that that is not going to happen today Andy no\nIt's not it's not going to happen today it's going to be something that is a long term consequences in something that we definitely have to address because I think that\nAs I said before we do not want a confrontation and I think\nThey were too says he'll do his position is that we have\nThe intervention before it reaches the border before it reaches crisis proportions in prizes dimensions and that's what that would ... and I think the president has said we I don't know the the last time that it can be said that we have faced a national emergency of this caliber of this\nThe last time that it can be said that we have faced a national emergency of this caliber of this quality or a low quality terrible quality uh\nYou know the invasions and I keep going back to historical precedent when we talk about invasions that have occurred uh in history no invasion that isn't and Curt in history that has been unmitigated that has had no control has ever had good consequences\nHarry what's in your view what is the the the first and best thing that can be done right now\nWill first we should be negotiating and I'm sure that we are with those countries that we've talked about previously I think ... absolutely correct we do not want to see the border situation become a crisis\nBecause if it becomes a crisis than it is a no win situation for the United states and it's a no win situation for the migrants so we should use every arrow in our quiver to make sure that we stem\nThe flow before it reaches our border that should be our number one objective\nLonger term we need to reform immigration laws and we also need to recalibrate our relationship with Central American countries based on their response to America's interest [noise]\nWell these are exactly I mean I think these are great points I I'm going to go back to what I said at the at the outset it's kind of the position that were advocating hairs there needs to be an intervention before we have a border confrontation\nSo whether that's the diplomatic channels or whatever is done to help the Mexican authorities get control of the situation we need to avoid a border confrontation that's not good for the United states not good for the migrants not good for the people seeking asylum back\nMore than a historic move\nNow the United states is December the in
