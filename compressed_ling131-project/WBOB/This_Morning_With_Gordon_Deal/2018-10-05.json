[noise]\n\nThis is a secular today out as a secular line releases its report to the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh\nWashington DC\nInformation that was asked in requested by senator additional information has now been provided and chairman Grassley said in a statement earlier this morning now that they have that information it's time for this and it's time for them to confirm judges have enough\nPhone lines are open for your questions right now call one eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero\nHe believes is Brett Kavanaugh will because I Know when to hold\nFor three one zero\nHe believes is Kevin ... because I Know what you hope you hope he doesn't do you believe he well\nI think that's all very very close out\nHangs by a few undecided Democrats than Republicans I haven't read it before it yet [noise] um if I were to just get today have only narrowly confer and now your\nHost Jordan secular\nTo Second Life this is Jordan secular we are taking\nYour phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten\nIf you have not yet heard\nThe city has begun to review the FBI supplemental report on Brett Kavanaugh was requested last week the White House authorized that after Jeff Flake basically said I Will not\nVote yes on Brett Kavanaugh there may be other Republican senators who wrote unless this report is Doug that report has been released to the U.S Senate the White House who receive the report first because the FBI is the executive branch agency\nHas already come out and said this is the best case scenario for Brett Kavanaugh because as we said the FBI would I come out to Dr Ford is a liar\nBut what we've heard is that there was no other information to corroborate eighty of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh that is the best case scenario for Brett Kavanaugh cloture motion has been filed that happened last night after we're on the air or we will explain to what that means\nBut I think this is a very telling remark it just happened moments ago from Senator Dianne Feinstein take a listen\nWhat I can say is it the most notable hard at this report is let's not ten it\nYou know what's not in it any any any corroborated allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and they they get their their set I Will not put anything past we said this was really face to\nAlready yesterday the tweets were coming out the phase three attack that Brett Kavanaugh was a didn't matter what was in the report he doesn't have the right temperament I mean you could literally see the tweets coming out from Democrat senators they were there so they've still got that line of attack\nThat they are pushing it right capital but the FBI report has come out there are viewing it and that sort of right now it is not public but all indications are from everybody seen it from both sides of the aisle is it was very surreal report that was the worst from a very important sitters Susan Collins of Maine who has been a a toss up on this vote\nAnd that there is no new information they're nothing to operate any of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh this is as close as it could get to Brett Kavanaugh for being cleared 'cause the FBI was going to come back\nAnd make it includes in that Dr Ford was lie or that these other allegations were lies they they will just put out say you know they don't have any of their other information\nOut to corroborate or these stories and so it's kind of like where we were last week take it's a word for word but it's it's a step further because now you really have tried to find other people to corroborate this from an outside the U. S. citizen in the FBI law enforcement world and they have not been able to do so so thin\nCloture has been filed explain to people what's going to happen the next twenty four thirty six hours\nYeah it was filed last night on the floor of the Senate Jordan basically that means that at any point tomorrow they could take a cloture vote though which would be a vote to end debate on the floor of the Senate now leader McConnell has said he is going to take that vote no later than one o'clock in the afternoon eastern time tomorrow it could be before that and in fact\nI think there's a high likelihood they'll reach an agreement to take the earlier in the morning because Jordan and\nWhat it sets off the closures approved it means there'll be thirty hours of posts cloture debate before a final vote I think they'll probably agree to take that boat earlier in the day tomorrow because they are going to want to get out of town on Saturday but look these votes are common there's gonna be a cloture vote tomorrow at around ... tomorrow and then a final vote on Saturday\nSo we think about that folks we are heading very quickly towards the confirmation vote a\nPond Brett Kavanaugh they're still toss ups they're still Republican toss ups will talk about that\nWe will answer your questions get your comments what do you think about this\nFBI report comes out to get it to corroborate any stories that's not enough for Democrats of course let's get your comments give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth that one eight hundred six eight for three one zero [noise]\nThey're upset because of what's not and what's not it is information that would have put this nomination cause it to go down one eight hundred sixty four thirty one said [noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work at the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the AC OJ were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family [noise]\nDefending human like standing up for a good friend Israel\nWorking to uncover the deep state massive corruption in Washington battling to end the genocide of Christians in many parts of the world\nAnd the firm commitment to constitutional efforts to protect our country from radical Islamic terrorists\nYou can learn more about the mission and work can be ... online an ACL jade auto [noise] there's not a better time to stand with the AC OJ become a member and make a difference as we work to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now\nThe the L G thought\nIt's a historic move now the United states is December seem Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is Israel's true capital\nOf the state of Israel and it's very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS Hamas Hezbollah and Iran all pledged in white plains Rio from the very severe in his new book New York times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem mikel and historical case for the Jewish capital\nPresents clear your repeatable evidence to remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal ... reported by Israel's in I mean\nHere's your copy today in Jerusalem of biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now Amazon were born to know [noise]\n\nOkay so the FBI report has been delivered from the FBI to the White House\nTo the U.S Senate senators are reviewing it right now some already have the word out\nA from both sides is that there is no information to operate any of the allegations against spread capital what does that mean\nLet me as as of now as of everyone they distributed so far the public has not been able to we have not been able to review that yet I'm this information has at least it's being kept a very close to the best uh by the U.S it\nIs that this will now interface three of the attack on Brett Kavanaugh it said do all this doesn't matter\nWe don't like his temperament we don't like the fact that he was tough on us because we made allegations that we now know could not be corroborated by our nation's top law enforcement agency the FBI and a ... and uh and they didn't like how Brett Kavanaugh acted when he was being accused of that\nBy those Democratic senators who made this extremely partisan process\nBeverly on Facebook writes this though now the cloture vote that motion\n... Facebook writes this though neither cloture vote that motion has been a a filed\nThat should happen tomorrow the confirmation votes should happen on Saturday the Beverly and Facebook Rice's we're getting the phone calls ready to go what can the Democrats do now to obstruct or has their game run out there and I think there there are games close but I stayed very guarded at the vigil it if you worry Brett Kavanaugh supporter\nBecause I'm though Susan Collins has made what could be interpreted as positive comments after reviewing a the reports say it seems to be very thorough I'm incomplete that's the opposite of what Democrats what a ... are saying so she's not calling for more investigations I'm Jeff Flake same that there's nothing there\nBut but this war is not yet over we talked about the phase three which is already happening this was still face to the the sexual allegations face three is temperament and they're still focusing on that and I think that we'll see that shift happened in the next few hours\nYeah and and look the the the Senate Democrats aren't going to be convinced on this door and so they're not going to stop the targeting and they know they know just as well as as as you and I do that the three Republican senators that they need to convince they need to get an answer to the three there Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nOr Jeff Flake and Jordan I don't think it's going to stop all the way through Saturday and here's why I think they will make an argument to those three senators that even if you vote for cloture tomorrow you think there's enough information out there you think there's FBI investigation was Thoreau that's reason enough to stop debate\nBut we want to convince you that this is not the right nominee for the court and and I think they will still continue making those arguments to those three senators all the way up until Saturday but Jordan\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today and it's easy to do is go on line sign up ... daughter\n[noise] book back\nAnd Jason you'll live this is Jordan secular we are taking your phone calls one eight hundred sixty four thirty wanted to talk to us on the other one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to in\nOrder to play this or that from Chris Coons Chris who went on a Fox for this morning he was asked about uh the vote that Chris ... is a Democrat\nWard who I think as you could say is responsible for getting just like to some extent to pull that start to say that there's got to be a supplemental investigation\nIt was ... let me remind you Jeff Flake who put the limits as he said he just needs to be a week and I just used to cover these topics and\nA half so I Will vote yes to move this nomination for what you do just shared committee has devoted a committed to voting anyway on cloture or on the actual confirmation of vote but here it's a big tally from Chris ...\nThe I ... it was it a slip a does this change is just to fire up the base you'd be the judge we can discuss it to take a listen by eleven\nAnd believe this cabinet will because I Know what you hope you hope he does that do you believe he will [noise]\nI think that's all very very close\nBy a few undecided Democrats and Republicans\nHaven't read this report yet [noise] um if I were to just get today he will be narrowly confer\nSo interesting about that Chris ... who is all the ... committee fan has said that he believes Brett Kavanaugh will be there narrowly confirmed that that may be because he is good friends with Jeff Flake\nAnd he does it maybe he does not want to join what could be somewhat embarrassing battle against Brett Kavanaugh we will see what other comments he has to make certainly he's a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh but uh but you know are we starting to see than\nSome break the Democrats I again I put ... take nothing for granted until these votes occur until Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed but are we starting to see a breakout or maybe that was a slip\nTo even admit that he believes that Brett Kavanaugh would kick in for maybe try to get off well dot stopped talking about it\nYeah that that certainly could be but whether it was a break or a slip Jordan I think it is the best indication we have had to date of where Jeff Flake stands on this boat I mean again you you said it but does senator ... very good friends they were the two ... two U.S senators instrumental in the agreement for this one way to lay and if you combine it with what Jeff Flake said\nThat if he saw a new additional cooperating information inside this report he would be a yes vote\nWell senator coon just seeing the reports Senator Flake of seeing the report and they both\nSeemed to have come to the conclusion that there's nothing additional so I think the comments from Senator who\nAre properly or the best indication of where Senator Flake as we've seen to this point a door and I would disagree with one word or that a senator Coontz gave and that set it hangs on a few Democrats and a few Republicans you might get some democratic votes but it doesn't hang on those Democrat votes it hangs in the three Republicans that we've been talking about\nThe New York times uh has a headlight out right now to key Republicans signaled satisfaction with FBI's Kavanaugh inquiry this report just oh it was released\nTo the center this morning I mean so it just for the last two hours those two are Jeff Flake and Susan Collins so we haven't heard anything yet for Lisa Murkowski she may not have had time to review anything get said this is going you know like some kind of order us that could be later the afternoon but expect that we will hear statements from uh\nUs that could be later the afternoon ... expect that we will hear\nStatements a from a from everyone in the U.S and especially those who put themselves in the position of being the deciding votes or who have made known that they are toss up votes they're undecided or to the public and so the yes they're going to get the focus so Jeff Flake and she was in college and made positive comments about\nUh the FBI in court that is not a statement to say they are definitely yes votes on Brett Kavanaugh though and the protests are raging in Washington\nA hyper partisan or you would think that if it was this hyper partisan maybe those Republicans would would realize that\nBut I Do think we're at a point again where do take it easy for granted and listen for the word to permit throughout the day that is what you're going to hear from Senate Democrats I guarantee it as many times did they get to speak to the media anytime they've got a microphone\nOr they'll start moving away from the FBI report quickly\nI think die if I may have done that with Chuck Schumer for them when they said they would do something there\nAnd they don't like that they don't like that there's nothing to take them bread capital personally a ordeal criminally are these allegations\nIn the airports so where they're going to move on and the movie going is he is a bad you know his temperament we don't like so we can't vote for him for that reason let's go back to the phones Tina is calling from Texas on line three\nTina welcome to Jay Sekulow lot\nThanks hike I had a call now um\n[noise] I don't understand why\nSome interest on both sides didn't get to keep their mouth shut from the get ... which way they were going to vote they would've said the American people and the Senate a lot of anger and frustration if they follow the constitution and that what\nWe are going to say yeah you're on a until we get to the point where we stay or nay I'll look back and forth\nIs really in my opinion specially like flake it's angering the American people\nWell I I I I think it makes sense that you don't immediately or make a statement about whether you support someone or not um before you even had the confirmation now remember Brett Kavanaugh has gone through this before as a Supreme Court nominee and\nUm and he's been confirmed by the U.S Senate and the U.S over three hundred ... I Do think it's fair to say you were inclined to vote yes where you're inclined to vote no based off that uh and uh and I think that's actually takes out a lot of the guessing game\nUm and you realize what is important uh whose votes are important ah whose votes are still um are you able to get if you will because that's just a political rally worried it would be great if you could actually to those Democrats would sit back and wait um and actually catch judgment not on\nJust oh I disagree with judicial philosophy but are qualified\nTo be adjusted Supreme Court which all indications ... capital but yes so they could really do that had to be very part is we don't like his use of Las ... that doesn't sit well with American voters so\nSo what they do ... he's a criminal except for care corroborate that\nSo what's next bottom like his temper I don't like the way he he responded to to me typical us there's I think they could just scream with people all the time\n... to people all the time and you got to treat them with kid gloves that's uh that's just not the case they're ... they're they're politicians\nDon't forget that there Paola ... statewide elected office holders um I I think again one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to the people to talk to us on the air there is a lot to go through about how how this moves forward\nUm there'll be a lot of debate in America I don't think there's going to be so much for the FBI report honestly I think that it's\nA no cooperation there may be some tidbits here there that are unique but they don't think there would be those kind of blanket statements coming out of both sides of the aisle\nIf there was anything there that\nIs the best case let me repeat that again for bread capital\nThey were not going to come out say Dr Ford is a liar these other people liars but they could have come out and found people who agreed with a story no where did that\nNot a single person no cooperation of the serious criminal accusations against Brett Kavanaugh so now the line of attack for Democrats is we don't like the way he acts or we don't like the way he sounds we don't like the way he responded\nThis is again just listed for temperament and temperament and temperament over and over again from the left and the next twenty four hours they're going to have time to take to for the U.S Senate and talk they're going to do the cable news interviews\nAre but I think what is so telling Diane Feinstein said which is that what is a was most interested in or was it was not there\nBecause there was nothing there to report about Brett Kavanaugh and these are written this allegations we come back in the second half hour of the broadcast to take your phone calls I brought up the discussion is well begin to continue to explain what will happen next which is so important I think people are ready for this would to wrap up [noise]\nUm and we're moving that way in positive direction\nOne eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to to talk to us on the air it's one eight hundred sixty eight for\nThree one zero follow the workday sealed J. A. C. L. J. dot or there's a lot going on\nOutside of this nomination vote that certainly going to be the focus of our broadcast through the week we'll be right back on ...\nIt's a critical time for a nation and for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more and more than ...\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the sea OJ online sign up right now the the L G daughter\nNow Democrats are claiming that the actual FBI background check they demanded is a sham or that it was too limited or the judge Tylenol is a temperament a is insufficient for the Supreme Court\nIn reality of course if Republicans remains strong whatever the Democrats do will not matter that is simply the bottom line\nAll right let's go right to the phones one eight hundred six eight four thirty one Ted Linda calling from Utah online for Linda welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nAnd they scan is it possible for let's say an edge to implement rules to stop last\nMinute sent missions as Feinstein dead for a few share um nominees for the Senate or fight firing and sorry for the Supreme Court\nYeah no I understand what you're saying I I don't think that there's a way to prevent that I mean at at\nListen they ... it would save that obviously if you're doing it the right way you bring this to the attention early in the process so that can be fully vetted\nJust a analyze behind the seeds of before everyone has to be dragged through the mud publicly but that wasn't the case this was an attempt to take out of this nomination a because the hearings that were to lose and actually the Democrats his barest themselves to those hearings a they have gotten us to forget that\nRight I mean I think most people have forgotten how embarrassing those hearings were forced to the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee so they moved to let's throw the salacious allegations out but then I don't know if there's any way\nThe Senate will always be part of ... it's it's that's who we elect based off the you know a a partisan or an issues so I don't think there's a way to stop it they may this may be a reason why they receive their strategies though and how how how to do this but this is classic\nA classic strategy in any situation but especially in politics that if you can't with all the issues take the person down within the allegations you can't\nDuring they don't think you'll see a specific rule in shrine about this because you always want to have the ability to consider new information if it comes up and it's credible but here's what I Will predict I Do think the next chairman\nOf the Judiciary Committee probably gonna be Lindsey Graham I think you'll see something probably in advance of an oven a new nominee well before there's nominees say look this is the way I Am going to handle the process\nWhen a nominee comes down anyone across America is going to have six weeks to get information that they would like considered by this committee to us before the hearing begins because we're going to go through a very robust process we're going to go through four days of hearings were going to go through meetings where you go through a closed session\nThat is your opportunity to be heard and quite frankly if you can't get us the information and this six months or six weeks then we're going to have deem it not important enough to have been a part of the process because you're not gonna waste the United states then it's time now again\nThat's not going to preclude something if it comes credible at the end Jordan but I Do think there's going to be every effort made by the next chairman to say look you've got a realistic six week window get us anything you want us to consider inside that window\nAlright folks back to the phones we go one eight hundred six a four thirty one to that's what a hundred and sixty four thirty one ten Paul calling from New York on line six Paul welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nHow are you a pop\nThe regular call at ... at the perfect leave where they just had that we don't new rules this guy will drag the mug rate we're going to happen concern hopefully ... chest that no we need to get the body that's what happened people out to be classic here or there was this for\nClinton so that will ... destroying of the nation that Congress call or die by by having a Chinese by about ... ... what is not allowed to get away into my baby getting spanked by my parents that at the ...\nI mean I get ... I get the anger I think that oftentimes ah maybe we do move forward too fast in politics so you know Brett Kavanaugh gets confirmed um this is going to stay for a long time it's going to seeing if he does get convert Brett Kavanaugh\nOr are those who supported his nomination and it's going to cause a real partisan raft\nUm was brought up different things that could be investigated for different reasons I think the truth is all these politicians are subject they they they they get job reviews as soon as every six years\nA there's a third of them up for reelection right now that is the best way to let people's voices be heard a rely on courts\nAnd law enforcement um for your political is is a last resort and even if there are legal issues there um listed that was not one of the FBI was not called in to do a criminal investigation of Dr Ford or bright capital\nIt was a supplemental background information or investigation but I ...\nThat what remains to be said I don't want to talk about this and the kinds of kind of\nMovie for how important the Supreme Court has but also how significant this could be politically\nI'm for both parties I mean if Brett Kavanaugh moves forward ... is it deflated to the left because uh ... if he moves forward gets confirmed as other court they threw they threw everything in the kitchen sink 'em and they they were not able to give it a a two Republicans to go their way\nI think you raise a very good question and with respect to the caller's question\nI Would recommend that the voters that are frustrated and upset with this ... to take out their anger on the Democrats by lining up to vote and vigorously support Republican candidates in the house and Senate\nThere's clear evidence on the ground if you look at recent poll result suggesting that is precisely what voters aren't doing\nRepublicans are now engaged in this political pros they recognize the unfairness of the process of that has gone on with respect to judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd hence they can take out their anger on someone and I think one of the the best things that they could do is to take it out at the ballot box All right\nLet's let's try grandmother call before the break remember our last segment the broadcast that is what we do we take your phone calls we try to it\nYour brother call before the break remember our last segment of

of that you do a quick question okay Kevin on what is he still working and if he does get confirmed he takes his place\nOkay so I ... it's that that I automatically somewhat takes his place to be another vacancy or the D.C court those are the ... that means that someone else can be nominated I'm there may already be vacancies there it is it's so there's constantly nominations moving people retiring\nFrom the circuit courts so it's not just like an automatic there is a lot of of seniority so there may be something that takes us in your tea place but it's it's not like they're it's not a vacancy like\nSupreme Court that somehow the the lower courts work I'm a those nominations can\nBe contagious at times usually moves through a much quicker with much less fanfare as is the nation's
