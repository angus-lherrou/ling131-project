Mexico and the United states\nWashington DC [noise] and now for the American Center for law and justice Jay Sekulow\nEverybody there's a lot to talk about I Want to start first with\nA more of these male bombs have been sent around the country I Want to say something very clear here that if you look at the definitions legally of acts of terrorism these are acts of terrorism doesn't a device does not have to be a detonated in order to be deemed an act of terrorists\nA device does not have to be a detonated in order to be deemed an act of terrorism in India is a former federal prosecutor you know that these incidents themselves can constitute do constitute actual\nTerrorists that's that's exactly correct you don't have to have a destination you don't have to have a blow up if you have an intent to harm somebody\nBy the use of a device that disease that had been sent a all over the country nine I Believe I have a has been identified so far\nThen that intense sufficient suffice is to constitute an act of terrorism under federal law and could be an acts of violence to the state laws too I mean it could do a mound to aggravated assault and even attempted murder\nSo Harry when you look at what's going on right now obviously we still don't know who's responsible for this but there's I don't think there can be any doubt that uh those that are responsible either individuals or groups or wherever it might be a having gauge in I just want to be clear on this because I think there's a lot of confusion in some of the media and it's these are still acts of terrorism\nAbsolutely so terrorism in the broader sense amounts to the use of violence as a means to create tear among the masses or in this particular case among particular individuals which will then fuel\nUm fear among the masses and said we now have at least nine devices that have been identified by the FBI targeting largely prominent Democrats a and a ... at least one media outlet\nUm and clearly um it it's time for action and we should not tolerate this a in a broad public that is committed to the rule of law\nOne of the things I Want to suggest here is that a while the FBI and a homeland security or all engaged\nThere's both federal and state law components to this I won't come back after the break we're going to talk about what's going on in Mexico and the intervention action is going on down there but as it relates to these these are the the the these pipe bombs and ... you mentioned is as important people understand I Want to understand their estate components to that\nHe has of course there are two sovereign does here involve the United states and federal law that applies\nTo prescribe them prohibit terroristic devices such as these which is Harry mentioned are designed to harm human life\nBut they're also stay crimes involved because each state has a right to enforce its criminal laws within its own jurisdiction within its own boundaries and that would involve as I said\nThe possibility of aggravated assault even acts of terrorism that may be a violate violent of of state law provisions and certainly a good reached that level of attempted murder because\nThese things could kill people and that's the intent of whoever the lunatic crazed cinder or centers of these are devices his Jay well\nLook this is one of these situations I think we have to be clear here that I'm not only local and federal law enforcement above it all was a need to be vigilant as this matter becomes again under investigation and hopefully they'll find out who the perpetrator of this was an added this is not by the way I Want to say this clearly\nI this is not I don't look I don't view this as a Republican Democrat independent libertarian issued this is an American issue when someone tries to engage in this kind of activity targeting I'm\nIn this particular case primarily political leaders\nIt's wrong period when the uh attempts at a to a really assassinate seeps lease and others are in Washington DC during the congressional a softball game it just it was the same kinds of things that there's not a Republican Democrat\nIssue is an American issue we don't allow acts of terror we prosecute those ... fortunately here so far our law enforcement has been able to prevent and I think that's a a a big step in and it's a positive step to so far there's been no injuries that by the way there are injuries because people are going to go down buildings ... flights of stairs and be evacuated\nSo let me tell you something that strikes fear and that's why terrorism statues are written now all the way they are we come back from the break we're going to get updates on what's happening in the situation in Mexico a with we've been advocating for\nIntervention in an appropriate way diplomatically both for more border confrontation where and talk more about that we come back from the break we'll also take your phone calls at one eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero

A. C. O. J.\nThat diplomatic negotiations are in essential in resolving this crisis we have suggested that such efforts should be aimed at stemming the flow of migrants slowing them down and by stopping them before they reach us ports of entry\nAnd so late yesterday CNN reported on negotiations between the United states and Mexico on how to handle the migrant\nA caravan and I'm sure there are additional negotiations in discussions that are ongoing or between Mike pump pale and his Mexican counterpart\nAnd between the president of the United states and the leader of the Mexican government\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today as easy to do the ... sign up Jay\nHas everyone first of all we are of course condemning we consider acts of terrorism that taking place now with nine suspicious packages that looked like pipe bombs address to a\nNow the ... vice president Biden or the actor Robert Deniro look these are acts of terrorism whether the device goes off or not we said that the beginning program I'm going to say it again that violates federal and state law for a reason because you had people have to evacuate buildings and that it itself causes accept there isn't I mean it's a result that there\nIt is I mean it is a consequence of tears to inconvenience people to put fear into them and that's the idea that is what their means to put fear into people to make them apprehensive of their safety to put them in a position in which they're not even saver secure in their own home\nAnd this is ridiculous and horrific thing that is happening regardless of the political persuasion Jay whether it's left or right where centers or whatever it is that's not the way that we express political sentiment in the United states where dissent or disagreement with our fellow Americans that is not the proper procedure\nLike we're taking your calls and comments also one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten if you're a baseball can parents go put those in I've got one from Cheryl in Facebook she says what are the chances we'll coordinate with Mexico to set up safe zones in reading before they reached the border Harry we advocated very early on for a engaging with\nUh Mexico diplomatically to try to avoid confrontation at the border what about this idea of a safe zone inside of Mexico\nWell I think that idea has some merit and that could indeed be part of the ongoing negotiations between the United states\nAnd Mexico it's also important to note that there are many a civil organizations in the United states that are prepared to reach out and to help\nIn Mexico with respect to members of the migrant caravan\nSo going forward uh this is an idea that perhaps should be on the table but we should do everything in our power to ensure that the caravan does not reach us ports of entry and so I Would uh certainly welcome additional ideas\nOr with respect to negotiations that are ongoing between the United states\nAnd Mexico are going forward\nBlanket on Facebook and by the way again we'll take your calls at eight hundred sixty four thirty one tent and what what the question of what you do on handling this what would recommendations would you have and what do you think the appropriate response should be a blender baseball gas is a why is there such a large discrepancy in the reporting numbers\nOf migrants in the care of and I think there's three answers to that one is look there were some reports initially that was seven thousand than a media reports out of Mexico said upwards of fourteen thousand then today the report saying twenty three thousand and then there was a report saying ten thousand\nThis is a long journey these people are on and I think people come and go that's part of it\nAnd it's hard to get an accurate assessment department of homeland security though you know that we have I'm sure Americans are on the ground\nIn the area already dealing with the Mexican counterparts uh that's part of this but the the real problem here is we want to avoid a border clash I mean I don't think that's good for the migrants I don't think that's good for the American people and it's not certainly not good for our border agents ... so we've got to figure out what the right thing to do is you can't just let fourteen thousand people in the United states that may sound\nYou're what the right thing to do is you can't just let fourteen thousand people in the United states that may sound like a quick backs but\nIt's just impossible we don't know who the people are I Do worry about look I I think I'm going to say best majorities people are legitimately seeking a better life they're coming out of Honduras with living on less than a dollar a day a third of the population so let's say that for a moment let's make that a given\nHaving said that there are also bad people in the wind at the numbers no but do we know that sex traffickers use the southern border as route of access to the United states for sex trafficking yes we do\nThat not only shown by studying shown by cases so that's why you got ... ... it's a horrific problem sex trafficking issue and that doesn't get politically irrelevant what side you're nobody can be in favor of what's going on in that regard but this is a you got to be diplomatic\nAnd it's a delicate situation Andy it is a delicate situation and I think we're fooling ourselves and we're being very nice if we don't think that there's sex traffickers are in this hordes of people Jay because there is that's how they bring children\nAnd others are that they use and manipulate for these horrific crimes\nI into the United states they bring them parading them as their children or their relatives and so forth and they're real aim is to get them to the United states and put them in the Dan's these ethnic would is Dan Dan's\nAnd use them as sex slaves you had a job he was in your essay or work or prosecutors you know cases in the ... Britain's judicial circuit in South Georgia\nAnd we've seen cases in which there are immigrants who are sensibly coming to find a better life in the United states\nBut they ended up being put into a room and they're sold and their Indian captives bonded you basically had sex traffickers in these come from all parts of the world\nAnd we found them out on on American soil so we've got to be careful and not be naive about thinking that every single one of these migrants is here or seeking a legitimate life in one questions as you said earlier what have these countries Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador done\nWith the five hundred million dollars in the United states aid that was given and twenty seven ...\nWell no votes and that that's that's a significant issue and\nAnd I shouldn't have a problem in April of this year there was also a caravan\nAnd that caravan which followed a similar past reached a about their peak point was about Fifteen hundred members as across Mexico on the way to the United states by the time it reached Tijuana San Diego border crossing the care manage window down to a few hundred\nUSA Today reports data from the government agencies showing born one members of the Caribbean requested asylum at the port of entry and Ninety three of those\nPast initial asylum tests and additional under twenty do you remember the men were arrested for attempting to enter the United states illegally so it's ... ... if the numbers not ten thousand\nYou can handle it and that's the the issue here but again avoiding a confrontation working with our counterparts in the region this particular case in Mexico which critical but from Honduras and Guatemala's while area\nAbsolutely so one of the things that we should focus on is the source of the problem and if we look at this from a global perspective or a broader perspective\nOn many of the problems arise internally with a Honduran government was Marlon government with the Salvadoran government\nAre they taking affirmative steps to improve the lives of their own people are using the resources that they receive from the United states government and the American people appropriately\nAnd I think the answer to those questions is at the moment I'm no\nThey are not advancing the interest of their own people so we should work to ensure that the governments in those countries actually improve the lives of their people or indeed there will be consequences in terms of reduction in funding from the United states\nSo Pam on Facebook asked this question I heard there was a second caravan with just started in Honduras\nIs that true and paying the answer is yes there's a report right now that another caravan of about a thousand people has started making a point of exit out of Honduras so that is happening or as well pat on Facebook says it this way isn't deterred would set a bad precedent\nOf course it does I mean you can't have your borders overrun but again I Want to I I think intervention here was smart early in Mexico I think that is the appropriate way but this is going to be handled I Want to close this segment of broadcast turning back to the pipe bomb situation I Want to make a position very clear we believe these are actual terror\nThere's some people are saying they really are they real bombs we know if they're if they're not real bombs that would still be acts of terror\nSo let's take the politics out of this and and that's what they said these are acts of terror there they're designed to provoke Tara [noise]\nAnd there are federal and state laws anti we've set it once we only got thirty seconds left but said\nAgain it is a violation of federal law of course to engage in acts\nSuch as this and that is also a violation of the law of every state in which these pipe bombs\nOr whatever they're busy these explosive devices are they could be aggravated assaults and could be a salt within tend to commit a serious disfigurement Bali disfigurement which is an aggravated assault they could even rise to the level Jay of attempted murder\nAll right we're taking your calls one eight hundred six eight ... three one zero that's eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time we come back when the rate we're for another thirty minutes you're not getting old broadcast sort of baseball periscope or a C. L. J. dot or\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country you know the worst of the American Center for launches has never been more and more on them right now\nAt the seals were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now ... daughter\nTowards the United states they do lose people as they get closer and closer people fall off a but uh but still I mean this is this is nearly ... times the size of what we experienced April here So Harry\n... joined mentions it back to visit us backed group which is not surprising so then you start thinking these are orchestrated for what reason while the people are suffering we don't doubt that we don't like the way the money is being handled by these governments and we give them billions of dollars a year hundreds of millions of dollars a year but there is this whole movement if you will to try to create these crisis is\nI think you're absolutely correct so essentially this American base in geo has launched an assault on the United states border sovereignty\nAnd that's consistent with the fracturing of a bipartisan consensus opposing illegal immigration so if you go back\nPerhaps even by six years ago you would have individuals like President Obama Hillary Clinton a Joe Biden opposing view legal immigration\nA but today that bipartisan consensus has been fractured and so I think this NGOs sees a political opening\nAnd it is used in people who may indeed be legitimate refugees they're clearly suffering in Honduras or elsewhere\nOr they are using those individuals for political purposes and so one of the things that the American administration needs to think about is how do we deal with a problem\nThat was perhaps propelled and initiated for a political purpose\nHow do we calibrate all response that is careful not to engage in an overreaction careful not to lead to a crisis at our border\nAnd so what we need to do is to continue to engage in negotiations with the Central American authorities particularly in Mexico\nA to diffuse this crisis\nEven if it was initiated for political purposes\nJudy on Facebook or as she said this appears to be a catch twenty two from the United states\nWhat is the best case outcome for this scenario look legitimate asylum seekers is supposed to take asylum in the first country there where they could go to that they're safe that's not what's going on here look we should always for trying to protect legitimate asylum seekers I don't think there's any question about that\nBut when you got this attempt to rush the border which I don't think this is going to end up being at the end of the day I don't think it's I think it's going to dissipate out it looks like it as it may not\nAh with this idea of rushing the borders to make some kind of point where you think fourteen thousand people just in a rush through our borders in uh in Texas or in California is absurd\nBut understand that's why the intervention diplomatically at this particular moment with Mexico Honduras Guatemala is very very critical yeah that that's right you've got to work with\nEspecially you've got a hundred president\nIt's a conservative who said returned home a vast majority of people are from Honduras up it's gaining steam with other countries that they move through that we will help you uh there's leftist politicians there of course are doing the opposite trying to push people out to join and continue to support this caravan\nSo we should work with the leaders\nIn Central America that are willing to work with the United states this is a crisis for Mexico as well\nWe have resources that we can provide\nTo help the Mexican government we could work together and solve this before it reaches the U.S border or we don't need a situation where there are thousands of people to sort through at the U.S border including a people that have been identified by the department of homeland security is\nI'm not all of this but but ... but there have been criminals identified middle Easterners Africans a people from all over the world who are not even Central American as part of this caravan CNN\nOr that you've got the fact that you have people from various countries or if they're coming out of Africa like you said in the middle east you ask yourself this question because those people seek legitimate asylum status maybe they could if they went through a ... on a normal process but why are they the caravan coming out of one of my life yeah and\nAnd why are they did a ... a silent like if you're if you're suffering in Africa and you've got to Guatemala and I I don't even know where else she went in between let's say you got there ... ... you'd be safer than in Honduras well that's where under the law\nYou would lead to claim asylum or and so you'd have to make a case if you've got to the U.S that you weren't safe there it's not an economic issue asylum it is is purely a safety issue or to have asylum declare does that mean to your life is in danger\nAnd and uh so again it's usually the first place you lay it is the metal that's the law that ... that's the law and the U.S does look that law though unfortunately it's not always strictly applied as as sometimes people are considered passing through or similar conditions but\nThere's no way Central America is similar to the middle east or similar to uh somewhere in Africa or anywhere else in the world ... south east\nAsia Susanna Facebook several successful resolution deter other caravan from happening\nI think look yes ah in the sense that those that Jordan mentioned to get a group that's funding that side of the United states that's you know may well be for political purposes uh we're we're we've got an election\nThat's around the corner so you've got the these kinds of things happen uh having said that they did one in April so it's not strictly that but I think we have to be we have to make sure we're a country look I Am very sympathetic you know I you know this that it wasn't his broadcasts I've called for comprehensive immigration reform\nOr immigration system does not work I mean we're we're kidding ourselves we don't think that if we think it's working it's not\nSo we need to do with my grandfather came through Ellis Island and there was a process we have to have a better way but now the technology have better processes but we have to have processes and we have to have laws and in the area where government a loss\nThat is absolutely correct It's also important to note but consistent with three fashioning\nOur immigration laws because the system is indeed broken we should continue to note that people respond to incentives and to deterrence and so one of the issues that\nDidn't and to deterrence\nAnd so one of the issues that out there of course is the fact that we indeed do have a largely open border\nCrossing in the southern part of the United states and so we need to take direct an unmistakable action or to close that particular border and to this student center by additional caravans from starting in Central America or or elsewhere\nOr I'm going forward or bought at the same time the American people have a role in that and that is to push for a bipartisan consensus a re establishing a our borders\nAll right we're going to be taking your calls and comments we come back in the last segment the broadcast at one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero\nYour comments and all this was the last segment we take questions on friday of topics one eight hundred six eight ... three one zero if you are
