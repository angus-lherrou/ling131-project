[noise]\nTalk\nAbout in your\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie I Want\nThe FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting [noise] ah\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigation whatever that means according to the senators and the Republicans and Republican majority I Want them to do\nPhone lines are open for your questions right now call one eight hundred sixty four three one one\nOpen for your questions right now call one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero\nListed witnesses is only beginning it's not the end of what the FBI leaves to give and anything short of a full fair investigation will be ...\nStraight jak Haitians\nShe's counsel for the American Center for law and justice case secular [noise]\nWell there's a lot of news being made a yesterday and today about the nature and scope\nOf the inquiry into judge Kavanaugh's background that's mean conducted by the FBI you're hearing terms like expansive or the fact is the president actually use the phrase comprehensive\nUh but I think it's very important to point out what this is and what this is not this is not a criminal investigation so I let let's go back to the basics of what we happier this is not an ongoing criminal investigation this is a background investigation not that it's not important but it has um\nThe president wants to be comprehensive any what does that mean comprehensive name former U.S attorney\nIt means following all the leaves to to where they take you comprehensive means if someone says something you check it out and you check it out again\nFollow all the leads to see where the facts take you but this is not and I don't think it really should be counted in terms of a criminal investigation there has been no allegation of a crime ... in the federal system the FBI is continuing to do its background investigation of this nominee\nDuring how do you see it now we're on we're Tuesday yeah whoa it's supposed to we're going to go over with than in a little bit over the schedule but how do you see it right now lay\nHiring is very important to you know I think that you know dragging this out for\nPast this week week and is a very difficult for\nThe American people because this is the story that his big padded every single day um I think it just gives more types of those who oppose judge have it or\nNot because of these allegations by the way but because of its judicial philosophy um that they did they opposed to come up with more people more information so this FBI investigation which I'm sure it has been thorough and comprehensive needs to come to a closed out as\nEven Kobe admitted they could easily do this is the seven day window that they've been given he didn't like the seventh day window but he said they can do it and so you've got the\nFBI are this which is what the Democrats said they wanted that's ever going to be enough for them but let's get a report to the White House to the ... or say that um and let them read it\nLet them see it and then have a vote\n... where do you see it right now here well it's important to note that the Supreme Court convinced it's term this week yesterday and yet the nominees a confirmation remains on hold pending the FBI background check\nAt the same time the attacks on the nominee are multiplying\nOr the latest attacks suggest that he threw ice at someone or in a bar\nAnd so it's also important to take a step back and look at the primary allegations a number of them are are beginning to fall apart so the Democrats are going to continue to ask for more and more\nUh investigation yeah they want the FBI to interview more and more people so he faces a difficult hurdles going forward I I'm I think there's going to be a shift you're seeing a shift of strategy\nOn where this is going in the next twenty four hours and we're talking about that after the break then you just came out of a series of meetings they'll give us what is your best assessment right now where things are [noise]\nWell Senator McConnell said there would be a vote this week and joins correct it needs to happen this week gay because we can only do I do believe it's going to because here here's why the president wants all the information out rightfully so but ultimately want that information is out Jay the constitution gives the United States Senate the duty to decide they need to vote and I think that both going to happen\nThis week we're talking about all of this where this is actually going what I think the next area of attacks going to be and where to take your calls\nTo discuss all of this at one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero that's eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten will take your calls we come back from the break if you're on Facebook and prayers go hit your questions in right now or social media teams are evaluating how reviewing those comments as they come and we'll be back\n[noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation

J. thought\nHistoric move now the United states is December the in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf the state of Israel and it's very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies abound\nISIS among the law in Iran all pledge white Israel from the very severe in his new book York Times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem\nBiblical and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear irrefutable evidence\nTo remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal ... reported by Israel send\nUs your coffee today in Jerusalem of biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born [noise]\nHere's what I think is happening let me give you my analysis so the first thing you had was when this nomination went under way they attack judicial philosophy they say that you know we don't like his position as we don't like the uh they too conservative we'll like one of these particular views you've got three hundred opinions is a judicial conservative he doesn't believe in a living constitution that was the attack\nHe goes to a hearing that's not successful then they bring up the late last minute allegations are regarding doctor for bad hearing goes and a creates a issues\nThat are not been again no cooperating witnesses on Dr Ford but lo and behold ad that's unfolding to other witness or two other potential\nUh individuals come forward or ... M Ms ... and uh the the client of a a sweat Nick missed what the client of Michael ... they come forward\nSo now you're saying that it's not just allegations of what their sexual assault which will be serious and another itself obviously but now it's also a judicial temperament credibility did he make false statements under oath about his activities in college this is where I so you're never going to get the ...\nIt's about his activities in college this is where I so you're never going to get those that are opposed his nomination on board with him what you're trying here to do what the Republicans are trying to do is can they hold three senators flake\nBeing one of them a senator Collins and Murkowski that's what they that's where the focus is right now yeah absolutely\nIt's you're talking about a handful of senators if this is going to move forward that too is important um because it's either I think it's very clear those those those handful vote over that I think you get maybe a couple of Democrats or the nomination goes down\nAnd the question also would be is while we're talking about this let's be honest or will there ever be a vote\n'em or will the nomination would be pulled that's also a political calculation right now it appears that we're going to say a bit of Washington that it appears that we're heading towards the vote\nEven if it's even if it's like the health care I compared to like that situation like the health care vote where um we didn't know until the late Senator John McCain voted where it was going I mean but they decided to have the vote and and uh and things change I Would imagine though unlike that than\nThis is somewhat different I Can't imagine a college or Murkowski not putting out their statement before they voted 'cause this is so serious\nWhat do you think that I I think I think that's a great comparison joined I think there are a bunch of senators and the Democrat side of the aisle probably senator Manchin center high camp and senator Donnelly who don't want to take this vote so you know you have to ask a question to the very end whether or not it's called I agree with you and senator Collins and Murkowski Senator Flake as well by the way because remember before consideration and\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today was easy to do is go online you sign up L. J.\n[noise]\n\nBack to the broadcast here's what Senator Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor\nToday but here's what the hell out of ... one thing for sure [noise] the Senate will vote\nOn George Cabot all\nHear all this for this week here on the floor\nThis week All right I'm gonna go we're going to go around the horn and asked so than you've been in the meetings do you think that will happen I I\nDo I would caution you is this the J we've heard that before from leader McConnell on this nomination I mean so look I think the timeline is set up where it will happen this week I think it should happen this week I think the information will be in and ultimately to answer your question I Do think it will happen however um he said that it's not happened before\nSo [laughter] ... well I agree with fans analysis but I Would add a cautionary note uh it strikes me that we are dealing with um again that continues to expand and so\nThere may indeed be another move that has to be played going forward and what do you\nWant to take Mitch McConnell at his word this time and say that I agree with him and I think it will will come this week and I think it will be on friday\nOr Mr skeptic um I don't\nEver trust the voting because we don't know this report I think that that's the issue is that I mean he he's schedule it\nUm I Do think it should happen I I Believe that that's yeah that Brett Kavanaugh's best chance to actually get tougher uh but I think this\nThese are important calls coming in and we have a good comedy that goes with let's take the call first they don't get the comment that came in as well which is called talk to the at Virginia on line to defects are holding on your on the air ID\nNow Jay do you think that President and made the right decision by letting the FBI next time instead of just we have you been there and that\nWas a good man I'm going to go back and they got all this stuff on hand you know\nGet my I think I think the president I think the president did the right thing by I think he did the right thing or because\nYou had three senators and so they were saying that they weren't going to vote yes\nUnless they had this additional investigation which means you would not have been confirmed so the president looked at the political realities of the moment he is the art of the deal guy he looked at the political reality at three senators at the on the Republican saying we want to have this\nAnd at that point I think he had no choice and the word he uses comprehensive they're now some are saying expanse of yeah it's really comprehensive method of payment on Facebook his writing in the ass he says what does that mean comprehensive\nAs well and one of the company ... what does that\nFull complete follow all the leads take the facts where they go\nFollow all the investigative leads that come up when you interview somebody if they name a name\nPut that name down in other words making full and complete and sorrow that doesn't mean expand it so like that like the Democrats won two hundred and fifty thousand people who may have known Gavin all through the years heard his name investigated that's ridiculous he wants to\nLimited in scope to those remember what the president said that\nThe Republican senators want another one\nThose remember what the president said that the Republican senators want in other words he is doing this for Murkowski Collins and it's like\nYeah go ahead and that's one of the reasons why you when the question is do the right thing he had no choice\nYeah the only other choice was to pull the nomination uh uh\nWell they have and so very early by the way that would have been very early to do it without tried\nThe bombs you know I look I think when I was there could be I think there's going to be a boat when they play with the president actually yeah we're talking about what he said well it's actually listen to the to what he said\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like a you know just starting [noise] ah I Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nMeans according to the senators and the Republicans and Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin Oh I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing that would that being said I'd like to go quickly and the reason I like it to go quickly very simple because it's unfair to have them at this point well\nI mean the leaving him dangling yeah it's not right so the FBI needs to be moving expeditiously and should be able to conclude this without any you're saying with no question that you be able to conclude at where they could both this way\nThere's no doubt that it can be done I mean the FBI agent here no we're not we're not starting from scratch and we have no lead no way no idea where criminal might be or what the all the facts are that's not what this is this is a background investigation there's resources do it\nYeah I I I just think this is the key week this is the key weaken and I think you're concerned if it goes past at me he said this before we weren't sure if he if he gets ... ... if you go past the specific uh\nAllegations which he has denied what'd you are and I'm Sorry ... but you get into words he used to have all the heat pass out like he went to sleep which he said he did\nFor drinking or did he blackout which was he said he did not do that's a ... you know it is you never see 'em but there's a difference between\nA going to sleep and then continuing to act you know without ... I can but here's ... but again that I bring that up not to test this bird you know I don't I mean I think what's happened is horrendous to say that part of this could have nothing to do if he did he think with with these women correct\nThat well that's why I think it's moved that's why I think\nA thin it's has moved in to pay I look at the ... one was again let me just reach database one\nJudicial qualifications judicial philosophy you pass the test reluctantly by the Democrats buddy pass it then they go on the attack the attack when it comes to sexual assault serious hearings open up that goes forward inconclusive no cooperating evidence so kind of been inconclusive so what do they go page three\nStatements he said under oath may not have been through there is a veracity issue that and I think we're base three space for it it gets worse than that but we're basically right now but how do you see it and do you think that both apple you said you think the boats going to happen is he going to be confirmed\nI I think the vote will happen\nI think there's a greater chance but not that he will be confirmed Jay but look just to underscore the point you just made I think that goes past this week you have crystal clear evidence\nThat what is being pursued here is not the truth I mean because you were just a matter of days ago that Chris Coons\nAnd Jeff Flake made this deal that said look we're ready to make our decision if you get the FBI one week to look at these allegations then we'll have the information that we need to make a vote or J. if that goalpost it's changed again I Will tell you a certain due to the United States Senate does the detractors of Brett Kavanaugh\nAre not looking for truth or evidence on which to base their decisions and they just never want to take the vote so I Do think that vote is going to happen and I will tell you that if it doesn't happen I think there is a commitment inside the United States Senate to just delaying until the nominee has withdrawn and\nFrankly I think that's an affront to the constitution you think that as an obstacle ... do you think that's a possibility here\nYes it's a possibility but I did the scheduling to the voters up to one person and that's leader McConnell I think he knew we have at the center for time you know we don't because we don't have culture\nWe don't you will know the answer to that tomorrow night Jay when the FAA builds finished if leader McConnell files cloture tomorrow night I think you can get a well close up without a FBI investigation and I can play without the three oh Tucson beard\nHe could but I don't think he will but basically you need three days after finally closure before you hear about on them you could go right into next week\nYeah I mean look how many pages looking at this I mean everything has to line up perfectly for this to go to be done this week\n[noise] ... you are absolutely crime and that's really where we are ... meantime of course the Democrats are coming up with more and more fresh allegations which may not necessarily be grounded in any fact [noise]\nAll right we're taking a break up you don't get to pull out with a program go over to ACL Jay dot org or any of our multiple social media platforms periscope Facebook we've got the TV version of the broadcast going there each and every day we do it not just live radio we do a live TV program and there's a difference during those breaks\nWe're taking were talking during those banks were given a special videos are there are team put together so there's a lot to do here we encourage or an ACL Jay dot org or Facebook or parents go right now if you're on Facebook would periscope encourage you to share it with your Brent [noise] hey call\nWith questions you might not but one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tenets eight hundred sixty four three one wonder or don't forget support to work in the field J. A. C. O. J. dot org ... a C. L. J. dot org back one more second half hour broadcast just a moment\nIt's a critical time for nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for law and justice has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now\n... daughter\nHonestly because because let's all\nLet's put this suggests comic terms as much as we like to see something happened to the staff that likely leak this information or\nIt could also be that the doctor for gave the green light I mean or the attorneys gave the green light um the way that die if I'd say we're saying it was confidential but not not to ever be you know it was it was very carefully worded\nThe truth is this should be about the confirmation itself that is what is important is Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court Harry to me we don't need to be distracted we can be upset and I think we saw that in the hearings for past that now\nWe have now moved past that point I mean as much as you said I like it the information's there the FBI is now doing a background check check on it the the big issue is does Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed die if I see is the capital to her voters that's who decides a and and so we're all those other senators on the Judiciary Committee\nAbsolutely so it's up to the Senate to decide whether or not to investigate\nA Senator Feinstein but the key issue is whether the Senate\nWill exercise its advice and consent role as the constitution requires\nAnd so if we look at all of the allegation some of which are collapsing before our very eyes or it's important not to be distracted by the new avenues of attack\nLaunched by the Democrats\nInstead the Senate Republicans should focus on the facts yes they should wait for the FBI a background check to be completed and I hope it's ... I ... I Hope it's comprehensive\nBut once that's completed a Senator McConnell the Senate majority leader should schedule a boat the boat should be held and the Republicans should be held accountable to the voters in their districts\nAnd if they're unwilling to do their job then I think it will be up to the voters to decide what comes next\nTerry's calling from New York on line for ... even hold on to call back in ... to get right to your call thanks for being with us\nAll right thanks I mean really I'm very upset about this whole thing I mean that just really comes down to the Democrats trying to run the country without being in power really is what they're trying to do but my question to you guys is\nRepublican bloody that they can\nRepublicans are the ... [laughter]\nI mean let's be honest I don't have the strongest of leaders we've said that a number of times sometimes they do good things but they weren't able to do it a deliver and they were able to deliver other tax cuts they weren't able to deliver on health care of so far they've not been able to deliver for President Trump on the wall this is while they're the majority\nThis is why I think that there are Terry their majorities in question right now in both the Senate and the house for these midterms is because their week this is is even I think a magnified by our presidents straight but go ahead ...\nBy someone and bottom line question is I think Jeff Flake and just going to be the John like John McCain of this vote he's going to say no no matter what just to be a hero and get attention on himself I really do\nBut I'm just wondering if the two ladies to Republican ladies if they get to the end of his actual claims are not something that can be proven or you just think\nThey're going to let me just explain ... do you think you could lose Jeff Flake and gets Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski than is is that\nThis block that we keep hearing that meeting together talking together or is that is that a potential even that you could still lose someone like Jeff Flake who is retiring but but keep Murkowski and college\nYeah I I think all of that in play at this point or any at one point it looked like mansion in high ... Murkowski we're all going to vote together but then you saw senator Donnelly leave that and announces no vote now\nMaybe that'll change with the FBI investigation honestly during if I were going to rank those three Republican but I think senator Collins is probably the most likely to support Brett Kavanaugh or Jeff Flake is next and I would put Lisa Murkowski as a I I still things you both fifty percent but she's probably the least likely to support him of those three\nI mean Jeff Flake said I mean this is this is at the end of the Atlantic that he says we can't have that kind of partisanship out of the court when talking about Brett Kavanaugh so he's keeping\nAndy his his options like he did he how he said he'll move to vote afford that he wants the FBI investigation but now he's brought up a new reason this was that the reason he didn't he he wanted the FBI but he didn't say what an FBI investigation more time to think about how he conducted himself at the hearing but now he\nWants to add that it now he's worried about what the court's gonna look lie with him up there and how far does and it's going to be this is a Republican yeah he well he nominally a Republican who would not have made it in the primary and sort of decided not to run at all so I mean I wouldn't trust judge ... I mean senator flags vote at all I don't think he's going to get that vote\nAnd but we can only afford the Republicans to lose one\nAnd I do think that a sans analysis that the that senator Collins is the most likely to vote for the nomination is is accurate but don't count on Jeff Flake and don't count on Murkowski\nI mean this is someone who says uh uh now he keeps getting rattled all these reporters say he's rattled he's around so even when they tried to get his confirmation of what did you mean that yeah we can't have that kind of partisanship out of the court and then he tried to say rushed away by handlers big rattled his house reported\nUm I wasn't referring to him I mean\nYeah this is again this is why it's up to the air this is where I could throw a heads up your watch a Facebook your parents go because you cannot figure out\nAre these social take another call before we get to the brakes people but hold on a Robert calling from New Jersey on line three Robert welcome to Jay Sekulow alive [laughter]\nThank you for taking my call quick question are we knew there would be more allegations ... like questionnaires the FBI or they fail to investigate or interview all of them or can they draw the line\nYou know the ... and the FBI does not have to investigate every single name that is put forward I mean you could give a two hundred names and go out and do that that doesn't make sense what they need to do what they do is their supervisor said\nAnd since you go out and do that that doesn't make sense what they need to do what they do is their supervisors say these are the most viable the most critical persons that need to be investigated because of their allegations are there are potential knowledge of what Kevin did or didn't do while he was at Yale or other places\nAnd this is what and then they cut it off and then because there is a time constrained here I Hope uh by tomorrow night Wednesday so it's not an open ended let's just go on an investigator for the next you know nine months and see what happens so the there are constraints on the FBI based on the rule of reason\nAlright hum we've only got a minute left or the second we come back and her final segment we take all of your phone calls and we go right through so we we quickly get to the phone calls so people who are holding on to stay on and if you are or wants to be on the broadcast this is the time to call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we got one ... one line open\nBecause we took the call right now one eight hundred\nSix eight for three one one zero critical
