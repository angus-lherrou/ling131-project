I think it's really important you hear the words especially now that some time has gone up because look this is what happens with these cases they're out\nThey come out there is an initial flurry of news coverage and then it goes quiet as a pastor and his wife and family return to light back in the United states that are waiting for their next assignment and taking some time for freshmen and

I'll take a call in a minute here but I I Andrew set for the folks what you were ... how long you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\n[noise] ... we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and preach to this Christ\nOne of the main things we were involved in with church planting we're of all that several church plants and then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAnd he's the OJ member today it's easy to do online signed L. J. on\n[noise]\nWe're joined by pastor Andrew Brunson were thrilled to have in the first time we've had him on a radio\nBroadcast obviously just out of a turkey and we're glad that he's home in the United states having said that I Know pastor your heart though is for the most for the people of turkey and I'm sure that has not changed\nBut no we we still love turkey or ... years ago and we are expecting that there will be a great artist in Turkey\nYep so who do you talked about the first year you said you were broken in January we covered ear extensively you had a ... you were in a jail with twenty two people that was originally designed for eight or you had very harsh conditions are talking about the second year\nYeah so the first year of feel like I was broken down and a shattered again and again and then the second year it's when I feel that God began to rebuild me\nAnd a lot of that happened uh just what small victories\nA big uh declaring truth declaring that God is with me uh I think of as a fifty ten became averse for me where a boy were walking in the dark we hold on to our God so I felt that I was walking in the dark and uh\nIt was a time when I began to rebuild missile I wrote a song or I'm declaring has a lot for me and his faithfulness and especially focusing on the idea of endearing till the end and uh being faithful and that\nWell you certainly have been and and that's great see see I Know that we I remember in this very studio\nWhen we were first talking about those conditions are in the prison how cold it was on the number of people it was the people that this is a hundred year in Britain in any where it's not great but you can imagine in the country like turkey or it's these are pretty awful conditions\nYeah and let's say you know terrible condition and you know I was able to talk to Noreen and during the legal process you know I could give hope through what these steps are course we didn't know what Chuck humans do\nBut then as a Christian trying to get help ... you know even when you don't see it we have now the gods and now he's working and saying you know I Know that that was a hard process and when you're in a Turkish printing to see what's forgetting that can where's the help and that\nAnd that on Facebook says your testimonies incredible God Bless you pastor Brunson you want to go yeah I I was going to ask a pastor Brunson\nA question about the people he was in prison way it used to spend on ABC News\nBut the idea that it with some really rough people considering that you were so high profile\nI always wanted to underscore that to our us audience how high profile you weren't turkey like you said when the economy went bad when the two officials were saying should they blamed Andrew Brunson turkey ah they they made you have to be this kind of super spy in the Turkish media\nAnd then you get put into jail cells with people a predominantly Muslim or who have read a ... a pretty salacious things about you [noise]\nWell what happened is that\nUh at the beginning I was in high profile and they treated me they treated all of the other people are accused of being part of the coup attempt and being a part of the good line that's movement which say\nIt's basically an Islamic movement and so at the beginning of the difficulty I never complained about the physical conditions I was at a whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more the\nOr whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was in prison [laughter] definitely and the truth is it a lot of the people I was in prison with a word choose to being part of the gulags movement and there are police officers or military or\nA ... they were just very strong Muslims and the most difficult thing for me during that time with the spiritual environment because they were all very committed\nVery strong some so there were constant prayers going on recitation of the Koran that was like a Muslim ... prayer twenty four seven uh and I was only Christian and I had no fellowship or\nAnyone to pray with so the the spiritual environment was difficult as I became more ... higher profile after President Trump asked for me at the summit that he had made two thousand Seventeen then I'm within a couple of months they moved me from that sell\nTo a maximum to a higher security prison that I had been in a and put me in a smaller so with with just a two other people and the reason they did that was to provide more security so that people would not hurt me in any way so nothing what happened\nRight let's go right to the phones were holding on to talk to your pastor Brunson Laura in North Carolina online find Laura welcome to Jason you'll live\nThank you I Want to thank you I really do a little nervous hair era humble [noise] um [noise] and\nThank you for what you know I'm so glad that you're back home I mean they're praying for you than not we ... we saw that come up I\nSigned the thing on line that that petition online and was not ...\n... or ... down and praying with uh our president\nYou let me ask you about that let me ask you about that one uh Andrew that was quite a moment I mean I'm I've been in that room on on many occasions but that was certainly a different one what was your sense of that I mean I Know you wanted to do it you you prayed about it and I'm obviously the president was receptive ... have been a little bit about that\n... had a dream about praying for President Trump a and specifically praying or words of Isaiah where a police spirit by eleven\nAnd and her dream she uh she felt like there was resistance to that she had the press through that that it was an important thing to do\nSo she determined that if there was an opportunity to any point she met the president to pray these versus over him and when we learned that we would be going to the house the White House we prayed together and we ask God to give us the opportunity to pray for the president\nWe believe in prayer we believe also and and partition that as we pray for people got can\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on and so we we ask God to give us an opportunity when we asked the president and if we pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the pastor Bronx ideally\nI encountered in Dr ... because of all that's why I'm a member of the the L K they care about one individual and they care about is that the whole world\nAnd pass to burn burn my question is pitching field prayers people around the world prank Cleveland concern it's hard to lift up her friend Corey\nOK so first I Want to tell you something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal ah ah the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it's an irrational think perhaps\nBut when one one that's isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak and so\nAt I look back uh on my second year one God was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much\nBut ah I I Know very well that it was a ... of God's people that was a there with a grace coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace\nAnd I wasn't aware of it at that time but then I I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and they were those times we we've had other cases during where people say the exactly the thing was they feel even though it's irrational they know it's a rational need those situations there can be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more than Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nIt's a critical time more nations in the world\nSo many challenges facing our country we're going to be American Center for launch has never been more and more of them\nWere engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom and\nYou can become a member of the ... sign up right now we don't\nCame out here but we're went up and I should I mean even three weeks ago I said some months ago I guess I said something about that we were encouraging the winter and they said and I think one of the reporters one of the magazine financial magazines maybe and CNBC I'm not sure said a secular made the statement and the lira came up select sleep which was absurd in one sense\nBut it tells you how tied into the geopolitical do people donors this was a NATO ally ... almost made it more\nComplex right and it didn't make it more complex I want people to also realize that we never had an minister ancient engaged like that so bad precedent it worse I think being quick it's because we had an inspiration State Department as Congress fully understand\nIf president that was going against and paying to send it to the house right\nYeah I mean on the human ... I was gonna say the single biggest reason that this case ended in a positive manner and a quick reason is because of the most powerful nation in the world spoke with one voice in of course\nThat was under the leadership of President Trump it authorized the vice president the secretary of state down the administrator of the executive branch or to do so but Jay then you look at the impact in the United States Senate very bipartisan very biking ... Jean Jean from New Hampshire who doesn't agree with the president on a lot of things one of the most vocal in the United\nStates and it looked like a free pass it runs in and and the staff was very helpful to let's go ahead and take another call passive back Julie's calling from Washington state on line to Julie welcome to Jay sexual live you're talking to pass the rents are Julie go ahead\nOh praise the lord has standards and um then praying to song the beginning of\nThe ear plug in your hand in there and has some gratifying\nFinding encouraging and I'm Wondering about the uh missionary about to go in there that are in their own why even say to 'em about that and what about the people that you are listening to them then how can we continue to pray for them those people that you may be spoken to their lives\nFar he was just a witness to I think he's still very much God Bless you\nFor your call Julie so it's a good question pastor one is advice for those that are there and and also those that are left behind that that you minister to\nVote one reality for people who are going at the missions and I but not just for missions I think are increasingly here in the states is it there is going to be a price to pay\nTo stand for truth and ah it's actually something very normal and the Bible is through that that we can expect opposition and that there will be persecution\nAnd so it's not just for missionaries but for people in the states as well as they stand for God and that society they're going to be people who will ah persecute a four\nFoot with the second part of the questions\nThat you want to know what are those that are are still there doing missionary work or what advice would you have for them\nAnd K\nType I think here's here's here's what you really trying to get to their armed people there in Turkey right now that we know are sharing the gospel we know that you were arrested for sharing the gospel you were charged with crushes them when we got an indictment and read it and it said Christians Asian as a form of terrorism we we all say that was absurd\nBut newer people you were measuring too that were impacted by your ministry and turkey are their shepherd to take care of them they're\nOkay yes and are are part of a yes\nOr how how do we also are pray for people who who\nYou know this ah right now there is increasing as long as they said that in the country and ah there we're seeing something very interesting that wasn't happening two years ago is now there are many people coming into the church and saying I Am no longer wanting to be some time now at this\nSo I'm believe in God but I don't I I Want to know how do I find him so I think there are increasing numbers of people and that's just something that God is going to use difficulties in the country I think that\nAre in the ... and and this time I had as as they become more difficult for the church in Turkey a effort people in general that more and more people will turn away from Islam and we'll begin to turn a blow to look for ... you know\nLet's go ahead more questions Brian calling from Arizona on line for Ryan welcome to the broadcast you're talking to pastor Brunson I ride\nA yes thank you thank you so much and a pastor Brunson that prayer was just so humble and symbols which made it so powerful um when you do that with the president is my question um you you brought the Holy Spirit up and I was just wondering you know when Jesus\nLeft he said I leave you an advocate you were not an orphan and I'm sure that that uh you felt like in orphans\nAt times during that a jail sentence and I was just wondering where one of the bigger doubts that transform a weakness to his strengths using this spirit that was a revelation for you in a crisis\nWell I I you know at some point I'm going to write a book and I go into this because they're actually complicated questions\nBut I questioned ah God's personal love for me faithfulness\nUh why he would leave me in a situation like this when I Love him and have dedicated to serving him and and these are questions at the heart\nMore than the mind sometimes just from the emotions and I found that I had to declare the truth and so I wrote a song in prison and one of the lines of Jesus the faithful one who loves me always good and true so that was a declaration of the things that I was doubting\nAnd I determined it doesn't matter what I feel or what my doubts are I Am going to speak the truth about gods character and that's just part of the some of the victories that I had step by step and ... and restoring strength to me was a declaring truth declaring God's character\nLet's go ahead and take John's call and when I think we can get this done before the break hey John calling from Minnesota you're on the air with ...
