on the release a pastor Andrew Brunson\nWashington\nTurks question here\nWas one of the very surreal thing\nWhy not you know and people were not\nAnd certainly enough security officer for a number of years the fence around\nOf people in many countries we're paying for it and even though\nJust cause a lot of her\nThis causes a lot of hurts\nI think that God is using that was planning to to bring blessing to therapy now there are millions of people\nThis tremendous\nRelationship which can be inflated relationship that\nWe especially want to thank goodness trips and really\nOf took off I Know that you can\nWas are engaged in some of\n\nAnd broadcast every one I thought we'd take this Friday to recapture a busy week but I Want to recap our conversation that\nWe had with pastor Andrew Brunson was the first long form interview he gave upon his release from captivity and turkey initially to jail but in house arrest came back to the United states this past weekend was with the president on Sunday we had him on the air on Tuesday\nAnd we had the chance to really talk to him about what is taking place and I thought a is really important for you to listen again to what he had to say now we've seen done a number of media interviews you heard of some of these in the open uh today's the number of interview since then but I think the bachelor and what he said he's going to do is he's going to go take a couple of months off he's going to write\nA that wants to be deployed back on the mission field that's what he said he's calling has been his entire life to preach the gospel and that's what he's going to continue to do but I thought it would be very appropriate for us to reflect on the fact that this releases happen we'll hear from the pastor again but I understand the nature in scope of the work that went into this\nWe had both are legal efforts and that meant that the lawyers led by cc how our senior counsel was running that case for us uh she was in contact with the Turkish council during the entire process multiple court hearings up four days a trial over about five month period\nAnd you know that story but we also had the diplomatic effort of all this going on we were made multiple appearances at the United nations at the human rights council the U.N General assembly\nSo we engaged on a whole host of levels the the UN's a commission or an arbitrary detention took up pastor Brunson case in fact even though he's released were still responding to their inquiries because the Turks were glad they did this I think it was positive id will help us turkey relationship without question\nBut you can't ignore the fact that this was a terrible abuse that took place against a Christian pastor who's only crime was quote Christian nation which the Turks under their criminal system viewed as a crime\nThat that's what it was we remember we translated the word and it said Christian ... so I say all that\nTo let you know I thought it would be important as we end the week to recap where we were and where we come from on this case and to hear again from pastor Brunson a call your friends to listen in on this I think I think it's really important you hear the words especially now that some time has gone on because look this is what happens with these cases they're out\nThey come out there is a neutral flurry of news coverage and then it goes quiet as a pastor and his wife and family returned to light back in the United states in her wedding for their next assignment and taking some time for freshmen and relaxation which they need\nBut again I Want to thank you all are members of the American Center for Law Justice for helping us make this case happened here supported the ACL Jay allows us to do exactly what we did here and I also want to thank our friends in the media\nMany of you better listen to this broadcast shopper political information as a member media friends listen in every day as well but I Want to thank you for covering the case in these cases often so important to keep the individual that's held in captivity in the news\nBecause job one is to keep them alive job to or jump job one a is get them all but you got to keep them alive per se and I want to think a lot of our friends in the media I I if I started given a list I end up leaving people that I don't want to do that\nFor helping covered this case I talk to them about a lot of other issues during the week but what able to talk about this when I appreciate that and the end result was very very good let's come back after the break we're

to uh go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting we're of all that several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years when there was a surge of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAnd he's the OJ member today it's easy to go online and sign up you know Jay on\n\nWe're joined by pastor Andrew Brunson were throw that happened the first time we've had him on a\nRadio broadcast obviously just out of a turkey and we're glad that he's home in the United states having said that I Know pastor your heart though is for the most for the people of turkey and I'm sure that has not changed\nBut no we we still love turkey got ... years ago and we are expecting that there will be a great artist in Turkey\nNow so we'll be talking about the first year you said you were broken in January we covered ear extensively you had a ... you were in a jail with twenty two people that was originally designed for eight a you had very harsh conditions are talking about the second year\nYeah so the first year of feel like I was broken down and a shattered again and again and then the second year that's when I feel that God began to rebuild me and a lot of that happened uh just what small victories\nA big uh declaring truth declaring that God is with me uh I think of as a fifty ten became averse for me where a one were walking in the dark wait hold on to our God so I felt that I was walking in the dark and uh\nIt was a time when I began to rebuild missile I wrote a song or I'm declaring as love for me and his faithfulness and especially focusing on the idea of endearing till the end and uh being faithful and that\nWell you certainly have been and and that's great see see I Know that we I remember in this very studio\nWhen we were first talking about those conditions are in the prison how cold it was a the number of people it was the people that this is under a bridge in anywhere is not great but you can imagine in a country like turkey or it's these are pretty awful conditions\nYeah it was very you know terrible conditions and you know I was able to talk to Noreen\nAnd during the legal process you not to give hope through what steps are of course we didn't know what ... what are you a chance of Christian trying to get help killings and even when you're down the ... we have now the gods and now he's working in saying now that that was a hard process and when you're in a Turkish printing to see what's the dead and that's where the help and I\nSaw a net on Facebook says your testimonies incredible God Bless you pastor Brunson you want to go\nYeah I I was going to ask a pastor Brunson a question about the people he was in prison when he's talking about on ABC News\nBut the idea that it with some really rough people considering that you were so high profile\nI always wanted to underscore that to our us audience how high profile you weren't turkey like you said when the economy went bad when the two officials were saying should they blamed Andrew Brunson in Turkey a ... they made you have to be this kind of super spy in the Turkish media\nAnd then you get put into jail cells with people a predominantly Muslim or who have read a ... pretty salacious things about you\nWell what happened is that\nUh at the beginning I wasn't high profile and they treated me they treated all of the other people are accused of being part of the coup attempt and being a part of the gay line that's movement what say\nIs basically an Islamic movement and so at the beginning of the difficulty I never complained about the physical conditions I was at it or whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything\nPaul conditions I was in a whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was in prison [laughter] definitely and\nThe truth is it a lot of the people I was in prison with a war accused of being part of the last moment and there are police officers or military or\nA ... there were just very strong Muslims and the most difficult thing for me but during that time with the spiritual environment because they were all very committed\nVery strong listen so there were constant prayers going on recitation of the Koran that was like a Muslim house of prayer twenty four seven uh and I was only Christian and I had no fellowship or\nAnyone to pray with so the the spiritual environment was difficult as I became more ... higher profile after President Trump asked for me at the summit that he hadn't made two thousand Seventeen then I'm within a couple of months they moved me from that sell\nTo a maximum to a higher security prison that I had been in a and put me in a smaller so with with just a two other people and the reason they did that was to provide more security so that people would not hurt me in any way so nothing what happened\nRight let's go right to the phones were holding on to talk to your pastor Brunson Laura in North Carolina online find Laura welcome to Jay you'll live\nThank you I Want to thank you I really do care it's you know um [noise] and\nThank you for what you what you are you know I'm so glad that back I mean they're praying for you than we\n... we saw that come up by what sign the thing on line that that petition online and was not ... you know\nIncredible ... a nail down and praying for with uh our president\nYou let me ask you about that let me ask you about that one uh Andrew that was on quite a moment I mean I'm I've been in that room on on many occasions but that was certainly a different one what was your sense of that I mean I Know you wanted to do it you write about it and I'm obviously the president was receptive but tells me a little bit about that\n... had a dream about praying for President Trump\nA and specifically praying or words of Isaiah ... Holy Spirit eleven\nAnd and her dream she uh she felt like there was resistance to that she had the press through so that it was an important thing to do so she determined that if there was an opportunity to any point if she met the president to pray these versus over him\nAnd when we learned that we would be going to the White House we prayed together and we ask God to give us the opportunity to pray for the president\nWe believe in prayer we believe also and and partition that as we pray for people God can a pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on\nAnd so we we ask God to give it set up or today when we asked the president if we could pray for him he was very receptive and it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Brunson ideally\nI encountered in tough to come because of all that's why I don't remember the hail today because they care about one individual and they care about us and said that the whole world\nAnd pass to burn turn my question is did you feel a prayer people around the world prank Cleveland Princeton and it's hard to tell their shrimp Corey\nOK so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how to see a would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us\nThe hearings and then the next day goes through a whole day at work and just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh\nUh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it set a rational thing perhaps\nBut when one one that's isolated the way I was is it would be forgotten and that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak and so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much but uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a great it's coming to me that often was not felt it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I I Would look back and say well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right and we're taking a break we'll come back with ... pass arrange runs the moment but interesting statement\nWhen you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases during where people say the exactly the same they feel even though it's irrational kind of know into rational in those situations there can be completely forgot\nI Will be back with more than Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nShe's a critical time more nations in the world\nSo many challenges facing our country we're going to be American Center for launch has never been more and more money\nAt the seals were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nMember and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou become a member of the the OJ lawn lawn sign up right now we see on\nCame out here but we're went up and I I mean even three weeks ago I said over a month ago I guess I said something about that we were encouraging the later and they said and I think one of the reporters one of the magazine financial magazines maybe CNBC I'm not sure said a secular made the statement and the lira came up select sleep which was absurd in one sense\nBut it tells you how tied into the geopolitical do people don't and this was a NATO ally ... almost made it more\nComplex rain and it didn't make it more complex I want people can't also realize that we've never had a minister rationing dates like past precedent it worse I think being quick it because we had an inspiration State Department as Congress fully understand\nIf president was bleeding against and paying to send it to the house right\nYeah I mean on a human planes yeah I was gonna say the single biggest reason that this case ended in a positive manner and a quick reason is because of the most powerful nation in the world spoke with one voice in of course that was under the leadership of President Trump did authorize the vice president the secretary of state down the administrator of the executive branch\nOr to do so but Jay then you look at the impact in the United States Senate very bipartisan vary by ...
