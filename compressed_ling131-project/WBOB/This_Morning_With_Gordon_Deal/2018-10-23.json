the president or gave an address to the United nations uh that focused primarily on a Iran as far as Tara point goes and it was very specific\nWith Iran also are talking about um the situation with Korea I Want to start with Korea we can I'll just for a moment because I Want to just a position last year this was the president about North Korea at the United nations\nRocket man is on a suicide mission for himself\nAnd for his regime the United states is ready willing and able to hopefully this will not be necessary that swat the United nations is all about that's why the United nations is more\nLet's see how they do\nSo that was a statement very strong very direct gotta lotta we've got a lot of news on that one when he did it this year one year later twelve months later when it came to North Korea take a listen\nI Would like to thank chairman Kim for his courage and or the ...\nSo much more remains will be\nSanctions will stay in place on a ...\nIs so here's what you got in the course of twelve months that went from rocket man and what he was doing to aid ongoing just 'cause what you read\nOf that I think we did was why the world has to continue to take America as seriously as the world superpower that within one year\nWe have the ability if we choose to diplomatically engaged country like North Korea which is so isolated and completely change the relationship at least for now\nAnd we can use tough rhetoric we could use rocket man type rhetoric one year before and then a year later a there's already been a summit in between so it's not like this upcoming in between that year of using that kind of tough language basically any world leaders including the Iranians they want to meet with the U.S leader is the ... the leader of the free world\nRegardless of who hold that office just it's the leader of the free world and I think they see from our president that side of the strikes\nThat that that ability to take the lead and so because of that uh I think it was again it just shows you the strength of America what Donald Trump has tried to portray again as as a country\nThat we can take a stand in the world and the countries will come to us so ... so here so I I read the very similar I think that I'm going to get his opinion on this I think what you have is the president had strong\nRhetoric strong talk that's the way you can do deals with his diplomacy puts it on the line he speaks as he is thinking about it in the way in which he is he articulate it\nAnd then but he is he's very calculating and very smart and the way it's handled so that you can go into a twelve month period Harry from Little Rock admitting called Little Rock them in their rocket meant to chairman Kim\nAbsolutely so if you look at the north Korean experience it suggests that President Trump's policy\nOf remaining term and confronting threat directly in other words his maximum pressure approach produces results [noise] and that is good for the United states\nSo quickly

calls on this one hundred\nSixty four thirty one town I showed you the differential Betty made regarding Korea North Korea specifically a but he also set a theme not only was it a about these dictators but it was also about America's role in the world that's point number twenty to\nAmerica will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance\nControl and domination by honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs beliefs and traditions the United states will not tell you\nHow to live or work\nWe only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return [noise]\nSo how do you how do you read that one area I mean what I sense and again we'll take your calls an eight hundred sixty four thirty what is it the president is still making it clear that we're not leading from behind but that we're not engaging in every global conflict\nAbsolutely so one of the things that the president emphasized in his speech is that the rest of the world has to respect us sovereignty us in ... the president of the United states is put\nSovereign teach us in ... the president of the United states is putting American citizens increased first rather than be interest of global elites and that is true in a number of arenas including\nA international trade and dealing for instance with Iran and the Iranian move us he is not prepared to continue to send cash to Iran he withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and he is\nHas imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime new sanctions take effect a new November the fifth or twenty Eighteen\nAnd this is placing pressure on the Iranian leaders and the European global us who continue to attempt to prop up the Iranian regime encountered distinction to supporting the Iranian people\nYou know what's interesting about that is it there are reports that the Europeans are meeting to try to figure out ways around the sanctions because they know that if they got to make a choice between doing business with the United states are doing business with the Iranians it's very easy\nChoice right now and it's it's pretty general but that that he was going to put together some vehicle they're calling it a that all the funds would flow through that would somehow a take these cut make these companies immune from us sanctions because most of them would also do business\nHave some financial traction transactions of the U.S because our banking system be so important our stock market\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL gene member today it's easy to do is go on line who signed the OJ daughter\nMusic who's that ban\nWe're taking your calls at eight hundred and sixty four thirty went to any reaction to president speechless go ahead and pick up on called dirty outright suppose we don't want to a hundred and six eight four thirty one ten let's go I I think we'll start with the joy in Alabama a live tree joy welcome to Jay ... how do we go ahead\n[noise] when they say that let's say the president's stage\nKissed as a\nPart of an ... a ... a ... ... ... the show\nUp and they paid ... they had I Can't say whether that Cadillac ... either can't trace their leaders\nWhat I heard him say the\n... all the people that we should all\nBe like a nation that we should be proud of our cultures [noise] and that we should be able to live our lives and I liked that have to ... ... bad or or they're worse or you\nKnow it's there were the sovereignty of the various countries and but he also at the same time he said that any any meant that I think that's a good strategy and a good policy but he also put an on notice Syria\nThat if you use cat let's get this out and buy ready so he while he want to respect sovereignty and wanted to understand that we're not going to be stuck by all dog Muslim failed policies when it came down to Syria and red lines and chemical weapons is president was\nUnapologetic in the way in which he put that forward so when you look at that you look at what he said about Syria or in that context it was it was very direct let's go ahead and take a listen\nThe ongoing tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking\nOur share and also\nThe the escalation of military conflict along with a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people in this man he urged the United nations led peace process\nRest assured the United states will respond it's chemical weapons are deployed\nBy the Assad regime\nSo the red line is chemical weapons he's already taken action when it happened in the past but he also said the will of the people of Syria to be fulfilled\nYeah so I think that that is to make sure that they had representation that is not Iranian mullah lead\nThat is that are not necessarily the Assad regime\nThat the U.S we know this is one of the most complicated a conflicts are going right now the world are we have basically eliminate I think is the prejudice at eighty five percent of ISIS a so ISIS is playing a less import a poor rural but that vacuum has been filled by others like Iran and Russia are who are backing strongly the Assad regime\nHow can you get to actual peace and prosperity and ate it back to even as a series that can be rebuilt\nWhile that is ongoing no you cannot I mean there are still massive civil war ... a destruction of entire towns cities not just villages by the way cities a major infrastructure completely wiped out\nThat's just villages by the way cities a major infrastructure completely wiped out so I think it's a long term strategy that has to look at what our interest and the to the interests of the Syrian people but be cautious would you do that\nBecause right now I mean there are still a lot of factions there even outside the Assad regime that are dangerous I'm going to the second it\nProbably want to get into this globalism issue a little bit more but Harry what was your reaction to the president on the Syria issue he ... his entire speech the much respect sovereignty but he clearly laid down a marker with as it relates to Syria that a nother utilization of chemical weapons will be met with action\nAbsolutely so it's clear that the use of chemical weapons is a violation\nOf international law\nBut equally clear the president is emphasizing something that the prior administration could not and that is the president is a man of his word this sends a clear an unmistakable message to both our enemies and allies alike\nSo that there are clear red lines going forward I think Jordan is absolutely correct the Syrian situation is very very complex with Iran with Russia\nAnd other groups involved in Syria a but it's also important that we send a message to Syria that we send a message to Russia or that there are red lines that is helpful in protecting a one of our allies\nIsrael going forward so I think the president again has emphasized that he's a man of his word and that's very very important going forward\nSo right back to the phones surely in Florida on line to surely welcome to Jay sexual alive I surely you're on the air\n[noise] All right great cat can't\nMake less than ... ...\n... I mean standing may well that can kind of a well step get ... get quite will keep peace plan on\nHow I I really disappointed I never hear both China or Russia and support a lot that's why we\nNow we're going to get me and it was it was muted response on China and Russia because there's the bilateral trial I don't want to go ... going on here uh and I think that for the ... when you have the only forty minutes to speak so I think the president about forty minutes that is ... there's only so much you can cover ... but that doesn't mean there's not meetings going on\nBut it's not so much what they say than it is also what these countries actually do\nWell and it's also what we do behind the scenes as well ... I mean look the president has been very consistent with this call not only for contributions to the UN but also contributions to other programs and let me just give one small example there is a program called the un development program which is supposed to support\nSomething that Jordan was talking about the resettlement of refugees who have been displaced by ISIS and others\nAre Jay this administration has told the rest of the world I'm pulling back a big contribution to the United states is making that program because you all are supporting it as you should and guess what I'm going to do I'm going to send it directly to the Christian ... as you use the communities that have been displaced by this\nThat is the way he has backed up the words he gave today Jay with action on the ground so as it relates to China if they don't come to the table and contribute in any like fashion the president will just keep pulling the United states dollars back and allocating indirectly\nWhen we come back from the break I Want to get into the issue of the international criminal court the president mentioned that and I've appeared there I Know that one uh so this is we're able to talk to you about a lot of these issues\nAnd said I I had the privilege of being at that podium at the general assembly I've been here before the office of the prosecutor the ah UN at the international criminal court in the Hague are presenting Israel's interests before the I. C. C. so I've done this\nOr we're going to talk about that we're talking about the president's comments in globalism and take more of your phone call one eight hundred sixty four three one wondering that's eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten it was interesting that the president had been statement the Iranian people again just this is drawing a distinction between the Iranian regime\nAnd the Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran's treasury let me play for you sound bite thirty one\nYear right in people are rightly outraged\nThey're leaders have embezzled millions of dollars from Iran stretch [noise]\nSees that he ... the\nLooted and people's religious and down and it's\nAll over the line there on a good sense and they are promising to wage war\nNot on\nThat is from the president the United states speaking at the United nations strong words on the Iranian\nRegime that we've got thirty more minutes ahead of this broke as if you don't get the full hour discovered ACL J died or were screaming at their course on Facebook at Facebook dot com slash secular were periscope you could run it but you can get it there as well and we encourage you to that question a lot of states now carry the full hour for those of you that are going to be staying with us we've got um coming up\nI really want to get into this issue of globalization issue the whole international criminal court and all that plays into this and we're taking your calls at one eight hundred six eight ... thirty one tent don't forget to work at an ACL Jay you do that at a C. O. J. down or back with more in just a moment [noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country you were going to be American Center for lunch on has never been more and more on\nThe ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now I see how old's your daughter\nBut the president also rejected the I. C. C. the international criminal court jurisdiction now there are a couple of lawyers\nIn the world that have appeared before the ice you see I mean I Love this when we get criticized what are the the secular with his team no about international law ... law droplets well at least for back to those lawyers how many of you have appeared before the office of the prosecutor multiple occasions by the way at the international criminal court and Meg because Jordan I have\nWith the team and we've been there here's what the president said about the icy say\nAs far as America is concerned the icy she has no jurisdiction [noise]\nNo legitimacy\nSee I see the flames near universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country\nViolating all symbols of justice fairness and due process we will never surrender American sovereignty to an unelected unaccountable level\nIraq or is this this is very very important I Want you to put in context rejects the icy sees universal jurisdiction which is a position we have advocated\nI'm violating it principles of justice new process I've seen those hearings we will by the way we were successful in orthodoxy no series you've seen those hearings this is not due process that we we understand or expect in here and we're not going to surrender our sovereignty to a group of world judges that is what that is\nWe have the greatest legal system in the world I think the most fair with the most uh due process presented because it's constitutionally guaranteed to the people this is a U.S honestly a system where\nIf you were to allow the Obama administration was a ... getting there that fully there but certainly not attacking the ice you see\nA this court to run a have any kind of jurisdiction over the United states or allies it would cause ... it would just be serious trouble you'd be letting the world try our soldiers try Americans um it ... whenever they they disagreed with our foreign policy decisions\nAnd so whatever the purpose is we're behind the creation of the icy see like most international institutions that these they serve a much better purpose at at temporary I think what you have a war crimes tribunal for specific event that occurred or genocide that occurred that can be successful and you could back something like that\nSo what ... what we saw a specifically that's where the international treaty has been successful going back to a again at Disney World war two at following World War two specific tribunals for specific events this general kind of jurisdiction\nTo criminalize whatever they feel like criminalizing first of all has been horrible for developing nations where they really focused on up because the superpowers have been able to ignore them mad at me that is that Russia's not involve the U.S not involved\nUm Israel's not bald basically the countries that do support it they support for political purposes yeah sorry what was your\nWhat is your when the president talks about the the global jurisdiction globalism generally and the lack of the United states willing to engage that I think that as a positive\nThat's very very important it's important to note that many global is including US state department officials are often apologist for the United states and for American values and America's role in the world\nThey are prepared to downgrade American interests and to elevate the grievances of other countries President Trump rightly rejects this approach\nBy doing so he advances justice and due process and the rule of law the United states then becomes a beacon\n... ... a role model for the rest of the world so emphasizing us sovereignty I think it's very very important or let's go ahead and take a call one eight hundred and\nSixty four thirty one tent who's next yep Eric ... New Mexico on line for Eric welcome to Jay Sekulow live fire\nSort of take a minute to do what they see All right thank you I just want to make a call I mean it's it's it's about it\nSo that they talked about that earlier and that the the stark contrast between the two how do you ... that was an interesting call Eric I'm well how do you see that I mean there was clearly defined task here of three things he's kind of take white America First\nWe are going to insist on human rights that we're not going to a third you know other countries have their people gassed or chemical weapons being utilized that kind of a line that this president seems to engage on that doesn't want to get into internal squabbles doesn't want to get into internal civil wars but it's not going to sit by while people are gassed\nA buck and chemical weapons by by dictators and the third thing you saw him when he mentioned the ... you know it's interesting because he mentions the\nUm he does not want unelected unaccountable\nUm global bureaucrats engaged is now I wrote a book called on Democrats that had the which the title was unelected bureaucrats unaccountable bureaucrats or that kind of run roughshod on me and you could take that to a global scale as well and you see at first because you've been to the\nUn well when you made those comments did the first thing that came to mind was your book because that was one of the reasons I Know that motivated you to ride it as the actions that we saw in the United nations and we did not want our bureaucracy to follow suit but you know it is a hundred and eighty degrees from the foreign policy at the last ... I think\nIt or that policy was fair to describe is one of appeasement where now it's a policy of strength it's not metal lean but it's American leadership through strength\nAnd the other thing that struck me I think when the American president took the lectern in many administrations in the past the rest of the world didn't pay that much attention because they didn't think there would be followed through\nBut this president whether it's the Jerusalem embassy or rude and removing the United states from ... or or withdrawing from the Iran deal or or pulling back Palestinian funds\nJay he has told the world in advance what he will do and then what has he done he's followed through so to Jordan's point about anticipating the American president speech I think more than ever before because those in that chamber know the words that come out of his mouth\nYou think more than ever before because those in that chamber know the words that come out of his mouth are going to be followed up by actions\nYeah the tariffs that renegotiate trade the other say should I mean uh the targeted sanctions the end of ah the the the more a widespread sanctions the upcoming sanctions on Iran that kick in\nUh how we have treated judge China but at the same time the trade deal we decide with South Korea\nOr that increased a lot of things that was a big surprise was that the increased us or auto\nExports into South Korea that was not necessarily something that a lot of experts thought it was on the table even the up and it was more focused on farm and kind of the foods and things like that\nUm and it said also included at a doubling of the number of us cars that can go per manufacture into the the South Korean economy show a there are positives steps that they've taken a a renegotiating trade deals\nAnd then there are the the again approaches that you take a the punishments\nAnd if you see the tariffs on China are fighting to get China to the table\nThese are real these are happening as we speak it is not a threat to when the president speaks about stuff that he is considering [noise] he has a record now\nOf what he said that acting on [noise]\nSo now everyone knows that these words he uses it the un yeah our our our action items that will be acted\nOn it and and the wind you saw that with the with the Kim Jong un statement the beginning and then from last year than where we are today you saw that with\nIsrael and then moved on the Capitol Jerusalem [noise]\nAll of that is very very real\nHigh last segment we take your calls on any topic one eight hundred six eight for thirty eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero we're going to be back more with your calls lined a gym right now but I can guarantee you that are going to open up one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten\nIt's a historic move now the United states is December seem Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf Israel and his very right to exist a lynchpin issues not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS among the law in Iran all pledged in white plains Rio from the severe in his new book New York times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation Jerusalem\nMiddle school and historical pays for the Jewish capital present clear irrefutable evidence\nTo remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist in the book do spells legal miss reported by Israel's\nHere's your topic today Jerusalem a biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born [noise]\nBeen or a mission for nearly Thirty years\nAt the American Center for law and justice who are dedicated to protect your religious constitutional for you because of the many ... members who stand with us we've seen great success over the years as we engage in legal legislative cultural issues that matter most to you and your family\nSeal Jay is on the front line when it comes to protecting your freedom sending Christians and they're saying this country and abroad\nStanding up for human life battling abortion working to cut off taxpayer funding Planned Parenthood there's not a matter of time for you to join the American Center for one justice standing with us you can make a tremendous difference in our country hand or culture", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "23"}
