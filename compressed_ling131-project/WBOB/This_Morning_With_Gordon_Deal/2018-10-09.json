I think it took about thirty seconds after the Republicans delivered that fit the vote and Susan Collins speech that Joe mansion said he was also a yesterday it was essentially J uh fifty one to forty nine margin\nIs going to and I think it's important actually I think this is a good call the tickets were while we're talking about this margin gym in New Hampshire as a direct question on line three Jim welcome to Jay Sekulow alive Jim\nI Am\nSo we still like to ski vote present\nAlright so let's talk about that go ahead oh what happened was one of her ... Republican colleagues Steve Danes who voted yes on culture and Murkowski voted no on cloture announce that she would be a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh uh her Republican colleagues Steve Danes was a yes vote\nAnd would have a bit of a yes vote on Kavanaugh his daughter was getting married and he's from Montana as senator from Montana on that Saturday if he had to he ... he was going to fly back\nTo vote a but out of a out of just a niceties there she knew that their votes would cancel each other out anyway so it would affect the nomination so she could vote present so she was still registering her opposition uh didn't but that is why she did not vote no she would have voted no Steve days was there\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today it's easy to do just go\nOnline and sign up and LBJ\nBy the\nWay a little bit of a programming note for you tomorrow on the broadcast [noise] we're going to have a special report\nOn a C a bb this is the case involving a Christian Woman who's been sentenced to death\nIn Pakistan or for sharing her pay they accused her of blasphemy case she's been in jail for eight years she's a mother we'd been heavily involved in our case where her case we have an office in Pakistan has been involved directly in the case\nAnd um I Will tell you how heated it's become when we sent out a request for people to pray about a pray for her and her family and the lawyers are handling the case I I did this over the weekend because the hearing was today um that we started this we saw all of a sudden\nI'm moving the technical term I guess it just is what it just the people that were writing really horrible things about us to see a baby we were saying pray for people were say\nFor ... hang let's see it'd be but\nYeah I mean there's multiple in English is hashtags Israeli through and it's it was just smoking in Pakistan as well but um it's a again to anything positive about a sea of baby so I wouldn't be enough you\nTweak things out and ... with your Twitter account that but it's happening worldwide not just to our Twitter out I'm at this call for what section of should we be allowed to do it under a as we said this is the death penalty case\nAnd uh that these are Pakistan primarily or a Muslim Pakistanis who are calling for her to be executed ... so its hang her executed or kill her publisher\nAnd a and again this makes it so a dangerous for the judiciary there they've judges have died in the past that the court as well as other cabinet members who have expressed support for ... years now but in prison or eight years so difficult\nTo you I mean I'm going well we'll we'll do this in the moment but we'll get back to the top of a bond that she became just for a moment here this was I this is the hearing this was the hearing ... yeah so we thought because we talked to sharia are Gail from our office right he said this is it I mean this\nIs yeah it's just that they accept the verdict and there is no timeline on that\nMost cases in Pakistan even the Supreme Court so very unlike ours\nAt the highest court their language this three judge panel or the chief justice did sit on this one we know that um that's a pretty ... Ninety percent come\nThat day you know like the burning it would be right in this in an important cases so the other ten percent they do take time but I don't it's not usually the time like here where it could be months and months and months from our Supreme Court\nThis this could happen at any moment there's probably a lot of security concerns that risk here there's geopolitical issues at risk here um and I get nervous because of what these judges face so I'm a what we saw before as is even like you get to this point and judges start leaving so you don't have a core um so you can't have a verdict\nYou got to go through it again I get nervous about all of that because you know they're under sound like you're hearing went very well the hearings have gone well for her is that the judges have either been killed or have quit\nAnd ah and again that's ... that's a ... give people more and more update on the news comes in you know we're gonna we're going to give you a full ... hour on that tomorrow that big of a case I Would prefer the judge is\nIn that situation I mean that's the ... and even the prosecutors ... the government officials at the police um her attorneys as well of course her family but I Know you're doing that uh but but especially for those judges not not on the decision a but but John uh their safety\nThose judges not none of the decision a but but Don or their safety um even while they're um they're deciding a because what we know the other side that has tried to harass or kill them before they got to a decision point yeah All right\nWe're talking about a lot more about this we're going to be a full briefing on this case a tomato broadcasts let's go ahead and go right back to the phones yep David calling from Tennessee on line one David welcome to Jay Sekulow alive Hi David\nThank you for taking my call okay sure there aren't as you I mean I'm very pleased with our\n... like a witch or the radio and it's a lot there were listening to radio than it was the hero TV you know\nBut now where do we go all the way we've got you know this and we've seen there but once the dishes and cruel it really I use the word evil that they're doing in the labor and Christians that want to stand up and do the right thing how are we supposed to go for it it'd be honorable wait till\nI'm ... you know what we think is like in in in going for\nWell I mean look I Would tell anybody Republican Democrat independent Green Party whatever part of you our boat\nI mean you know I think you have an obligation to vote and vote your conscience and vote the way you you know this issue impacted you one way or another ah you should vote ... ... it's an import look Supreme Court\nIssues are important to voting on that is important to question I guess is and and I appreciate your calling in David for instance in Tennessee you saw Marsha Blackburn number than just kind of sky rocket because they were within a state where the margin of error for for months and then all of a sudden over the last week she pulls up eight points maybe one coming out tomorrow ten or eleven\nThat tells you something is going on\nI I think it speaks directly to a gym was just expressing concern about the O. J. I mean I think you saw two very different ways that you did that the parties would process these nominations and even though Phil Bredesen said he'd vote for breakfast will vote for effort Phil Bredesen Jay is essentially an endorsement of the process that we saw from the Democrats during this\nSo look at how if you want to process that is respect ... process that is focused on a judicial philosophy and qualifications then you need a couple of things one you need a majority in the United States Senate whether you're for the Democrats are for the Republicans\nAnd Jay you need a chairman of the Judiciary Committee any leader of the majority party or they will not allow for some of the uh I Would call shenanigans that went on in this case so you look I think bill British and felt pushed on this and I think the the the uptick in numbers that you've seen for Marsha Blackburn gay I think it is directly related\nTo sort of um I Would call it the circus that we saw here in Washington DC over the last\nCouple of them actually got will heightens our produce point in the south she was actually Marshall backwards actually pulling up ... points down so she's already probably all of them so that when I'm hearing the eleven points wings probably already happened because she ... she was down three so yeah and that is\nHappening in the latest poll so I mean it's really the the the margin of polls still shows her with a smaller margin but if you look at the latest polls and just last week it's swung significantly I mean to you know plus a plus plus well so that again or you watch that closely because a resource battle at this point twenty nine days out\nUm ... you'll see some ads are run directly by the candidates some ads are run by\nA the DNC and its affiliates packs and things like that\nPolitical action committees they will start moving out if there's no chance of of if they're wasting their resources that doesn't mean that the Democrat will continue to run ads because they've got their own resources is in Tennessee they happened to have a personal resources in a pretty well funded campaign but they won't have the onslaught\nOf of not just adds but people on the ground on election day you know coming from the national party if\nThe polling is continues to show pinpoint leads up by a by their their ... Republican opponent when you have that kind of lead um again you've got to move on how do you think this place I mean we got a minute forty four seconds your how big than you think this place in the house\nUm I think it's ultimately be the deciding factor I mean it it will depend on in some of these swing states how many of these Democrat members really really make it an issue but the M I n J just the overall tone nationally I think that I think Mitch McConnell put it right when he says the his opposition really played into\nOr the Republican Party is hands so you're down to thirty or forty competitive seats in the house I think it could be the decision maker\nI worry and talk more about this we come back from the break we'll have our full panel with us as well we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten that's eight hundred sixty four three one two one zero so we'll take some more calls when we come back from the break I think look a Britain you saw\nAll the ... working up to ... a ... of the nation process president's authority and saw the article ... I mean are you in three all impacted\nBy this president the executive legislative with the judicial branch and um there was a multi pays attack\nOn bread cabinet it didn't didn't work this time they couldn't get it they were trying to get it to pay for which would have been there were but not to molten coming out of those investigations to other people saying we need more time and then there was a round the clock out when the FBI did the investigation they cannot cooperate\nAny of the allegations made against judge Kavanaugh and in fact the one that was raised by one of the other lawyers\nLate in the game or a missed wet next I think there were inconsistencies in her own statements that came out so just the evidence wasn't there to to move before and that's what happened and then you saw the vote in the confirmation will be back with more including your calls or just after the break\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the the L G daughter\nAh yeah love that man so look Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are they good to me I'm I'm a I'm a walk away I I was a Democrat my entire life when President Trump announced he was running for president Z I became a Republican\nA simple as that you know a Democrat is all they did with Brett Kavanaugh was prove that they are willing to do anything that it takes to destroy president should be\nI think you might go ahead they are willing they they've been a party always willing to unite and do whatever it takes to to undermine their political opponents more so the Republicans are they are tougher I think that you you see that even when they are the minority party they were on the cusp of\nA of a a really killing a nomination potentially I'm a ... and they were a member there were moments during that where people thought that would be the case that this might be over um they you know they only ... ultimately with all those\nClose races like a Heidi Heitkamp in Claire McCaskill the only per se loss was Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nIs pretty you know that that is pretty United around I mean even on an even or whether there should be a vote\nThey voted no you know Joe Donnelly types voted no on allowing it up or down vote or they voted no a ... so not just on the nomination itself but whether or not there would be a vote on the nomination so you saw a party line basically cloture vote\nTo flip the mansion and Murkowski then again party line again a confirmation vote except for Mitch\nAll right let's step I would've plays by from Senator Kamala Harris because if you think this is over politically I guess again\nThis week [noise] can get\nEnergy that we know we have [noise] ... and then the bottom line is that they have the power\nNow but we need to take it\n[noise] so how do you say and what is your reaction to this is a messaging point going voted by the way we're taking your calls at eight hundred sixty four thirty one time we want your reaction to all this the political ramifications of how it impacts you what it meant to you one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one time go ahead Matt ... matter of well ahead [laughter]\nI got a note from a ... year than it's ever\nGoing to miss it is for Matt too as well I should but I Would agree I think it\nI think it's a trade off from inside the Democratic caucus look yeah I mean come on Harris is from California Cory Booker from New Jersey and this opposition of President Trump at any cost including Brett Kavanaugh might play well for them and their elections and even in house races inside the states but the problem for those to Jay\nIs that it doesn't play well in the states where the majorities in both the house and Senate will play out it's over play in your hand and places like North Dakota Tennessee Missouri Indiana Tennessee in Texas so look\nKamala Harris and Cory Booker who want to run for president Sunday there probably willing to make that trade but I think it costs them an opportunity to take a majority in the house and solidly actually backfires on in there you go ahead\nWas yeah I I think it absolutely does and as they continue to breathe out threats and cursing Z now are saying he's going to invest right Kevin all and in what Kamala Harris ed I'm more and more independent voters Republicans and moderate Democrats there are turned off by this\nWell let me play this is this is Jennifer ... from Fox News who spoke with a house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who hopes to become speaker of the house take a listen\nHow are they will pull this whole question the FBI and that's a little sample cats at all last night quote where for I Am announcing that I Will file at Fordham Law than from a hacker crack heads the ... what can hold the FBI report cats cats have underlying ...\nOr ... for me I found the White House all communication for the FBI from Senate Republicans are in gardening but more\nOf a judge to position here of them wanting the at the request on this particular issue let me just digress for a moment\nAnd they're fighting a release of the guys that are the ... of other ... other investigations other matters let's say that are going on at this time and other matters that are being declassified and not wanting those release but this mess they want released they're going to do a freedom of Information Act request a to get this information\nReally I Would assume that Nancy Pelosi wasn't one of the people that got to read this and other US Senator right but it was not convincing to ... I mean so they don't know if it was a Democrat it'll die from it because there was nothing there so\nIt'd be a report of of saying uh no I'm not in the atmosphere so what does this what does that give different this is just\nTo try and keep it as a political issue that's supposed to fix the house\nLevel or because that you can be more liberal yet they are it's not state wide elections their district elections and and you you take usually are candidates that are that are a little bit more extreme or then when you get to a statewide race\nHarry do you think that the um because you know look they're they're gonna message just point out too I mean they're going to study this are going to focus group but um they there's a risk for Democrats in running on the Kavanaugh's nomination absolutely what it is it can just be too tempting for them but they can't resist\nI think that's correct I think many of the leaders in the Democratic party there are so focused on this particular issue all this means that they will ...\nRefused to focus on issues that are bread and butter issues for\nIndividuals in the middle part of the country many Democrats in my opinion at least disrespect voters who live in so called flyover country a as a land suggested so their tactics may play very very well with voters who are on the east or the west coast\nBut the key question is how will their tactics play out in so called fly over a country and my view is that the approach taken by democratic leaders will indeed backfire\nAnd likely back fire big time or at least if we look at current polling results I think there is a pre Kavanaugh\nHouse race calculus they post Kevin all house race calculus\nIt was so politically charged regardless of what side of the issue you are it was galvanizing and so it shook everything up\nSo what side of the issue you are it was galvanizing\nAnd so it shook everything up nothing politically was the same\nWhen they had the second hearing these accusations if he would've just gone through a which will look likely that either on judicial philosophy kind of normal here he's yes most Democrats voted no but probably a few more would have voted yes um I don't think it would have changed the political calculus so much in fact that the\nPeople like Claire McCaskill would vote yes it may be tougher\nOr to to to to further Republican or how they took to win\nBut instead of instead you had the second round of of of series of all this uncorroborated junk we can now say after the FBI second report\nUncorroborated junk alec get serious criminal allegations against spread capital and everything has changed now so every political calculation must change\nOnce you look at what you have a moment like this in history twenty nine days that we're ... we're talking to you know twenty nine days before the election that was all happening within about a month of the election then what do you think\n[noise] the other reason midterms are historically good for the party that is out of power is because of an enthusiasm gap it's hard to motivate voters who their parties in power to get out to the polls are J I think\nWhat we just saw was about the best infusion of enthusiasm to a party that already has power that you could possibly get so how will play out I don't know but I'll tell you this a Republican majority in the house is far more likely today than it was a month ago I think you're right\nWe're taking your calls coming into the last segment one eight hundred and six eight ... thirty one ten eight hundred sixty four three one what do you remember tomorrow special programming on the case of a C B big developments there we'll talk about that a little bit after the break but we'll get into it tomorrow [noise]\nIt's a
