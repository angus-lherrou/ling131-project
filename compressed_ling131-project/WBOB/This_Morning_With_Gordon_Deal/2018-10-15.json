custody now there's a process says we're on with you live here but I Will call on route to the United states but that route or is going to take a couple of church one he's still in Turkey will be leaving turkey later this evening and then probably\nFlown to a military base in Germany that's probably how it goes and then ultimately to the United states that may come later tonight maybe the next day or two that we kind of what happens once a a pastor and his family are in Germany and in the value waited but\nUh this morning or the trial judge was hearing the case after a couple of witnesses were put forward\nBasically had Andrew Brunson make a statement he did and then ... issued a ruling saying jail for time served time served saving it means here in the United states and that is\nThat he was released a because he already served effectively or three years\nAnd so this way but look folks this was a happy diplomatic effort on a multiple scales\nThe first thing I Want to do is thank you all for all of your prayer or its support for bats the brunt of this family member to the president and and the vice president have done and incredible job here the president is tenacious that's the word that years with Fox News this morning\nAnd advocating for the past or at least a and a music all diplomatic resources available to the United states did that\nAt the end result is that pastor Brunson released also I don't want to ignore members of Congress bipartisan members of Congress purging Israeli so Jordan that I'm going to start or do you would want to talk about that I got a couple of states\nYeah sure I mean I I think it's a huge thing to to the White House President Trump vice president Pence the state department a secretary palm pay over their teams\nThe consulate teams the embassy teams in Turkey and throughout the world who have made this a priority as we saw the president was willing to even sanction Turkish a cabinet officials\nOver pastor Brunson is imprisonment or

visited a with a president Irwin on this issue and a a a with a a pastor Brunson as well so this was a bipartisan effort ultimately you had a the executive branch\nThe legislative branch the United states working together\nTo see pastor Brunson released but I Believe ultimate credit here we're talking about people um it it is the president who made this a priority for his administration to get done\nWell that's exactly are exactly correct and and the situation like this you have to realize that I think we all do that\nTo realize that this was a a team effort but the president did a phenomenal job\nThan also members of Congress were frightened center on this as well\nYeah in the United states spoke with one voice on this and that's why it was so important for the president the vice president to set the tone but in the Congress J I mean scores scores of senators and congressmen spoke out on this uh Jordan you're right I think senators Lankford kill is Shaheen in Graham probably had the most vested interest matrix over to turkey did\nWith officials and the family a ... a bipartisan by camera effort of one of the most impressive I've seen out of the United States

so the president on behalf of all of our ACL Jay member ... family\nAre ... for his unyielding\nUnyielding a efforts to obtain the pastor's release and of course your prayers and support for the past and let me also say there\nAre I have a lot of idea what the media lot as you know a ... in several different capacities outside the seal Jay but I Need to say this to my friends and the media\nThese reporters a for these ah newspapers that when I'm dealing with other matter type of Barry ... in covering pastor Brunson case and the story and that helped keep him alive as part of the process when you got\nBob Burns in this case and the story and that helps keep him alive as part of the process when you got\nPeople held like this and I'm a I'm a huge thank you and I told us to a couple of reporters today I appreciate them covering it and continuing to cover it and uh uh ... that's across the board here uh it's been on many networks of Fox News CNN\nOr at covered extensively ABC News or as covered it I mean I even talked about it with George Stephanopoulos\nOn ABC's This week a couple of weeks back so a good news on that front and we're thrilled with his release but again if you're just joining us ... Bronson now being processed out of turkey and what that means is is that removing the ankle bracelet which was his monitor it was at a house arrest\nIt will be taken to a military transport aircraft\nUh them probably flown indirectly it to Germany or be evaluated the return to the United states I don't know exactly when that mobile will be yet we're ... into that but I'm Will keep everybody posted is this a progressive progressive over the next several hours but a great day\nUh on any time you get these releases like this door and it's a great day we're still waiting\nFor the CBP that case was earlier this week I Know this way way but yeah there there are there were reports morning that back up becoming any moment I'm Out of the package and it was a great day\nGo head out of the Pakistani U.S Supreme court that case here or what happened pastor Brunson\nUltimately was ordered as a unique it's similar in these situations as time served all the witnesses or against fascism Brunson basically dropped their\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL gene member today it's easy to go\nOn line and sign up L. J. dawn\n[noise]\nWhat we did my thoughts and prayers are with pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home soon he tweeted a number of times\nI spoke out publicly a number of times for pastor Andrew Brunson vice president Pence\nA secretary of state ... number of us and there's still is a Lindsey Graham ah a sheen a ... and many more ah lake for ... and other members of Congress I Can't name them All right now uh because again what we're focused on is that pastor Brunson\nAnd American at a Christian pastor who was imprisoned in Turkey for two years are charged with Christian ...\nUm and ultimately fried today in court\nUm after a face after being imprisoned and detained for over a just a little over two years ultimate first let me tell you story yeah he was he was there in Turkey for twenty three years\nAnd it gets picked up I'm back in October of twenty sixteen and he's scheduled to be deported along with his wife so deportation facility then he gets moved to a prison\nBut he doesn't face charges until march of ... Eighteen\nSo from October of twenty sixteen to march at twenty eight and he's just being in prison ultimately four months later in July or after being charged he's allowed to go under house arrest\nNow a lot of that was a positive development but not the end goal obviously\nHere we are now and October um and pastor Brunson\nHas been freed he's been a lot I ordered by the court to uh to have his passport return he can freely or leave the country\nUm ... it's been a order that he's it's time served a so he can leave the country he'll get his passport no longer be under house arrest that could happen it could be leaving turkey as early as this evening and I know the news will be covering that as well I Do want to make it clear to the American civil law and justice we represent\nPastor Brunson and the family and uh and I just want to thank all of you for allowing us to do that your support to the American surf lawn justice is the reason why\nWe can represent the family do this work and uh and let me again I just think the White House the government officials than I Am I'm taking our audience as well and are supporters as well because that's why we're able to engage on Capitol Hill we've got the resources we have the staff\nWe have the information and then all takes support from our listeners support from our members of the American Center for law and justice\nNo question about it Jordan in this instance almost six hundred thousand of our members signed a petition I think the number was five hundred and Ninety nine thousand six hundred and seven\nOf but that is particularly effective in two arenas Jordan first of all and primarily in the halls of Congress to get to their voters who signed the petition by and large\nAnd so when their voters expressed an interest in that case they get engaged certainly it means something to the administration to although I Would tell you that the administration was engaged on this one really before those numbers started piling up the second place\nThe administration was engaged on this one really before those numbers started piling up the second place Jordan where those numbers are so significant is in the international space when we go to the United nations or to the human rights council and can demonstrate that several hundred thousand people around the world\nAre interested in a case and think that there's been a an improper administration of justice as as we thought was the case for ... and\nIt makes the world take notice to Jordan\nReally all of our effort start with that grassroots peace building\nUp their support among grass roots and then it goes to the administration level then it goes to the congressional level and ultimately up to the international community's but all of that door and it comes back to shining a light on these cases in we do that by telling the story and getting people engaged or many of our efforts Jordan would not be nearly as effective without that first piece being in place\nRight folks we are taking your phone calls at one hundred sixty four thirty one twenty a hundred six eight for three one zero Michelle's calling from New York on line for the shell welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nThank you very much I orange chairs\nI'm so happy so happy I heard about this situation this year\nWhen I was going to recovery I've got hurt on my job and I heard about it on the radio and um\nOf course I heard about other people praise echoed TBN and CBS and and just stay here this year what God has died like I've said before and I have not been for God not less what hurt this news today\nI just get God pray for everyone involved it president guess who who ever thought about this particular man and not just them sales but somebody else's family this is what happens when people\nNo matter what they are ethnicities when people get together for the cause look at what God can\nYou know it's exactly right I mean people coming together let's not forget the power of prayer here um which is very important the power speaking out\nA church coming together because that's again and and then taking that into actually taking the face into action Ricci our leaders working with our leaders who are willing to really go to the line go to bat for pastor Brunson President Trump was willing to do it\nVice president Pence secretary Pompeo their teams there stash our embassy teams a consulate teams I ... at the senators the congressmen I mean this is a good folks that shows you there was an all out effort here\nTo see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson from turkey and uh and ultimately ... they they were very tough measures taken against turkey I don't want to focus on those today because today's the day to celebrate uh hopefully\nThis will be something good for uh the relations between the U.S and turkey who our NATO allies I mean ultimately that's that's a big goal here I thought that that kind of bigger picture I even heard\nPastor Brunson a sister talking about that how important of a ally turkey is the United states and that shouldn't have this kind of relationship so that's very important to send her grand was talking about that\nAs well I I just want to underscore to all of you\nAre sinks and how how important it is to stay with it these are tough cases they take us a long time that a ... you try diplomatic options um you can I we had a White House in a president willing to take steps are\nDiplomacy or was not working just to get it done even issue things like us a targeted sanctions\nOn Turkish officials to see the release of pastor Andrew Brunson and I cannot underscored enough um how important it is that all of used to buy for those two years um for pastor Brunson I Know he thanks you\nAdd to his family thanks you and as usual in these situations though he realized because in Turkey it was such a big story\nUm I think he will come to realize even more so over the next twenty four forty eight hours how many people were following his story almost on a daily basis here in the United states and certainly when they were updates on every news network\nA route or many different broadcast shows are some that will be doing later today who ... who stood with this story I Would this American pastor because of his wrongful imprisonment I we've got a second half hour coming up on Jay Sekulow alive\nWritten take your questions your comments one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero we'll see if we can connect to see how it

has never been more and more ...\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ online sign up right now the the L ... daughter\nAll of those names but I Will tell you this back on that initial letter it was co led by the for a chairman and ranking members of the house foreign affairs committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee so that would be Bob Corker Ben Cardin ed Royce and Eliot Engel and why do I\nMentioned that that's a big deal during because when you get both the chairman and the ranking member of those two committees have jurisdiction\nSpeaking with one voice to a to an ally of the United states I mean that can be a very tricky thing uh but those four members came together agreed on a message recruited members of both the house and Senate to join that letter or so so Jordan I Would it would probably be quicker to name those who didn't participate in some level of than those who did but again I Would tell you this\nBy camera all bipartisan speaking in one voice uh in in one voice that was really led by the president they they came behind that message and they agreed with it all\nRight folks as we now take your phone calls one hundred and sixty four thirty one tenet joyous day as you could tell I was we have been a up late working through the night ... sticking with what is happening taking nothing for granted those mover\nAnd still to this moment even when I'm again I think it was Senator Lindsey Graham I totally agree with him as as a one of the attorneys working on this\nFeel a lot better when he is a out of a Turkish airspace I'm In Quetta cannot breathe a sigh of relief because there's a lot of moving parts right now I've seen that before\nBut uh but it is a great day to day to celebrate let's go to the phones one hundred sixty four thirty once in large but hold on line from Kansas on line one Lawrence welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nPie and things are going to be on there I just wanted to drive a broadcast that I think it's amazing what President Trump is doing what vice president parents are now and\nAnd the amazing ... that had been out there and you know having served in the military for quite some time before he retired that turkey can often be a tricky worker can change your mind pretty often and pretty quickly it was very much provocation and\nIt's amazing to see the stance that we've been able to take\nAnd then they're not as important as been out there and what I Want to know is why the owners are not well all the support is out there on the people are focusing and all of the people who are working hard and can we really focused on Asia B.D\nGoing into space in Pakistan that is that is actually at Pakistan's highest court so there may be resolution they're very soon as she is not an American citizen\nWe actually have an office in Pakistan is working on this case directly so uh we are involved it is different when it's not an American citizen a but but I I Would remind you that that the United states government often works on these human rights cases behind the scenes even when it does not involve\nA U.S citizens and so in her matter though it has reached the judges the trial is over after eight years in prison and we're now awaiting a judgment there and we'll be updated from our ... our our staff\nIn Pakistan take a listen to pastor Brunson sister on Fox News this morning I I think it just underscores the importance of all of you who listen to this broadcast to support the worst the ACL Jay who call yourself ACL Jay members take a listen\nI think a lot of times people get bored tend to think wonder why they were\nReally pushing for family really completely without tracing [noise] play hard time defining interest\nI mean that again she says it right there the ACL Jay big driving force and again\nI'm not a ... organization taking all of this credit ... we kind of do is it getting taken to government officials I mean the U.S government had to lead this\nWe set a number of times but you've got to have a group and organizations he ... around you\nThat ... that that has a relationships that can work with those government officials whether that is the executive branch the president the vice president secretary of state State Department\nOf their ... their staff and teams or the legislative branch members of Congress as well saying I mean it's very important it all comes together and you put this driving force starts with meetings it starts with getting the information letting those uh empower\nGet educated about the matter\nUm and uh and then they go to work utilizing their contacts in this case are or many of those that had a ... especially in Congress long term context because turkey is a NATO ally\nYou only when these as a team Jordan and it starts with the six hundred thousand members of the ACL jaded made this a priority for them took their personal time to engage to lend their voice to us\nAnd then we were able to use those voices Jordan you're right to go to the administration and go to bipartisan members of the house and Senate and go to the international community and demand attention on this but I Would say this even with all of that in place Jordan and that's a quite an effort it's quite a a a team effort but even with all of that in place\nWe are not used to getting the response from the apparatus of government that we got the time so I Will say that this administration and the state department deserves a lot of credit in that regard look we've had success with previous administrations inside State Department's on various cases\nBut human rights cases tend to upset the apple courtroom when it comes to issues of priority inside the state department we never encountered that on this case Jordan\nThey were always open to taking this case and find that in fact they took the information from us and then actually took the lead on it from all the way from the White House the president set the tone and gave a directive down through the vice president who is specifically engaged\nOver the course of two secretaries of state down through the state department officials and then back out to a bipartisan members of Congress Jordan I Will tell you this I had never seen a unified voice on a human rights case inside the apparatus in the United states government\nAs I have seen on this one to a team effort and it does start on that grassroots but this administration deserved an awful lot of credit for the way the United states government or behaved enacted aggressively\nNow I encourage folks to share this with your friends and family and the great up there for a great post on ACL Jay dot org about a pastor Brunson ... a pastor Brunson to release detailing the story as well uh people are going to see it throughout the news today will be on\nThe story as well uh people are going to see it throughout the news today will be on some of the broadcast serve some pastor Brunson family already has been on\nBroadcast as well and

of those right now Murray is calling from California on life by Murray welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThinking praise God for this wonderful I happen to work out questionnaires I'm not that it maybe not even according to articles I've read so they can get a pastor Brunson was convicted of aiding terror groups all along I've heard you guys say that he was charged with ... yeah\nI was just wondering what's the difference is just it's just something that turkey came up with it if they could get a charge\nFace I mean it's hard this is your face saving measures we told you this is not normal process or so obviously this was okay but at\nThe highest levels of the Turkish government to allow for his release today\nUm you know he's still there so I'm not going to get into a lot of details about [noise]\nUh I uh turkey and how they handled this I Will say that ultimately they've done the right thing after two years and I think we could explain more of that\nUh once pastor Brunson is here in the United states that's that's where I Believe it but yes he the original charges including Christian ... which is absurd a\nAs a charge but ultimately again\nTurkey has done the
