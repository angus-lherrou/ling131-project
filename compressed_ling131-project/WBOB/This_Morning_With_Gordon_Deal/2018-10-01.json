I had great a hundred percent I mean the and I'm watching this right now and here we are and it's more character assassination door and said this is going to go on for more\nDays I understand the rules on on what the actual book takes place with this stuff doesn't have to keep going [noise]\nIt's not even press on Jay we're well beyond the stand timeline for these considerations it's time for them to build their constitutional mandate vote yes or no vote already [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm with you a hundred percent I mean this is a outrage don't forget the geology of the month here a C.

I think you're absolutely\nRight so I think Republican leaders need to grow a backbone Republicans are on notice that they will face relentless and use the opposition so they should be prepared to face this opposition forcefully\nAnd developed a fishing rules to advance the procession of nominations and confirmations expeditiously so yes the Democrats are going to use virtually every trick in

think just to put it very simply to get confirmed he's going to need one of those four but I think the universe is now between forty nine and fifty three\nOkay very good All right let's go ahead and take another phone coated I\nMade the universe where they are yeah for that yes votes or ... again I think that that's a key river you can get to fifty was vice president can push over the edge but if

scorched earth policy or because they're desperate to get third goal\nWhich is to prevent a five for conservative majority on the Supreme Court [noise] and my question is do you know what the nature of important cases are certainly for conservative different religious mind if people are coming up and Supreme Court\nWe just send them to orders list just came out on um on Thursday yesterday there were only five grams a so we're not going to start getting a real sense of the calendar and what big cases or it's they probably for another month so we have one that's pending we'll see what happens with it there are some others that are big so I'm\nThinking the next month you you know but you know there's always some\nSome ... ... the court ticket less and less cases but the significance of the cases is usually there's always three or four that are both busted for the term there will be this time to just the way the nature of the way the Supreme Court work so great question uh let me play something and I wanted to play and I could say that but I think we'd go and play this number fifty seven\n... moment tells you what's gonna happen if we keep this farce going\nPlenty of time claim

think he said something interesting this morning by the way to cut you off that it didn't give me this way anymore we had that bite but he didn't do that this morning and he said ah there's gonna be post cabin on ... ... and post Gavin nobody was go ahead here\nWell I think a Lindsey Graham is absolutely correct and again we have to think about what has happened in these hearings in the context\nOf the ritual defamation of Brett Kavanaugh essentially judge Kavanaugh has violated certain taboos ah ah for Democrats for it\nI'll let you to certain taboos ah ah for Democrats for instance his potential stance on abortion and reversing roe the weight back is a sacred cow his support all the constitution\nI'm not a living constitution but the text of the constitution that violates another democratic sacred cow and so in light of this opposition in light of this ritual defamation\nOf what we need from the next chairman of the Judiciary Committee hopefully a Republican is to face
