accusation we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country\nAnd ultimately ask ourselves question is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for in life\nTime her point when their credibility has been challenged by intimate people that knew who can be well at the last may when his temperament had been revealed in an emotional moment\nWhere do you use language that frankly shocked a lot of us\nCan now chief counsel for the American Center for law and justice Jay Sekulow\nI said this yesterday and it proves that I think three correct today and that is this the\n... nomination Brett Kavanaugh is gone through now three pair braces are phases phase one was an attack on judicial philosophy a that was the those that opposed the way that judge Kavanaugh would rule\nOn the way he views the constitution and that was the normal thing you have any Judiciary Committee hearings that was not able to knock judge Kavanaugh off\nA from a looking like a confirmation so ... one base to\nOf this issue went to the allegations on sexual assault there's an ongoing FBI investigation that may be wrapped up as early as today I think what I'm hearing it in the media sources I Am on this is that it doesn't appear to be any ... at least right now no cooperating evidence credible cooperating evidence of Dr Ford story not saying\nThat she wasn't traumatized her about a horrible thing may well happen to her but there doesn't appear to be cooperating evidence on that one I it doesn't appear although we haven't seen it yet\nIt'd be ... matter that's why you sit down with a three and you heard the three ... beginning of this and that is now ... she'll temperament so now they're going to the way in which he was asked questions\nAnd responded in his hearing and they do a human centered or play was use the phrase it was too partisan um you know look\nHere's the reality it's become partisan because the nature in scope of the attacks that were made on a no matter which side of this issue you're on what do you think Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed or should not be confirmed the fact is it's become part of it because the way the Senate has conducted\nThis hearing yes that's right I mean this has become extremely partisan\nConfirmation or they've all been I mean let's remember that Neil Gorsuch is always much covers it is the nuclear option has to be used because there were not going to be enough Democrats to ... a lawyer cultured right over the filibuster even in a very calm or a\nConfirmation process because of his judicial philosophy a phase one approach right they were able to to maintain their ground there Republicans call their bluff on this they had to go into these further phases\nTo put that into question not sixty anymore but can you get to fifty one and we're at a point today where that is that's a no one\nCould be with that with any certainty and say yes we can still get to fifty one on this there is no anybody or hearing that from is wrong I'm not saying that can't happen but but the potential is again I think very um questionable about uh if you try to make claims today\nThe big question is do we get to a vote before this week is up pushes this week it\nLet's go right depending on that so what is the latest on the time when we're taking your calls the critics say for thirty one ten what the latest on time right\nYeah jazz still think we get to it I'm a to a vote this week leader McConnell took to the floor of the United states and it just a couple of hours ago and again promised an up or down vote or to the American people on this nominee I think there'll probably be closer file tonight Jay and then votes on friday or Saturday is my guest but I Do think leader McConnell is serious about taking the vote\nAnd I you know let's let's say it straight the American people deserve to hear from the United states in in this the United States Senate needs to take that vote up or down

J. dawn\n[noise]\nOver\nBack you'll live this is Jordan secular we are talking about the cabinet nomination\nIs there are many reports the FBI will be a concluding its investigation uh that was a a re launch this will be the seventh on breast Brett Kavanaugh as his career\nAnd that they will be reporting this information to the uh the White House the senators\nAre as well um that means that we can have a as early as this evening a kind of the timing begin for a vote on the Kavanaugh nomination who continue to update you on that I mean I ... as we said that would be as the earliest would be the weekend so we we we don't get this is all\nPredicting what will be happening\nLikely in the future any of this could move by a day or so\nAnd I don't think that's such a huge ... day here day there is the biggest issue I think it's days become a big issue I Want to go right to the phones one hundred sixty four thirty one twenty hundred six eight for three one one zero let's take my comments withholding online to Mike in North Carolina you're on the air\nYet I'm taking guy for all that you do you do great work um my question is it's obvious that dot dot the Ford did not want to handle this in the public purview and um the leaking\nCaused the firestorm that we had to deal with is there anything that's going to happen regardless of how the nomination turns out to go back and find out exactly how the weak occurred who you know ...\nI think the two to ... to your statement 'cause I I think one there's a question about whether Dr Ford wanted this to be\nGo public with this she decided she was so I'm whether she was forced to do that or not by this leak or she had a part to do with the league and the wasted or five tier I said it was confidential\nIt was to be held this confidential but let me go to Stan and just quickly than it is there any investigation that legal I mean I don't think long term that's going to be the issue the issue is whether Brett Kavanaugh gets confirmed or not but ... is there any investigation who did this I don't\nThink so Jordan I mean I don't think there's any justification for how Dianne Feinstein handled that she could have handled it with confidence and yet still ask these questions in a private meeting or a closed session I don't think they'll look into it here's what I Do think will happen to Jordan\nI think the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee likely to be Lindsey Graham and he's already told you this he has said look I Know the play but now I Know it's coming we are not going to handle nominations like the city in the future so while I don't think there'll be an investigation of Dianne Feinstein\nThe next time around when these allegations come down\nI think you're going to see the committee and the floor move on a regimented timeline and the only opportunity to get allegations like these out will be in that open timeframe I don't think they'll allow for delays like this in the future\nAll right let's go right back to the phones one eight hundred six eight four thirty one tenth Scott's calling from Virginia on line three Scott welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\n[noise] hey thanks Jordan getting beyond it gets to love the uh the book or quote that you guys played uh but uh you know his comment that the rationale that because they are so many questions that it's time to move on to another candidate and also he cited\nIn that it's time to move on to another candidate and also he cited that me because we're in typical ordered some times in conjunction with that [noise] that that's rationale to move on [noise] ah that's just a it's I'm certain that that's the rationale that\nThere were but that's precisely where they are so precisely where this is right now is paid for it I mean you are in agree that you're never too is dead although I think within a couple of hours it's going to be your in face three and I don't think it's just space three and they're mad Andy the way he answered questions\nAfter the way they attacked him his family and I mean again these were very serious things were very serious allegations made against him\nYeah I don't see judicial temperament necessarily means that when you were attacked personally on your family is attacked and made the public the object of public ridicule I don't think judicial temperament means that you shut your mouth and take it\nI mean you can fight back and that's exactly what he did and that's the kind of judge I Want to see I Want to see a judge with some opinions in some strength of character to do the things that Kevin did when he was attacked personally Harry\nIt'd be looking at this is kind of ... the ... from where it is right now um I think is Jordan said it comes down to three and they instead comes down to three ... and the fact is that they donate\nA very aggressive I Would call it character assassination on bread capital if in fact the FBI report comes back with no credible cooperating evidence how does that leave it in your view is that how do you not to mad at that point they may not like agents were investigated bully as they asked\nI think it will be difficult but it's also important just to remember a that his nomination remains in a state of uncertainty\nAnd the Democrats are unprepared to stop attacking the nominee\nAnd placing pressure on middle of the road Republicans yeah so I think that's the that's the issue I think in terms of justice and fairness the nomination I should but not many should be confirmed\nBut we're we live in a realm where it's all about power it's all about politics and at the end of the day what ever babies we're in at the bottom line is one issue I think abortion\nDick Blumenthal or the senator from Connecticut sat as much a today I'm so they're prepared to use any tactic in the book to defeat but not many\nBut the question here yeah I agree but here's the question that ... what would you say Jordan and I think this is part of this this\nIf you look at where it is actually right today assuming the ... this was assuming the FBI ... comes back with no conclusions and he said the just the thrill to report that says we couldn't find credible cooperating evidence if that's the case\nTo judge jam or deny him it's only because the Republicans are standing together yes I Do to make that clear the Democrats who say they don't like his personality they don't like how he handled\nUh the hearing uh they were never going to vote for him they were all no votes every single one that he spoke to in that hearing in the district but he was a no vote on Brett Kavanaugh was already and announce no vote\nBefore he opened his mouth before he had to come back a after his judicial philosophy hearings and then to this personality here by his personal life ... they were they were nose before all that right some didn't even meet with him\nOr Democrats or he only met with a sixty some odd senators because the many refused set big said that being said\nIt is Republicans who will be responsible for his failure now I'm not saying it's every Republican personally I'm saying it is Republican senators\nWho have the majority it ... it would be Jeff Flake and when they have places in an essay what does he do play engaged because he's retired so he's trying to make a name for himself before because I mean if you weren't alone you know I mean you know if he's a weekly\nLet's face it he gets ... gets in there for hours works on them in the Judiciary Committee he comes out folders Hansi sits back and he says I'll vote either get advanced it but there's got to be an investigation so now that the best again now there's an investigation or does it do we have to do we have that is their sound from Jeff Flake saying the part is an issue\nYou know I Want to play that we have let's go ahead and play it\nI was I was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me that and I tell myself to give a little leeway because of what he's been through\nThe people are out alleging that he was guilty of rape right I mean if you don't forget what they were asking Brett Kavanaugh fat I mean I mean he attempted rape\nNo they were always just planning to move on and you know Jay and during that hearing I I was\n... when you listen to what justice excuse me when you listen to what Senator Flake said I mean he defended himself go ahead [noise] [noise]\nWell I just say I was critical of Cory Booker Kamala Harris were running for president during the hearing I\nLook I think that's what Jeff lakes do and you just went to New Hampshire so you know we can criticize a political motives on both sides and I think all three of them J. I think that's what they were doing type here's what we're doing we're here for another thirty minutes we're taking your calls winning hundred sixty four thirty one day and\nSo again much as we come back we'll one line open and there were ... lines are going to open up the way to get will do some calls even in the first segment coming back in the second half hour hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're not getting the whole broadcast remember just go over to a seal Jay Roach screaming at their or Facebook or periscope live streaming there as well back one more moment\n[noise]\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional on religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now\nThe the L ... daughter\nThey haven't moved off that position Jay well while sitting Senator Flake has so I suspect if it comes back clean there's no new allegation that would be you know disqualifying I think those two would be a yes vote I don't know about Senator Flake because he has\nGone along with Democrats and changed the goalposts looked at the Senate Democrats say they're not going to be satisfied no there's no question\nThe question is will Senate Republicans take this vote and if they do are there enough Republicans to get it over the line\nAnd let's go ahead and take a let's take Jeff online sixth ... Jeff you're calling from Ohio you're on the air Jeff\nHi thank you for all you do I greatly appreciate it but my comment is pretty specifically that the Democrats have already one they got the phrase the question through the media to the public and so now if they wanted them to do more\nThey did so he was defeated late that turn out in the mid term elections if Kavanaugh\nIs confirmed and sits on the bench they have a huge effort to push the base for the midterm election saying look at what Trump is look at the evil person he put on the back\nOf this is an interesting question is what is the political ramifications of the confirmation so well I'll go to Jordan fan first if he gets through the process I think the Democratic basis is kind of the flood deflate it'd be a is it they they show up every time they they're right on the edge of\nKind of this these great victories they can't um they can't quite do it and what I say it has more to do with the city that it does the house react and I don't think and I don't see the Senate switching to democratic controlled ... which means the judicial confirmation will be up to Republicans are and remember this is the role of the United States Senate yeah uh and so again\nIt it might affect um uh again that the the interest in the left believing that they that the Democrats could get it they say that I mean they've thrown\nEverything they possibly can of this I mean literally the kitchen was asked you that ... I mean they they literally I mean we're in face do we know there can be face for would just be trying to wait it out but it looks like Mitch McConnell exporting than let me go quickly then I'll go to Eric than it looks like McConnell's not gonna let it to go to face for\nHe's going to call the vote he figured that if there's gonna be cloture\nYeah he's had both yesterday and today jaded devote would be this week on the floor\nOf the Senate such pretty public so that's one thing face for here Harry absolutely needed it important to her laundry face for because the Democrats are increasingly desperate on this a senator Jill a brand of New York reaffirmed her opposition to judge\nA cabinet all in a Tuesday night tweet and set her colleagues must decide if women's voices they're traumas and their stories matter to them in determining how to vote on this confirmation\nNowhere in the tweet was there any evidence that she was concerned about the presumption of innocence yeah which we deploy in the United states might avoid taking calling me and says to any any so thrilled to reports are going to be done the reports gonna come out\nIf there was credible\nCooperative evidence I suspect we probably would have heard by now but ... that's ... ... ... let's assume for a moment for this if there is credible cooperative evidence his his nomination would be over that's right the three if the Republicans are going to say no if there is no\nCredible cooperative evidence they should say yes 'cause that's where we're going to I mean it is that I mean\nIt's that straightforward at that point it should be ... or ... moving moving the goalpost\nRight where say the goal post a moving which is a I think\nAgain it's how far can they get a Republicans do their bidding to continue this fight it gets spread cabin on to get to the next phase and to continue the war hoping that it's also impacting\nTo sitters not on the Judiciary Committee who are Republicans Murkowski in college who also are going to play a poor girl because I think we can go to Nancy is calling in California and all this is important have the numbers game is very important now as we get to the stage Nancy welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're on the air kind of anti\nHigh salad and seriously you know it's possible that kill out of our faith trick kick up half bringing it to forty nine forty nine and can't come in and bring it\nWell it's a fifty three fifty fifty well how would that work than what they may not know they're going to vote I mean I there's no way they're not voting\nThere they're going to vote I mean theoretically a tie it any number would require a tie breaking vote you know if you had an ... an outlet to be on it that's not happening you\nKnow so here's a question if you lose let's say like we've gotten Murkowski and you got Collins he's confirmed\nRight now there are some people that say well the last Murkowski and flake but you got Collins is named could you get a couple of Democrats do you get um do you get your mansion out of West Virginia and people are shaped anti saying no no the Democrats are not going to be the ones that put him over they're not going to do\nThat would be so I mean I just that's not how you prepare for this\n... it was so you you don't need those kind of options\nIf ... if it would be some kind of miraculous events so um to see or Democrats come in to save her Republican nominee this record so we don't need to take that way we need facts facts are forty nine for down he lost you know what I mean you can't you're not going to get fifty is not enough\nI'm Mike Pence you've you've got to get over the line here um you could not lose a more than one Republican\nTo get ... to ... than that for your weight shaking her head\nOn a mission and I and I don't keep ... confirmed it'll be confirmed with mansion and high camp but they will not be the deciding vote they will hold out until he's confirmed you can only lose one Republican\nSo here's what they're telling you if in fact the Republican stick together and and cabinet is goes over fifty then you may see high camp and mentioned join for their own political purposes to keep their seat\nIf he is short by a boat or to do not expect them as well Jordan saying do not expect them to put the Republican nominee over the top no absolutely not I I just I I\nThink we're at a position where any Democrats are going to do Republicans favorite in fact that makes it the no vote easier for um a Joe mansion and high give it to be out of the numbers look in West Virginia for medicine right now he says nearly a nine point lead so I get it less\nOr he would like to think vote yes if\nThe Republicans are already there that makes his election a reelection easier if you can vote for Brett Kavanaugh but if the if there's a reason\nThe election easier if you can vote for Brett Kavanaugh but if the if there's a reason if there he will not I don't he will not be the vote for him it's just he's not going to a that would be too much for Democrats\n... let's say look at the I'm Talking about the Senate for a moment and then we'll ... we'll take all the calls that are so everybody on the old stay on the line here but the than looking at the Senate seats that are that could switch Republican where do you see right now\nOr the the one that's most likely to switch to Republican is Heidi Heitkamp see that's why she's talked about so much in this process she's well known when Florida I think he is he likely switches well I'd put him actually more likely than ah than Joe Manchin a J I think the mansion has a fairly decent lead it but I don't want to\nBuild Austin is a ... chance of voting for this now know that that is correct he's already said he's in now right I mean such a thing where it down to just a handful of Republicans that really matter here are kind of let the ... the Democrats matter this it's their influencing these\nRepublicans that's why the Democrats Mitt or is it there influencing these three Republicans were trying to\nDie we're going to take it last segment broadcast coming up you know what that means we take all your phone call so if you want to get a call in one eight hundred sixty fourth or even ten\nOr jam right now may open up a couple a during the break here so eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten if you're on Facebook and parents
