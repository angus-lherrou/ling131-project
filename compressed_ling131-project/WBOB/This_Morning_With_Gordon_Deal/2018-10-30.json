loss of these people into selling attack\nYeah we we too often seed attacks on place to house of worship\nChurches in uh Texas uh we've seen the attack now in Pittsburgh and then we know specifically there's the issue with anti Semitism and that is that is an issue that the U.S has had to deal with or that other countries deal within Europe there's really been dealt with us instead of the beginning of time in fact\nThe main topic we were we are going to focus on today as you heard of the ... of the broadcast if you want to talk to us on air one hundred sixty four thirty one tended the escalation by Israel\nAnd their response to Iranian backed groups both say the Gaza Strip but also in Syria and how the White House is backing is Israeli involved but I think you'll be surprised we

this Jordan secular we are taking your phone calls at one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten is we acknowledge\nPray for a those affected by the at the tree of life to the guy the shooting a condemning anti Semitism in and understanding that as an organization\nUm we do a lot to condemn the other boycott divested station movement in the United states\nA lot of this anti Semitism on college campuses which is exactly what it is in the form of being anti Israel I and then these distinctions that that these groups try to make which are just absurd um is getting something as organization we combat some of these individuals we should all combat\nAnd acknowledges it is an issue that's been in the United states as it is in most of the world unfortunately I'm as since the beginning of time and ah today on the broadcast Russia focusing in on what Israel has been doing in response to the tax on the Jewish\nTo seeing it on what Israel has been doing in response to the tax on the Jewish state of Israel I think it's a unique time to point out that there has been an escalation over the weekend in fact just this weekend\nIn Israel out of the Gaza Strip so targeted Israel thirty rockets were fired by God's up based militants have this group is called Palestinian Islamic jihad or sometimes just referred to as Islamic jihad\nTo Israel as a government holds from us responsible for Islamic jihad activities at ... home Austin Islamic jihad work together often but there are times when ah they are separate\nAnd so you'll see that Islamic jihad is also based in a Damascus is where a lot of their leaders are headquartered to get protection\nA so that they are not actually in harm's way directly and so a power their leadership their mosques leadership\nMuslim brother ... leadership both groups emanating by the way from the Muslim Brotherhood out from us but interesting enough even though it's coming out of the Sunni world\nGetting a lot of its funding from the sheer world in Iran so first let's talk now this weekend I'll go to Henry Hudson Harry this weekend we saw really an escalation ... just specifically between\nA Islamic jihad and Israel says comes out of the Gaza Strip but thirty rockets being fired at the state of Israel and then Israel responding back with that specific attacks on\nEighty targets absolutely so this is an important ... an ominous development\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ... member today and it's easy to do is go on line to sign up for the the L Jay\n[noise]\nBack in ... this is Jordan secular we are to hear phone calls at one eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten\nBut kind of getting you up to speed on what is happening in in the world the middle east specifically with Israel and the expansion of military operations by Israel into Syria in response to what's happened\nFrom groups that are operate inside the Gaza Strip like Islamic jihad but it all emanating from out of Damascus by Iran um who is using its a proxy forces like Hezbollah uh to be very active now that there's been this civil unrest in\nSyria to a point where both Israel and the United states are considered not just about the arms build up\nBy Iran and Syria and the ours build up to groups like Hezbollah or Islamic jihad or Hamas but also the idea that ah the Iranians may use the unrest in Syria\nAnd their support for the Assad government\nAnd now that ISIS you ISIS was kind of this factor\nThat both are in the United states and Iran were fighting neither some were supportive a and a and a a run for ... you know these religious reasons or political reasons as well uh but now that it's not as much of a factor there's concern that Iran may actually establish a\nA more permanent military force so not maybe not just like it's unique\nGuards force but a more permanent military base inside Syria which is a threat to the United states but you know obviously is a threat to Israel as well so just over the past Eighteen months this doesn't get discussed as much in the news but I think it's important I mean we have a lot going on in our country this affects our national security\nThat just in the past Eighteen months Israel has struck about two hundred targets inside Syria that is unique folks because typically\nOr is that would be you know Syria would be responding to its own military but it can't write as too weak to respond or to the Israeli forces and because it's really in areas that\nThe Syrian Government has to a certain set lost control or ceded control to groups or countries like Iran who said basically you can\nAround this area and so the there have been in the past two months two hundred targeted attacks or by Israel inside Syria and it's also in I think important to point out this isn't just on the border areas\nThat unique to the you know Israel and Syria kind of the militarized zone but far into eastern Syria as well so we take your phone calls about one hundred sixty four thirty one to that one eight hundred six eight for three when was your let's go right to the phones Steven Washington state on line one Steven welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nThank you for having me on your show let me give you the reader is a little bit background about me I'm an analyst with the association\nOf strategic analysis I wrote my first book ran in two thousand and six during the war in Israel it's called trans war of terror and its nuclear delivery capability was published in two thousand seven is still being sought Amazon and a few other books that are being\nThousand seven is still being sought Amazon\nAnd a few other books that are being so let me tell you ... you're really hitting a very important subject but I Want to flesh out some some things that you may or may not know first of all Israel turned over the Gaza Strip there was\nThis same agreements that are being used today for a two state solution we create the Palestinian state in Israel forcibly remove some ten thousand is really from God\nAnd handed it over to\nThe Palestinians it became a launch pad for war took over the Iranian backed much but what people don't know how long how much has been tied to Iran it goes clear back to the time of Khomeini\nNow let me let me jump in Stephen because again when we give out there's a lot of information for people\nHow moss is an organization that existed for much longer than it's been as well known because it was not also in control of territory so it became like Hezbollah\nTo some extent a west this idea that in the for the U.S military they're not just a terror group highly within a state or with the territory but they are now running a specific territory they are the government\nOf of the area or whether you believe that they're legitimate or illegitimate so they have these groups have moved on\nA through how they were either you know they were started as as terror organizations but they have they have morphed into um basically they became the platform of dug up for what ISIS tried to become\nAs well which is to actually control the branches of government as well as these armed or a ... uh they would call armed resistance we recall terrorism\nYeah and they are all directly connected to Iran and Iran right now Jordan as we speak they are attempting to do a similar thing in Iraq they\nWere trying to undermine and influence the the established government in Iraq that Iraq can become much like the Gaza Strip\nOr were has the law is in Lebanon and that is\nDirectly connected with weaponry restrict the strategy with influence to the nation over on what Iran is trying to do they're trying to establish an ... an arc of influence that goes from Iran through Iraq through Syria all the way to Lebanon injured the border of Israel and it's really a malignancy in the region Jordan\nAnd that's why Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states Jordan Egypt quietly support Israel because they do not want this cancer to spread in the area and it is a true malignancy their Israel is trying to to to support what would be a major war by these attacks trying to stop Iranian influence\nListen to this I mean this tells you a lot that Mohammed is era the Iranian foreign minister he was on CBS face the nation just yesterday\nI remind you that even the day before our mid term elections there the the increase sanctions on Iran kick back in ... Iran is is you will see this kind of PR move internationally by Iran a now but listen to their foreign minister or just yesterday\nOn an American a Sunday news program CBS face the nation take us\nI think I could support that the U.S provides whose hobby they'd be time to Israel has enabled them to caddy atrocities who\nHad been halting since this package lie\nAnd I I mean Harry I'll go right to you there that is the Iranian foreign minister tying\nThese two groups that are two countries together or the U.S works with ... different and unique ways but trying to tie publicly what is it not putting knowledge by Saudi Arabia publicly but that they are somehow a that working together against Iraq that's why he's trying to go after them obviously\nYou're absolutely correct essentially what the Iranian foreign minister is trying to do he is trying to deflect attention away from the Iranian\nMalignancy be a rainy and atrocities in the middle east by blaming the cross cities that are ongoing in the middle east on Saudi Arabia\nAnd Israel oh so essentially it's outrageous oh Ron is the number one state sponsor of terror in the world period\nAnd it's clear beyond question that Iran has a plan in mind they are attempting to master mind control of the middle east in Syria and Lebanon\nAnd in Gaza as a launch pad for future wars for control of the middle east or extending to Yemen and essentially to the Saudi Arabian peninsula\nBut a lot of people also starting to ask it on Facebook and we've got a call about it as well we'll get to our second half hour of the Russian role in this [noise] how are they aligned\nWith Iran why are they aligned with Iran got a book out about that will take your calls one eight hundred six aid for\nThirty one to that one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten as we update you on the latest news out of the middle east evolving Israel how it affects us interest in of course this is an eight days out from our mid term elections here in the United states the second half hour Jay sexual I've come up a great time to get your phone calls in his right now\nOne eight hundred six eight four thirty one ten we'll be right back\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country in the work of the American Center for launches has never been more important\nThan the AC ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom and\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ lawn lawn sign up right now the CEO Jane daughter\nReading between the airline ... phone that Saudi Arabia is a core ally for the United states and a wrong who are well\nNo I'm not saying that I'm saying that the United states choices in the middle east wrong [noise] and he's wrong choice as to the disaster in our region\nHere what's interesting there to the west is that right away he gets asked the opportunity would it be better for the U.S to work with Iran is a partner that Saudi Arabia and he says no not say that I mean there's still the inside the Iranian government\nAnd they get tried to separate for the people but inside that government a radical hatred for the for the west and it's not just Israel it it is death to America that is chanted outside by these government rally so absolutely\nIran still refers to Israel is a little little Satan and the United states is the big thing yeah and the fact that he can say that with a straight face that says a lot about\nHow can vent sing that can be to to unwitting people who might listen to them is a volatile part of the region a lot of potential repercussions to any actions that are taken as we said earlier is was trying to ward off a major war\nRussia is involved they are providing and an attempt to prop up the Assad government you know anti aircraft missiles in just last week announced they were sending a more advanced as three hundred anti aircraft systems\nOr to the Syrian military which could really put Israeli pilots in danger and by the way we do provide some support especially intelligence to Israel as far as where a Iranian backed forces and their proxies are\nThey do have some troops in Syria\nAgainst the balls are part of the world the ... and the rather shin guards are there and some numbers what people are sometimes forget though\nAnd that is we have five thousand United States troops still stationed in Syria as well trying to to get rid of the final pockets of ISIS and what have you and so the potential for missteps is great I think Israel in the United states are trying to be responsible to toward dissolve\nIran and to a certain extent Russia they continue to do things which make some of those mistakes more likely to happen and that would be very regrettable\nDid you think that people are still voting artist I mean I Do think that people are as engaged other foreign policy issues as maybe they were uh two years ago or they or is it because of groups like ISIS\nAs was said there's still the U.S military they're finding the pockets of ISIS but as their their influence and power\nDwindled so significantly and even even a ... there what was happening all around the world including our own country but in in Europe in Western Europe specifically so is that kind of decreased you are people I I I mean there's definitely not as much attention\nOf what's happening I'm overseas\nBut also do you think that people maybe south voting on that I'd like to hear from you how this influence say a year to ... to vote in the mid term elections give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tenth that one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero we talked about this idea that Iran\nUtilizes now this is coming in because there's new sanctions that will be go into place against Iran just next Monday so week from today a but this idea of of using aircraft to transfer weapons Joe's calling from Florida got a question about that on line three Joel welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're on the air\nYeah thank you very much for taking my call I think west may have um answer to our question or if in fact it's a rush and a civilian aircraft butter transporting they use a sophisticated guidance systems\nAnd um my other question would be whether we have means to impose sanctions against those airlines for their participation\nSo that a lot of this was reopened up both the airlines and the manufacturers\nOf the of the aircraft themselves was reopening through the sanctions have a hair with the stakes were moved up by the the the Iranian nuclear deal by the Obama administration suddenly the air ... aircraft industry so those actual manufacturers\nAre and it also private the actual cares as well start looking as Iran has the potential to do business with\nUp so early in the United states is looking at imposing and has already imposed very broad based sanctions on Iran\nAnd so it has severe implications both for aircraft manufacturers\nBut also for airlines in most a European companies as well as most American and I think a Canadian companies\nThey have all ready or reduce their involvement with the Iranian authorities why because the sanctions are either already imposed or they're coming\nUh so uh on November the fifth or we will see a new sanctions on Iran and those sanctions will continue to serve to deter\nA Iranian authorities going forward a but in my view it's very very possible that we will need to\nCreate new sanctions or to bring more pressure to bear on the rainy an aggression throughout the region and really throughout the world\n... ... to the caller's point though is not Russian aircraft that are transporting these weapons who had acknowledging they are Russian made aircraft they're flown usually by Iranian hair is a civilian carrier right Russian made planes flying out of ...\nYeah you'll see this'll be depending on where you've all travel around the world where you ... you will see that there are obviously there's these top manufacturers there's your boys in the United states is Airbus in France\nI'm of civilian aircraft but there are many countries that are not able to purchase those some because of economic reasons that the airline you know the cares could afford it or or second because of sanctions so that you'll see the aircraft ... that you may be flying on\nA is a actually manufactured in Russia or China um and so on but oftentimes it's the carrier would still be flown by a domestic nationals so not by foreign national CEOs equipment that that was sold off by countries to either didn't have sanctioned so at the time they weren't as broad\nUh the inter they weren't international sanctions that has been one of the issues with the Iranian nuclear deal is that\nThey weren't international sanctions or ... that has been one of the issues with the Iranian nuclear deal is that\nThough the U.S is re imposing very tough sanctions and that will affect an already has affected European business as a at ... countries and businesses that are based outside the United states it is how a Russian military I mean a Russian made aircraft\nGet to Iran a civilian uh uh that they're they're commercial airline industry is because the international sanctions that ... that were that were so dramatically pulled back by the Iranian nuclear deal\nYes and in addition it's important to note that the reach of American sanctions for instance on her on may in fact be somewhat muted by virtue of the fact that we are dealing perhaps with Russian manufactured\nUh um planes all but it's also important to note ... by way of background to the United states has also imposed some sanctions on Russia\nAnd hopefully those sanctions will continue to bite\nCoast we have a lot to talk about our final segment want to get into the mid term elections as well just a eight days out of
