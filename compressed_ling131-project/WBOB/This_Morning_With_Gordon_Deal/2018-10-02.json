[noise]\n\nYour voice outlook James Comey raised in the Kavanaugh nomination\nWashington DC\nJames Comey writes this and the New York times his op ed says this is what a shock clock in the yard but it's better to get professional seven days to find facts that have no professional investigation after\nPhone lines are open for your questions right now call one eight hundred sixty four three one one zero than\nToday by the FBI is going to go through this process are going to do interviews they don't come to a conclusion that still something that ... Hassan is they're going to go and they're going to provide information instead of ...\nWell something that is going to go and they're going to provide information to have to make a determination pulled over for having an awful lot\nNow chief counsel for the American Center for law and justice Jay Sekulow\nEverybody was on the broadcast for taking your calls it a hundred and sixty four thirty one tend to want to get into the conversation early so when we went up\nHere the FBI decided now the White House authorizes an FBI background investigation to include two aspects at least that's what we understand right now and those are a more investigation as it relates to Dr Ford and then\nA and a second to the ... part of the same overall investigation of Brett Kavanaugh's background relating to a classmate of his at Yale named uh Mrs Ramirez\nNow this is an ongoing James call me in the interim has entered into the fray saying well seven days is putting a shot clock in places inappropriate that the FBI should be able to do this and of course he he raises and some are pretty condescending statements really about a Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh's character\nBut this is a new development ah I think it would be going to be honest with the evaluation of where it stands right now I think it's as looking I Would say what do you think Jordan\nI think it's a fifty fifty shot and we don't know what the FBI will uncover we know that ... and\nA doctor for its case that there are definitely people to contact a and I'm sure they've done that already uh to see if their statements have lined up with what they've already said which is it just didn't occur so no one has corroborated that story from Dr for 'em and then second some of these other incidents as well like a ...\nAll those were a a explained by the accusers\nA and the accuser that case to have happened in front of other people so you would imagine that if there is so if that did occur\nThat other people we contacted by the FBI different than even like a ... committee staffer um even though that's under oath is well above contacted by the FBI would uh be able to corroborate a story like that because it was a ... something you would remember\nHappening I'm so far no one has\nPublicly either people have made a a mean comments or ... or degrading comments about break have this time in jail none of them have corroborated the story a which we don't have to get the details of the of the incident by I think it's a mission Ramirez\nSo um that being said the FBI abstruse contact everyone that they can figure out of the dorm or that facility and figure out if anybody is is willing to ... to corroborate that story if not I think the fifty fifty changes to Seventy five percent chance\nReally happens if they find a cooperating witness and\nWell the corroborating witness doesn't necessarily mean that it's a prosecutor bookcase\nAlthough remember this is a political issue not is not an issue that in court it's not a a judicial matter but a cooperating witness could be subject to the impeachment and ... on a variety of the grounds maybe they didn't maybe they say they saw it but then when you cross examine them\nTheir ... their recollection is flawed or other things come up so just saying a cooperating witness a found doesn't necessarily mean that it's a prosecutor bookcase or a politically viable case\nOne of the things I'm looking at areas I see that a Dianne Feinstein said the White House nippy I should release details on the scope of the cabinet background best occasion and keep a Congress informed on any changes this needs to be a real investigation must get all the facts but the fact is that the FBI does these investigations as routine for them they know how to do them\nAbsolutely so I think one of the things that we should be concerned about is the fact that the Senate Judiciary committee now wants to direct the FBI in how to investigate and that's clearly beyond their\nPurview so what's what's your thought where do you think this give me your in your twenty second view of them just right\nNow it's been painful to watch that I agree with Jordan is fifty fifty and if they can't come up with corroborating evidence I think it's Seventy five twenty five the he'll get confirmed\nMy gut reaction was subject to that I thought what they would find I mean unless they find cooperating evidence that sets subject to cross examination that seems to be credible\nIs that they're going to not be able to they're not going to call Dr ... they're going to say there's no evidence substantiate in her claim and there's no evidence that points out that Brett Kavanaugh was not telling the truth that's generally how we would come out but for the evidence\nThat couldn't turn terminology sorry we're taking your calls we want the reaction we contentious Supreme Court by give us a call\nIt's a critical time for our nation and for the world with so many challenges facing our country the work to be American Center for launches has never been more important than right now\nAt the AC OJ were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nDefending human like

the book the spills legal ... reported by Israel's in I mean\nHere's your copy today in Jerusalem of biblical and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon were born to know [noise]\n[noise] it wasn't\nThat good broadcasts everyone there is a I just had Sandy come during their break I'm going to do this for a\nRadio on his two cars were former U.S attorney work a lot with the FBI walk through this investigation looks like well the ... the FBI is given a directive by the White House to investigate the ... the individuals that people who have these a lot of knowledge of what happened with\nKevin ... is other places and they go and they talk to them\nThey're not under oath but it's still a felony to lie to the FBI and they get granular very detail about what it is that happened in the allegations they do a report on a form three oh two that's just a number of of form a good ten forty and the Treasury Department Jay that you're familiar with\nAnd they do form and then they call it ... the forms and they give them to the ... just as the White House in the White House makes a decision as to whether they're going to continue with this nomination or not now the White House to make that decision or would actually ... will also go to the\nJudiciary Committee so it could go to the judiciary the white guy to pull it I mean right right\nRight the White House to make a decision based on their operating evidence that that there's sufficient evidence there that it's the nominees\nUnique there'd be alligator and Harry the allegation on the ah I Want to\nThe nomination you think they'd be alligator and Harry the allegation on the ah I Want to get into the specifics of the what that allegation are but everybody saw him last week the allegation at the Yale University\nA event party and those allegations proved to be true which there's no evidence of and other than the one witness I mean that's one that's ... ... if that ends up being cooperated subject to review instill\nAnd it is credible whether you think that does for the nomination\nWell I think the nomination is in deep trouble and I think at this point in time it's very possible to speculate\nThat that allegation a remains a the most serious hurdles to his confirmation\nUh it's important to realize that we're ... the prosecutor who ask questions at the hearing suggested that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against judge Kavanaugh based on the testimony of the two witnesses\nLast week so I think if there is some ... corporation with respect to the second allegation\nA bat could pose a a real hurdle for judge Kavanaugh that if\nIn fact there's cooperation absolutely absolutely huge question yeah and I think one of the most interesting things about Mitchell's report to the Republican Senate and she sent all the Republican senators is she said that this is a matter of he said she said but\nThis case is even weaker than that in her report that's a very telling statement about how she views of the witnesses that have come forward\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL gene member today it's easy to do is go online and sign up ... daughter\n[noise]\nFrom that what we were in the break we were talking about something that is the fact is no matter what they come back with is probably not going to be an up or for those that are opposed to judge Kavanaugh hum you got this sort of listen to a senator her own up from Hawaii this gives you an idea this was just on yesterday's broadcast Sunday\nBut the thing is that every financial matters and there are there's time to go to the bottom of it even after seven days that's bad enough for them to limit the FBI or for the scope and who they're going to a question that that really have a [laughter]\nI like to change the way far spent a lot of the kind of inflation that all of us are expecting ...\n... what what is the ... and ... they're expecting to conduct\nI mean I don't know you know the heroin or has been against us in the beginning nothing that was said\nIn the Senate hearings is going to convince heroin or Booker Kamala Harris or any of those Democrats on that committee I don't care if they find concessions that center\nAs it by Brett Kavanaugh that I did it not did would a Senator Kennedy said that I did a long ago that's not going to convince these Democrats\nThis is a political process they made up their mind that they're going to block this and the way they do it is what we call and the law deal or Tory deal a obstruct and resist and it worked\nOn Jeff Flake so just like you to a public statement as we're fish and shrimp fried rice public statement he was a yes vote on Kavanaugh after the hearing was tough but that'd be is that all changed because as we pointed out there in the show\nThey had Democrat after Democrat allowed to speak and slander Brett Kavanaugh once again and attack him once again for the second day again as secondary in a row\nAttack his character and saying I'm horrible this was and we all talked about it on the air live that can you believe they're continuing to do this why Chuck Grassley allowing this Chuck Grassley is to blame for this I mean this is why Jeff like now\nThe only thing we don't know is whether or not Jeff Flake would have been enough though\nUm it may have been that he was warned off by that not just Jeff Flake but by Collins and Murkowski\nUh but I Do think that if Republicans will just held the vote friday morning in the ... committee Jeff Flake would have been a yes vote wouldn't have had this whole discussion it would have moved to the floor and uh and then we would have to let let Mitch McConnell do his thing behind ... finally closed door now\nThe Senate has really given up their job is mostly could said they've given us over to the FBI really to make that decision for them in my opinion\nIt's going to take a phone call or back to the phones or we go let's go to die in a new ad on line to die and welcome to Jay circulated\nHi thanks for taking my call today and my\nQuestion is how do we know that I'm ... with all the non hired a bipartisan not even bipartisan extra part a ten yeah work at the FBI has been doing in the last ... years how do we know that they're not going to um be bought off for\nBecause these are these are field agents that I've got an assigned tasks to do that is going to be under a microscope\nAnd when you work with the ... and your military experience was when you work with um in military police and military investigators when they're under a microscope and they're going to be under a microscope here they're just going to they're going to do their job\nWere absolutely going to do their job there on our under a microscope the FBI cannot afford ... going board\nJob there on our under a microscope the FBI cannot afford ... going board in light of what's happened in the last two years but these are rank and file agents are they are people with integrity or they they will be very pointed in their questions they will look for specific things and they will give I think an impartial report back to\nThe limit only what is it like it looks without getting graphic what is the particular thing they're looking for for instance in the ... matter they want other witnesses to confirming yeah with which\nThey you know ... there was an allegation got an allegation Brett Kavanaugh denies it Ramirez makes the right side so it's he said and she said he said she did he said she said he did he said he didn't do that particular act\nNow they've got to get in there and find out is there anybody else who saw him do it\nOr is alleged to have done it and then when they're on his art is that's not over necessarily they have to be they can be subject to their subject to cross examination this subject do where where are you how old were you were you drunk did you see it did someone tell you about it did you see yourself tell me the circumstances in which you did see it\nAnd then they get then it can get graphically you know a gone into I mean they have a cooperating witness it would be trouble for writing that was it was but other than a credible witness that's required to try it doesn't necessarily mean just gr operation does it all together it's gotten to be somebody who's got\nCredibility and I hope it's not a Peter Struck that Peter up here struck a I mean from the ... not ... to ... I Hope it's not that kind of an agent who got an extra very what's your answer this right now\nMy sense is that the rank and file field agent at the FBI will engage in an honest investigation\nOr and I doubt seriously that this investigation will be politicized like FBI investigations were in the past under James ... tenure it's important to remember that if you go back to his press conference in July twenty sixteen\nHis press conference clearing Hillary Clinton was not supported by the middle aged investigations essentially this was the decision taken at headquarters and so I think\nTo the extent that judge Kavanaugh is investigated by field agents and they issue or they are\nPut together a thrill to report those reports will be honest there will be at some integrity associate it with them and so I think at the end of the day we can rely on them do\nJordan and politically looking at it right now we're probably a day away from getting the report yeah what do you anticipate\nWell I think this says it well ... Murphy the senator from Connecticut Democrat his sweet before they they agreed to the FBI investigation was the only reason not to do an FBI investigations Republicans want to rush cabin up through there is no rush the three women are willing to testify under oath and anyone who has information dispute the claim should be to\nAfter they order the FBI investigation same Senator Chris Murphy tweets yeah of course there should be an FBI investigation but whatever they find does it change the fact the cabinet especially after his performance yesterday is the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetime that I'm just saying so for the mainstream Democrat\nIn the party not to monitor it's not even the most live which is a major Democrats\nThere is no moving them they don't care about the FBI report that was just a delay tactic like and he said to hopefully have more pile on something else or ... and uh and and this idea I mean uh Debbie said are they trying to get the judge to go through another hearing a publicly I think they'd say sure\nIf it delays it I mean that's what I'm saying they will take anything to delay this because they lay it through make it a political issue of the midterms\nUm they think that that's a benefit to them they're making that calculation that this is a political benefit for Democrats to continue this process on I think that it's the FBI's hands to what extent that does that but do not expect whatever they find even if it's positive for Brett Kavanaugh to influence a single Democrat ...\nBut we also know processed wise if that's what it is his nomination goes is that the Florida Senate now yeah to the for the ... FBI report you come out you've got but you've got to release the boat can be\n\nYeah so governed by Thursday I mean this is we're it's about ... territory said during the break for everybody who's on the air right now I mean it is it finished our first half hour this is this is not like there's some rule book for this exactly you know as the president just said in a press conference glitter while we're on the air um you know they're they're handling this Laos what the ... is requesting\nUh end of the White House has ordered it so it's it's not what Dianne Feinstein is requesting that what's what the Republican leaders they leave the Senate it's what they requested yeah\nWe've got a lot more ... we're going to be here for thirty minutes if you don't get the full hour the broadcasts discovered a Facebook periscope or a C. O. J. dental work screaming at live their television version of his broadcast and if you're on Facebook periscope and our other device and other social media\nPlatforms we don't take any rights we'll be talking about this during the break a radio audience course\nSure sects andme a number of other states and you got the full hour the broadcast [noise] hey we appreciate your support for the ACL Jay last month we met our must be pretty sure that again is ... makes a huge difference in age the L. J. doubt or for that one a C. L. J. down or we come back with a break and\nWhere to take more of your calls we've got one line open and that's it [noise]\nProbably not even that long but keep trying will guarantee one hundred sixty four thirty one ten back more just a moment\nIt's a critical time for nationwide I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for lunch on has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nMember and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional on religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now we see the OJ daughter\nNo not at that stage yet but I think those are the two likely here\nWell I tend to agree with Andy uh but the initial question was whether any additional evidence implicate him the nominee was presented a at the hearings last week and I think the answer to that question was no nonetheless the FBI\nOr is currently investigating the nominee and if the nominee is cleared by the FBI I think the nomination will indeed go forward\nAnd he will be confirmed but if there is a glitch or any ... too bad but then with respect to what the accuser has to lead them all ... of an incredible core Robert ... evidence the nominees a nomination will likely be polls yeah\nSo I don't think anybody anybody can give you an accurate\nYou know this is going to happen this is and I think it's like Jordan says I think right now it's fifty fifty yeah it could go to Seventy thirty if there's nothing there yeah I Do think it jumps the jumps considerably if there's nothing they already at this moment\nRight now it is fifty fifty because it's it's up to the what the FBI is able to find out what people are willing to say I mean listen it's still going to be people's words it's you're not going to find digital photos to her\nAt the time he so you've got to be people's words it's are there enough people's words or any bodies words to actually agree and corroborate the stories happen and if so I think that that number drops considerably if not um I I think that we're in a situation where yeah the the confirmation chance gets up to ... uh\nLike above sixty five to close to Seventy five percent chance back to the phones or we go Gail is calling from California online for hope we've got the name right get welcome to Jay Sekulow live ...\n... yes says it's ill my question is first of all thank you for all you guys are when you're doing a great job to keep us informed but my question is they're investigating Brett Kavanaugh are they also investigating the other side such as ... a letter from a from a ... office\nWell they're not leak they're doing that but I understand that the U.S Senate themselves are I think it was a Senator Tom cotton said\nThat they are calling for an investigation or who leaked the letter so that is something that's going on a ... what's the FBI's limitation here and he is the allegations that they focused on which are the two allegations Dr Ford missed from Eris\nThat's it that's what the White House has given them to do and that's what they're supposed to do they're not supposed to do anything else and they're supposed to report facts back to what it is to the White House and the White House then makes a decision income consultation I'm sure it with a majority leader\nAh we're taking your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten eight hundred sixty four three one ones Europe your Brett Kavanaugh team right now during what are you thinking and you know time is against you um but uh you're you're you are there's\nOnly so much you can battle against that now I I don't think there's too much thought to do I think that at best if they have to counter someone's statement to the FBI um they could try to do that by a again in punching the credibility of that witness\nA that being said anybody that we've seen come out and and also make negative statements about Brett Kavanaugh none have corroborated these specific events and they've actually denied any knowledge of any of these specific events so\nUm that I think it would be fatal to the Democrats are but we don't know I think that this is a big if you're on his favorite I mean this is now at the hands of the Senate\nIs out of the hands really are of ... since the White House yeah what the FBI comes back to the White House\nSo you're not thinking Andy and Harry if I'm the lawyer for Brett Kavanaugh if I was brought Kevin his lawyer what am I looking at I'm looking at one whether they have other witnesses whether those witnesses are cooperating someone else's Ramirez or Ford story and whether that cooperation is credible\nThat's exactly what you're looking at if you're looking at who else who are they what are they know and can they be believe that's right\nYeah apps him that he should go to the full it'll go to the floor of the Senate if there are ... if there were to be cooperating evidence on play the ... matter\nDo you think that's all I don't think it's good because I said you're going to lose more cash it in a ... like and you can go with and and no Democrats gonna vote for him because no Democrat wants to say you know wants to be said I put him across\nYeah Harry ... I think Andy is absolutely correct that if we have corroborating evidence against the nominee none of which is just that so far absolutely\nUh he will lose a couple of Republicans and no Democrats will come for to save his nomination because they will have political cover\nI keep saying it's not just cooperating evidence credible cooperating evidence they have to produce credible cooperating\nEvidence he can't just be yeah I I Know he was ready to go on and yeah but I mean literally and got to be I was at this event\nAnd the one that was accused of and yeah and I saw this happened\nI didn't even take a hearing about it is enough I think because of ... heard about it now\nLiterally every one of the country has heard about this uh right we also so uh uh the fact that you had to be there and see it I think for this or that cross the line now what does that mean we're talking about\nUm we're talking about a few a handful of votes that really matter at the end of the day\nMost mines are made up um if the Republican stick together that's enough you know I mean they don't need to get Joe mansion\nAnd I don't think Joe ... is going to save this Republicans if Lisa Murkowski or Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski oh or or college that decided to do something different I just don't ... you cannot rely on any Democrats to come to the rescue\nOf Brett Kavanaugh ... it's a it's so this is solely going to be a Republican decision let's be honest about it can Mitch McConnell um do what Chuck Grassley cannot which is keep the Republican majority together\nChuck Grassley unit chart on friday that majority was not there\nI mean could Jeff Flake said unless you do what I say I'm gonna vote no on this and it would've it would've been voted down in committee which technically doesn't stop it but I Would have been so ah\nJeff Flake was able to be in control this is a senator who's not even not even running for reelection retiring and he's a he's going out and make this after he made a statement saying it was ... he gets frustrated by the Democrats\nAfter he made a statement saying he was ... he gets frustrated by the Democrats that's why I don't trust anyone in the situation right now I'm the longer it goes on I think the tougher gets ... FBI report just comes back and makes them look foolish but now what we're going to see for them is that wasn't enough\nTo look into enough so it don't matter will be announced project like it should it should be but let's see he's he has to sit there for more hours and have people yelling at his face I'm someone who has no political\nA boat winter this he's done he's retiring so um he decided to put yourself out there this role which was kind of weird for someone retiring yup hum but he also I think a a has faced this onslaught for Democrats\nI mean they've got to be headed what if it comes to withdrawing the nomination or to be defeated what happens then will the president would\nGet the the way it would work is exactly what everybody said Mitch McConnell would make a call the president saying I don't have the votes and that does not appear to be the case right now we don't have the votes at that point normally would withdraw the nomination\nOr they could make a go forward a political grounds but if it's enough that they couldn't get the Republicans are I don't think they would and any president makes an listen under the constitution he makes another nomination that they will have another role of advice and consent we'll have been a justice Supreme Court term for a while\nBut you never great but that's just the ... that just the nature of what it is All right we're going to the last segment the broadcast we've got a couple of lines coming open here and there I'll give us a call at one eight hundred and sixty four thirty what's an even if you get a ... keep prying back\nWe'll try to get to calls on we've opened up a couple of lines for you at one eight hundred six eight or three one one zero to some questions on Facebook will get some new ones in the\nIn the hopper here some of them were were back on we're also going to get some race around the time when we come back and run you lose\nA historic move now the United states is December the in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf Israel and it's very right to exist leaves a lynchpin issues not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS among the law in Iran all pledged white Israel from the severe in his new book to your times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation\nDrew Sloan middle school and historical case where the Jewish capital presents clear your review of eleven\nTo remove any doubt about Israel's right to exist in the book do spells legal miss purported ...
