I mean that's they ... they called it their terrorism but they actually use in the indictment itself the word Christian as Asian\nYeah that's right I mean so what is actually it's ... it's unique is that when you went through the Turkish charging documents by the way didn't come out until march of twenty Eighteen after he was arrested and incarcerated in October of ... sixteen so no charges were filed against him until this year earlier this year and\nIn those charges a whole host of issues including what the book of revelation means and uh a tour and this term\nA charge of Christian ... is how it translated from Turkish so when you see these reports about what is terrorism what is uh what is espionage remember it's a government that is moving more Islam is a Christian nation would fit in those pretty extreme categories as kind of a takeover\nAttempt of a country that's predominately Muslim seats are you\nWorking with the United nations on this as well as with the are the lawyers in Turkey\nBut it it's it's it sounds bizarre to us that running a church that had about twenty five or thirty people and it would constitute a threat to the government but in the view of the Turkish authorities they weren't kidding when they thought they knew that it was it you\nAbsolutely it was a bargain political buying that we're not as what is that that's concerning is that it was a Christian station with literally his crime parents and an espionage we've heard those words the Christian nation is what turkey was paying\nElevated to that crime and he was simply a pastor pastor there for twenty three years but after the failed coup attempt in twenty six July twenty sixteen\nAnybody who was deemed an enemy when you know kinda got caught swept up in the park and that includes Christian\nSo the good news is is pastor Andrew Brunson is at home with his wife Noreen they were on some of the broadcast networks of this morning we're going to be joined with us in just a few minutes after we come back from the break and our phone lines are already jamming up a and we will take those calls when we come back at eight hundred six eight for three one one zero\nI'll be going we come back and break from pat my pastor Andrew Brunson your support and prayers for the past debate huge difference your support for the ACL Jay ... made a huge difference we mobilized our assets literally around the globe we had our offices in ...

something\nBoth will bring a current but what were you there as a mission\nCan I can I say something that we are so grateful to the people who pray for us and we're so grateful for a field day a such a tremendous job fighting for us\nAnd uh see the uh ... was tireless and advocating for us and you also J uh and for the the I Know she's a lawyer but she was also a personally involved to call them

the folks what you would be how long have you been there and what you were doing\nIn Turkey what was your call to go there\nWell we were there for twenty three years before I was arrested and our main goal was to uh go and priests to this Christ one of the main things we were involved in was church planting we're of all that several church plants\nAnd then in the last couple of years\nWhen there was a third of Syrian refugees because of the ISIS attacks since area a number of refugees came into turkey and we saw an opportunity not only to show the love of Jesus by helping them a humanitarian aid but also people who never had access to the gospel most Kurds have never met a Christian\nStanding with us you can make a tremendous difference in our country hand or culture\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAnd he's the OJ member today it's easy to just go online and sign up you know Jay on\n\nWhen we're joined by pastor Andrew Brunson were throw that happened the first time we've had him on a radio broadcasts\nObviously just out of a turkey and we're glad that he's home in the United states having said that I Know pastor your heart though is for the for the people of turkey and I'm sure that has not changed\nBut no we we still love turkey got this ... years ago and we are expecting that there will be a great artist in Turkey\nYep so you talked about the first year you said you were broken in January ... we've covered ear extensively you had a ... you were in a jail with twenty two people that was originally designed for eight or you had very harsh conditions are talking about the second year\nYeah so the first or feel like I was broken down and a shattered again and again and then the second year it's when I feel that God began to rebuild me\nAnd a lot of that happened uh just what small victories a big uh declaring truth declaring that God is with me\nUh I think of as a fifty ten became averse for me where a one were walking in the dark we hold on to our God\nSo I felt that I was walking in the dark and uh it was a time when God began to rebuild me slowly I wrote a song or I'm declaring has a lot for me and his faithfulness and especially focusing on the idea of endearing till the end and uh being faithful and that\nWell you certainly have been and and that's great see see I Know that we I remember in this very studio\nWhen we were first talking about those conditions are in the prison how cold it was on the number of people it was the people that this is an ear to Britain in anywhere is not great but you could imagine in a country like turkey or it's these are pretty awful conditions\nYeah it was very you know terrible condition and you know I was able to talk to you Noreen and during the legal process do you not to get help through what these steps are of course we didn't know what he was going to do\nThan as a Christian trying to get help ... you know even when you don't see it we have now the gods and now he's working in saying you know I Know the hard process and when you're in a Turkish printing to see what's the debt in that scene where so in that\nAnd that on Facebook says your testimonies incredible God Bless you passed the Bronx and you want to go yeah I I was going to ask a pastor Brunson a question about the people he was in prison when I used to spend on ABC News\nBut the idea that with some really rough people considering that you were so high profile\nI always wanted to underscore that to our us audience how high profile you weren't turkey like you said when the economy went bad when the two officials were saying should they blamed Andrew Brunson in Turkey or that they made you have to be this kind of super spy in the Turkish media\nAnd then you get put into jail cells with people a predominantly Muslim or who have read a ... a pretty salacious things about you\n[noise] well what happened is that\nUh at the beginning I wasn't high profile and they treated me they treated all of the other people are accused of being part of the coup attempt and being a part of the gay line that's movement which say it's basically an Islamist movement\nAnd so at the beginning of the difficulty I never complained about the physical conditions I was in\nA whether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was\nWhether it was crowded or cold or food or anything like that it was more that I was in prison [laughter] I'm deathly and the truth is that a lot of the people I was in prison with a word cube of being part of the Gila movement and there are police officers or military or\nA ... they were just very strong Muslims and the most difficult thing for me er during that time was a spiritual environment because they were all very committed very strong listen so there were constant prayers going on reputation of the Koran that was like a Muslim ... prayer twenty four seven\nUh and I was only Christian and I had no fellowship or\nAnyone to pray with so the the spiritual environment was difficult as I became more ... higher profile after President Trump asked for me at the summit that he hadn't made two thousand Seventeen than a than a couple of months they moved me from that sell\nTo a maximum to a higher security prison than I had been in a and put me in a smaller so with with just a two other people and the reason they did that was to provide more security so that people would not hurt me in any way so nothing what happened\nRight let's go right to most people are holding on to talk to pass the Bronx and Laura in North Carolina online find Laura welcome to Jason alive\nHey thank you I just want to thank you I really do a little nervous if it's your humble [noise] um [noise] and ah\nThank you for what you what you are you know I'm so glad that you're back I mean then praying for you\nThan not we can solve that come up I signed the thing on line that that they should not wind was not ... no\n[laughter] yeah incredible ... a nail down and praying for with uh our president\nYou let me ask you about that let me ask you about that one uh Andrew that was quite a moment I mean I'm I've been in that room on on many occasions but then that was certainly a different one what was your sense of that I mean I Know you wanted to do it you you prayed about it and I'm obviously the president was receptive tells me a little bit about that\n... had a dream about praying for President Trump a and specifically praying or words of Isaiah ... Holy Spirit by eleven\nAnd and her dream she uh she felt like there was resistance to it and she had the press through it that it was an important thing to do so she determined that if there was an opportunity to any point she met the president to pray these versus over him and when we learned that we would be going to the house the White House\nWe prayed together and we ask God to give us the opportunity to pray for the president we believe in our prayer we believe\nAlso and importation that as we pray for people got can\nA pass something spiritual onto a spiritual blessing on\nAnd so we we ask God to give it set up er tentative when we asked the president if we could pray for him he was very receptive\nAnd it was a great privilege for us to do this\nLet's say one more call before the break here Julie California on line six Julie you're on the air with pastor Brunson Julie\nI'm gay and Oregon after parent can custom all that's why I don't remember the hail today because they care about one individual and they care about that since the ... the whole world\nAnd passed up on her my question is pitching feel occur are so people around the world prank clean one person it's how how ... works for him to court e\nOkay so first I Want to say something about it so they said they they care about the individual and so my wife told me how cc would stay up sometimes through the night monitoring something for us the hearings and then the next day go through a whole day at work\nAnd just the personal care there was a really phenomenal uh uh the question I just forgot what the question\nWas you know no no the question was did you feel the prayers of God's people\nYou know I I was very encouraged knowing that people were praying for me one of the fears that I had it's an irrational think perhaps but when one is isolated the way I was is it I Would be forgotten that people would not pray for me and I desperately wanted that per because I I felt very weak\nAnd so uh as I look back uh on my second year of one guard was rebuilding me\nI didn't feel God's presence very much\nBut uh I I Know very well that it was a personal God's people that was a\nThere was a grave coming to me that often was not felt right it was like a hit and grace and I wasn't aware of it at the time but then I I Would look back and see well I came through these difficulties and I know that I'm too weak to do it myself you know I Know that it was great\nYou know you're absolutely right in by we're taking a break we'll come back with Sandra ... runs the moment but interesting statement when you said where you felt like you were alone and there were those times we we've had other cases where people say the exactly the same exact\nDay feel even though it's irrational they have no it's a rational need those situations there can be completely forgot I Will be back with more Andrew Brunson did just a moment\nIt's a critical time for nation in the world is so many challenges facing our country in the world to be American Center for Long Jones has never been more and more of them right now\nWe're engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family members and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional one religious freedom and\nYou can become a member of the the OJ on line up right now we see no during during\nCame out earlier when the lira went up and I should I mean even three weeks ago I said I'm a month ago I guess I said something about that we were encouraging the later they said and I think one of the reporters one of the ... of the financial magazines maybe CNBC I'm not sure said a secular made the statement and the lira came up selectively which was absurd in one sense\nBut it tells you how tied into the geopolitical do people donors this was a NATO ally with almost made it more complex right and it didn't make it more complex\nI Want people to also realize is that we've never had in many strengthening dates like that so bad precedent it worse I think being quick is because we had an inspiration State Department as Congress fully understand\nIf president was bleeding against and paying to send it\nTo the house right yeah I mean on a human ... I was gonna say the single biggest reason that this case ended in a positive manner and a quick reason is because of the most powerful nation in the world spoke with one voice in of course that was under the leadership of President Trump made authorized the vice president the secretary of state down the administrator or the executive branch\nOr to do so but Jay then you look at the impact in the United States Senate very bipartisan very biking really means yeah Jean Jean from New Hampshire who doesn't agree with the president on a lot of things one of the most vocal advocates in the United\nStates Senate ... Bronson and staff was very helpful to All right let's go ahead and take another call pastors back a Julie's\nCalling from Washington state on line to Julie welcome to Jay sexual live you're talking to a pastor Brunson Hi Julie go ahead\nOh praise the lord has standards and um then praying to what song is the beginning of the airplane and your name in there and it's so gratifying\nEncouraging and I'm Wondering about the uh missionary and about to go in there that are in there on what you can say to 'em about that and what about the people\nThat you are listening to them and how can we continue to pray for them\nThose people that you may be spoken to their lives far he were just a witness to I think he's still very much God Bless you\nFor your call Julie such a good question pass or one of his advice for those that are there and and also those that are left behind that that you minister to\nVote one reality for people who are going into ... says and I but not just for missions I think are increasingly here in the states\nThat there is going to be a price to pay a to stand for truth\nAnd ah it's actually something very normal and the Bible is through the that we can expect opposition and that there will be persecution\nAnd so it's not just for missionaries but for people in the states as well as it stands for God and that society they're going to be people who will ah persecute a for what was the second part of the questions\nThat you want to know what I'm for those that are are still there doing missionary work or what advice would you have rhythm\nOkay\nI I think here's the IRS that well here's what she's really trying to get to their armed people there in Turkey right now that we know are sharing the gospel we know that you were arrested for sharing the gospel you were charged with crushes Asian when we got an indictment and rent it and it said Christians Asia as a form of terrorism we we all say that was absurd\nBut there were people you were mastering too that were impacted by your ministry in Turkey are their shepherd to take care of them they're\nA okay yes and are are part of a yes or how how do we also are pray for people who who\nYou know this ah right now there is increasing as long as they send in the country and uh there were seeing something very interesting that wasn't happening two years ago this now there are many people coming into the church and saying I Am no longer wanting to be among some I'm now at this\nSo I'm believe in God but I don't I I Want to know how do I find him so I think there are increasing numbers of people and this is something that God is going to use difficulties in the country I think that\nAre in the ... and and this time I had as as things become more difficult for the church in Turkey a ... for people in general that more and more people will turn away from Islam and we'll begin to turn a well to look for ... yeah\nAll right let's go ahead more questions Brian calling from Arizona on line for Ryan welcome to the broadcast you're talking to pass the Bronx I ride\nA yes thank you thank you so much and a pastor Brunson that prayer was just so humble and symbols which made it so powerful um when you do that with the president [noise] my question um you you block the Holy Spirit up there and I was just wondering you know when Jesus\nLeft he said I leave you an advocate you were not an orphan and I'm sure that that uh you felt like in or friends\nAt times during that a jail sentence and I was just wondering where one of the bigger doubts that transform a weakness to his strength using the spirit that was a revelation for you in a crisis\nWell I I you know at some point I'm going to write a book and I go into this because they're actually complicated questions but I questioned ah\nGod's personal love for me faithfulness or why he would leave me in a situation like this when I Love him at a dedicated in my life to serving him and ... and these are the\nQuestions at the heart more than of the mind sometimes just from the emotions\nAnd I found that I had to declare the truth and so I wrote a song in prison and one of the lines of Jesus the faithful one who loves me always good and true so that was a declaration of the things that I was doubting\nAnd I determined it doesn't matter what I feel or what my doubts are I Am going to speak the truth about gods character and this was part of the the some of the victories that I had step by step in and and restoring strength to me was a declaring truth declaring God's character\nLet's go ahead and take John's calling when we can get us and before the break John calling from Minnesota you're on the air with pastor braids on quickly please\nBalls that I just want to say that I think it captures the heart of America are not very many people there ... there were a president to say about his costs are so I just lost to play for you in the in the theater for you\nSo I'll end up just loves to play for you in the in the future you why why why they ask you one question what can you say to the persecuted church in Florida so that you know national day up so that by quest to do last July cost to\nWhat about you what would you be your word to the persecuted church pastor\nBut there's very little that I can say that the church in China they're the ones who teach us but what I Do know that God is going to use China to bless the world and they are the next big missions sending there's going to be a wave of Chinese going out into the Muslim world\nAnd they are going to carry much of the weight of the missionary movement so I expect great wonderful things from China\nWere coming up on the last segment with pastor Brunson so I encourage you to keep going keep getting your comments in France said I
