the lead attorney\nOn the Bronx in case a is joining us in Studio and she was with the family that actually it at joint base Andrews when the plane landed with a brunch since uh arrived in the United states I was with him at the White House in the oval office when uh the brunt since\nUh met with the president and and other major leaders of the United states as well as when pastor Brunson now to in prayer but they were private moments as well ah so cc let me go first to you and just to explain to people what it was like for the Bronx is to find a we touched down on us soil\nAnd every time there Wyoming and it's a very emotional down then I was I'm In DC but not too far with the children on ... making arrangements for Andrews Air force base and\nThe children on the ... making the arrangements for Andrews Air force base and um you know when they first announced that the plane was arriving we all went out to greet the plane and\nAt the door open and we watched a pastor Brunson and his wife marine walk off that plane um it was I don't think there was a dry there between and obviously the children myself um it was it was extremely emotional that's two years of a hard fought battle coming to an end\nThen these sort of comes off the plane and and what was that experience like who was it the who was there at joint base Andrews\nIt was just literally his uh three children and and jak one is married ... son in law myself and then on the reins brother so brother in law\nAnd then you make your way to the White House\nWe did we had just a little bit of time on at Andrews and then we went for the meeting on in the oval office with the president\nFairly overwhelming ... meaning that we saw on television ah I've gotten the outer meet with President Trump in the oval office it's it's a unique experience for for anyone in any American but ... for what we saw me ... there was quite a quite a group of leaders in that room yeah I did have started that way to start that way actually\nDead I'm actually ... past trained her and the rain had a chance to meet with the president did separately yes for the right and so they had a meeting in and the children and I met with um the all the congressman says Senate and representative that had worked so hard on us and now it's a great time to just think and and for all of their efforts\nSecretary palm pay with their um\nAnd the ongoing fight for free\nAn ACL gene member today\n\nI Know the OJ daughter\n[noise]\nShe thinks I'm here now and I do remind people pastor Andrew Brunson will be joining us live tomorrow on Jay Sekulow directly\nFrom him about this experience ... is our clients or they get a a victory for the brunt since uh for the ACL Jay for all of our supporters a that a Christian pastors released and thank you too though again I said it before but it says\nA number of media interviews but to thanks to the administration the President Trump vice president Pence secretary of state ... numbers of member of the U.S Senate\nHouse representatives and I think that they saw what they saw pastor Brunson a meal\nAnd pray for the president in the oval office just twenty four hours after having a stable bracelet taken off\nAnd be given his passport back and freed from turkey\nAnd can find but um they realized that everybody was doing the right thing and working for the right person to release and it was worse to all of the effort or from your part from our effort the ACL Jay from those members of Congress in of course all the way up to the president of the United states and his administration\nTalking about uh as far as the United states tore Florida Today some of the damage the devastation that was done by the hurricane then he'll be and he's as you continue to be out on the campaign trail and the mid term elections just twenty two days away tomorrow marches three weeks\nUntil election day we're taking your phone calls on that one eight hundred six eight four thirty one one eight hundred sixty four thirty one to take my question to you\nAre you feeling the shift to Republicans that the polls are showing\nAre are you seeing this and now you're districts you know every member of Congress is up for re election as somebody who live in very red places some lives in very blue but even if some of those states um a lot of Tennessee for instance where it appeared and they're still ... ... may well be a competitive Senate race\nOr going on new polls are showing the Republican Marsha Blackburn where they fourteen point lead\nThis the first time there been any kind of all this is triple\nA the leads a three times the lead she's had any previous poll over the former governor of Tennessee Phil Bredesen is trying to run as a moderate Democrat at the effectively has been shown to\nUh be more like a Doug Jones in Alabama that will look a may act a certain way but not probably vote a certain way um ... we saw that because it was exposed that\nWhile he would vote for a judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court then I came out his age you know we're telling people out he was just say that for politics a that was just too you know to get elected\nEver work well for candidates let me write to than but in Washington DC because than we are seeing pole shifting it does seem like I don't know if I'd call a red way\nBut I think you said somebody report in our morning meeting which is that in every race or across the country Republicans are doing better than they were it not that they're necessarily now jumped twenty point leads but they are improving and the Democrats are either stagnant or dropping\nJordan I mean you look at all of these races in of course they all start in different places right in one in one race the Republican might start ahead by ten points in the polls in or in another race the Democrat might start ten points ahead but over the last couple of weeks if you track the trends in the polling and all of these races are virtually all of them have moved\nAttracted trends in the polling and all of these races are virtually all of them have moved a in a in a marked amount toward the direction of the Republicans would that Republican there was up ten is now at fourteen that Democrat who was up ten is now only up six\nNot every race has had as dramatic as a turn as we've seen in Tennessee Jordan I Do think a thrill Phil Bredesen was really hurt by the exposure\nOf of his is coming out in in support of judge Kavanaugh and then his age behind the scene and he\nWould not have voted for him and in the end I think that's why Marsha Blackburn has picked up a considerable amount of support during their actually a number of local forecasters\nThat have ... now move that from a toss up race to a lean Republican race um look I'll I'll put it this way unless Democrats are able to pick up that seat in Tennessee or maintain Heidi Heitkamp seat in North Dakota\nThere really is no path to them to be the majority in the United States Senate even if they would sweep of this so called tossup\nA racist Jordan that would still leave the Republicans with fifty seats if they pick up Tennessee and North Dakota and of course vice president Pence will be the tie breaking vote so just to answer your bottom line question yes the polling across the country has moved towards the Republicans now you just kind of have to look where they started\n... know folks out our political clean gage were twenty two days out from the election argue volunteering are you getting involved in campaigns locally you involved in a sit in a campaign I'd love to hear from you folks to see your level of engagement in this process and do you feel what\nThe polls are showing that there is a move towards Republicans ... again different in each state different each\nRay over\nWelding to appoint twenty says that you say oh it's a done deal Democrats can't take back the house I don't think we're at that point\nAt all and should not yeah uh it any way kind of believe that but I really want to know from you how involved you are in these campaigns ah one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten and do you sense that President Trump big out on the campaign trail uh it is helping these Republican candidates and potentially\nA preserving Republican control of your question it which is dangerous to explain pretty difficult than we can get into that even more of the second half but it's pretty difficult for Democrats right now\nBased off all the polling uh but we can even maintain control of the house of representatives something than a that obviously people thought it was impossible just weeks ago yeah 'cause it certainly has\nEndured I mean usually the house of representatives is the first one that will sort of\nA flip it as the American people look for divided government just historically speaking in of course the Republicans control every level a lover of government here in Washington DC right now let's just look at some of the numbers the Republicans have most recently Jordan one to two hundred and forty\nOf the houses four hundred and thirty five seats now there are some vacancies so there's only two hundred and thirty five sitting Republicans right now but if you boil it all down\nThe Democrats need to flip a twenty three seats to get to a majority in the house of representatives and Jordan the historical data says that that is a lower than add reimbursed\nFor the first ... first mid term of a president's election the other party usually gets more that however\nThe polling data we just talked about in the United States Senate that's actually proven true on the house side as well now obviously it's a lot more granular you're talking about district sensitive states\nCandidates really really matter and I would say a national wave is probably less impact will in the house that it is and some other places are but I I think if you're the Republican Party in Washington DC a month ago\nYou probably would have conceded that the Democrats were most likely maybe in a private moment you would have conceded to the Democrats were most likely to take over the house or Jordan I think most both parties would now tell you if they were being honest\nThat there's a real fight on your hand this one could really go either direction\nElizabeth on Facebook writes in Jordan or polls dependable some more than others I like how real clear politics does it they do an average of polls ah she could see the latest polls but also you know what came out of four days before that\nAnd different polling groups um ultimately they just kind of give you a sense of a race is there a total blowout happening in a race and then I should should resources be shifted somewhere else has something signal each page\nObviously if three more polls come out Marsha Blackburn with a forty point leads instead of five or six point lead something significantly change in the voters that are being contacted by the polls\nBut let me remind everybody out there that mid term elections are all about turnout it it is very different than trying to pull 'em a presidential election uh\nAnd and then you mentioned just in North Dakota for instance that Heidi Heitkamp maybe down twelve points in the latest poll and it might not be moved to a lean GOP re she's the incumbent Democrat Senator voted against Brett Kavanaugh a lot of people thought that may be the end of her political career you said it's just a few hundred thousand votes that will be cast that day\nYeah twelve percent is not the same in North Dakota as it is say California only gonna be three hundred and twenty five thousand votes cast\nOr so and the entire state of North Dakota Jordans or just a few thousand votes can eat into that twelve percent lead\nVery very quickly yes you see how [noise]\nGet out the vote efforts to take your ... from down ten in a state like North Dakota to to victory\nIf you if you got the people on the ground and the resources to do it we've got a second half hour coming up we got one phone line open we are talking politics one eight hundred six eight four thirty one to that one hundred sixty four three one zero we'll be right back on Jay secular life for all the information about pastor Andrew Brunson go to a C. O. J. dot org we'll be right back\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for lunch or has never been more important\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom or\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ\nLawn lawn sign up right now I see oh gee\nFor the Republicans and it sure looks like right now Republicans are pretty heavy favorite in North Dakota which would again\nPut them at that fifty vote threshold and give them a majority your nets before you get to any of the other nine seats that Donald Trump won or just two years ago that are currently being defended\nBy Democrats so look I think I I think getting to fifty for Republicans is probably something that they're going to accomplish I think they're going to be in the majority of the look on the other end of the spectrum I think Republicans are hoping for fifty five fifty six fifty seven seats something like that\nYeah I mean you look at um Arizona and mix Sally ... there's a Republican\nI'm as been it's been very very close who within a point there's one poll show you six point lead\nOr for the Republican there but it's very very close all within the margin of error\nIn Arizona and then you look to one of those states President Trump won a where you've got the comment or a Claire McCaskill a who again and most of the polls are showing a tie or a statistical tie even if it's a point for one way for ... how the Republican challenger or for the other way I mean these are again\nRight on the margins are and it is is that we're talking about in that in that case in Missouri a Democrat seat that I could flip we're talking about in places like North Dakota a democratic seat or they could flip it then you look at the others like open seats were Republican and like Arizona\nAgain and so there's there's plenty of data to go through and it all I think as we get closer to election day\nIt gets clear and clear for everyone who's paying close attention if you are we want to hear from you\nHow ... is pretty simple how do you think Republicans and the president's party\nWill fare on election day\nIn a on November sex for twenty two days out give us a call ... hundred six eight four thirty one that's one eight hundred six eight for three one zero do you believe people are paying attention our neighbors so you're uh people uh you go to church with and they're starting to pay attention\nAbout these races give us a call one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten I Want to hear about it from the ground what you are picking up what you're hearing what you are experiencing Roger's calling from Virginia on line three Raj welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nThank you for saying we received from God absolutely nation to have like the thing\nThat is a tip that took to focus\nA cat [noise] even mentioned about this about me speaking to politics I Hope they didn't even know that\nLast cast on the station is going to Christian Community at large be sold mine did you see this as a kid\nThey can't do it\nBecause it would have gone to a situation which is based on that political God does is it could be involved in this venue I support my vote in this\nParticular location in which\nCase legion you have is encased\nIn D.C to open seats at large so\nThat part they were just talking to those to see if I can seats for that is one in which the dos and it gets one vote to make a difference between a majority of the house and we can you show all the things\nWe have to have consciousness and your and your team you done it it\nKind of keep thinking appreciate that I think you know listen I mean I think this is a time for people to get engaged wherever wherever you are in the country are these you've got a congressional race going on at a minimum at a minimum and and certain likely more but every member of Congress is up for reelection in the house of representatives remember that\nAnd uh in the U.S is thirty five races going so again I mean this is this impacts are so many of us if you want to talk to some of the one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten or what are you seeing like what are you picking up as you are I'm In your communities at talking to people whether it's at ... work\nI'm at church or at your own family or just even though like the local news the candidates themselves so you said seeing a change moving back towards a Republicans I Know in some places listen you're not going to see that\nAnd other places all you're ever going to see is is a Republican so there's there's obviously places like that but\nFor those of you who may be in or near a those swing districts we love to hear from you and uh and who follow the news closely one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tend to talk to us on the other one eight hundred and sixty four three one zero Jesse is calling from California on line five Jesse welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nI I just took a first of all I Want to encourage all the Christian\nOut there to just be praying and make sure you get out and vote because all these victories make no mistake the coming from the artist the Lord's hands its blessing our nation right now but I'm I'm In California and um I've seen\nA lot of people say for cops like he has a real shock over here in California I even had friends that were hard core Democrats\nFor for our audience who aren't in California that's a good Republican candidate for governor running against new some\nAnd I had friends that were anti Trump that ice to argue with the ... they used to have trouble with a passion and now they're even say you know we got a Mitt he's doing a good job and they're voting for costs because everybody because everybody knows gab and she looked at fiscal but it's cool it's like the worst city in\nCalifornia he ran into the ground so imagine what he'll do all with all of California so I've seen a lot even from Democrats saying that they're going Wilcox\nYou never know and be California detour elections I mean certainly Democrats are favored state wide and California and then he raised when it's a statewide race but there have been you know Republican governors in the recent past Arnold Schwarzenegger one of them in a again they they can get competitive in these kind of election years in power\nThe ... again they they can get competitive in these kind of election years in politics has changed significantly\nSince President Trump's election I mean let's just remember I think it changed a lot with President Obama's election\nAnd then a change she can if he'll eat with President Trump's election as well and then all of the house seats in California that or play a for Republicans that are important for ... to ... for any way for Republicans to keep control the house of representatives it does that mean I think that I think both bases\nHave something to get excited about a a and B to say no we focused on the conservative side to make sense because\nWe were in that movement more I think to me to to talk too much about what's happening on the left is just not fair uh because I'm not a really a very inside that movement now what it does appear like is there's a lot of anger\nAnd there's a lot of I don't like this person or I don't like this I don't see so much\nAbout the candidates themselves there's a ... or ... gets a lot of play but again the polling not looking great for him again turnout matters so it could be a close race for Ted Cruz a but but but ultimately I mean those are just a handful the knaves seems like and that's important uniting\nAround candidates is important to actually when I'm just being against things is typically not enough not in the midterms there's the bigger picture which is the ... that were\nAgainst the war one or\nIdeology of the political parties to put it in a very kind of had the most mildly but but then you've got to actually liked the candidates and that's what drives you to actually show up on election day even if it's raining it's bad weather even if you've got you know you've got other than\nThat it's a work day there's a line so that's what gets you there ought to lecture date twenty two days now we come back\nWe'll take more your phone calls
