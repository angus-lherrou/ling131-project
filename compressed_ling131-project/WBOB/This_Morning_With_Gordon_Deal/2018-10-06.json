a floor vote\nWashington DC Jay Sekulow lie under\nThe age of fifty one the nose are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nPhone lines are open for your questions right now call one eight hundred sixty four three one zero today\nAs a pivotal and the nomination process a\nTrial judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the ...\nWell the idea of justice served our nation\nWell the idea of justice that have served our nation oil for so long\nFor all and ... and\nNow your host Jordan Sekulow we can explain this very easily for you\nWhich is the first hurdle has been overcome by Brett Kavanaugh it he moves on to a full Senate vote that will likely occur tomorrow evening that would be Saturday evening we're alive right now talking to you\nAll are to break it down is if you you're asking well who voted which way I can do it a very simple way every Republican voted for Brett Kavanaugh or on cloture so not yet on his nomination but for cloture except for Lisa Murkowski every Democrat\nVoted against cloture on Brett Kavanaugh except for Joe Manchin so literally only to\nA senators one Republican breaking from her party Lisa Murkowski one Democrat breaking from his party Joe mansion what does this mean well this vote does not mean that they have to vote the same way\nWhen the confirmation vote comes up tomorrow so uh we do know that Susan Collins is prepared to have a press conference later today after we're off the air or about how she will vote\nOr Lisa Murkowski just put out a statement she was the no vote that she changed her mind as she walked into the chamber I'm\nKind of assuming right now because she was a no vote on culture it's unlikely that she would then be a yes vote\nOn the nomination but she is very close with Susan Collins we'll see what Susan Collins has to say\nI is still very much up in the air this was fifty one to forty nine that didn't require the vice president to cast a vote but um we are within the margins of just you know losing um again if you lose another up if you assume that Lisa Murkowski is a no\nAnd you lose another Republican\nYou would have to have Joe mansion be the sole Democrat to come and say this nomination so that vice president Pence could cast a fifty first vote that is putting a lot on one the only Democrat so far who voted yes on cloture to actually be the vote\nThat that confirmed basically Brett Kavanaugh I Want to take your phone calls on this one hundred sixty four thirty one to let's get a lot of reports from Washington DC and than\nThis is far from over a certainly it's a it's a positive your Kavanaugh supporter to move forward or without the need for vice president Pence to cast a vote that being said razor thin margin is fifty one to forty nine on cloture\nWhich usually gets more votes than ... than the confirmation because of the idea that nominees deserve an up or down vote\nAnd we saw a Republican defections\nYeah we said yesterday on the air Jordan at the cloture vote in the final vote might not necessarily near each other and we also said that it was going to take two of the three undecided Republicans to get\nA judge Kavanaugh over the line and then if he did get over the line you might see a Democrat or to uh come his way and that's exactly how it played out look I don't I don't know where Joe Manchin vote would have been Jordan had it not been for Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting yes since they were yes as he was free to vote yes that pushed the task to fifty one\nBut I think he laid it out right look we're going to hear from Susan Collins what her final decision is at three o'clock\nUm we don't we haven't heard from Jeff Flake would his final decision is a Jordan in order to be assured of confirmation for judge Kavanaugh I think both of those two a need to be yes has now maybe Joe Manchin would cast the deciding vote but I think that would be a pretty perilous place\nOr for the nomination to be but look bottom line today Jordan there were all Timothy for votes throughout this whole process the judge Kavanaugh had to get through\nHe's now through three of them he has one vote away from sitting on the Supreme\nCourt justice Steve on Facebook writes Jordan chances Kavanaugh's confirmed but I think there's a good chance he is confirmed but this is far from over because at the margins are so\nI mean I think anybody who could tell you right now one hundred percent especially with Susan Collins who voted yes on culture but this is going to have a press conference to tell you more about how a vote on the actual nomination tomorrow and I'm going to have that this afternoon\nThat throws everything up there once again\nGive us a call one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one tenth the Kavanaugh nomination we're heading towards the final

J. dawn\n[noise]\nTo get right into the sauce people than hold on already called right in the beginning of the show I Want to answer very quickly because people do just joined us throughout the broadcast\nOr Jamie on Facebook what was the vote count on culture fifty wad to forty nine ah fifty one ... votes that leads to comment on the nomination cultures have votes debate there's a thirty hours a debate that's already started on the Senate floor that's where the sitters get their time to talk\nAnd they had a final vote likely not by the way that plays out would be to borrow a early evening could be pushed back of course they could keep those votes open\nA but sometime tomorrow evening that Saturday evening says fifty one forty died just to make it clear one Republican voted against a culture on Brett Kavanaugh that was Lisa Murkowski all the other Republicans voted yes\nIn one Democrat voted yes for cloture\nOn Brett Kavanaugh that was Joe Manchin all the other Democrats voted no she only had two defections on from party line up for the party lives a one on each side one Republican one Democrat or we will go right to the phones that one eight hundred six eight for\nA thirty what Ted Stevens called the from Texas all lie to Stephen welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nI appreciate your taking my call I'm thankful that you're supportive of religious freedom and I'm incredibly grateful for your support of Israel\nAnd Jeff Flake is conducting himself as if he's bulletproof since he's not running for another term I mean what does he got to lose some questions does he have did you have a security clearance that he would normally carry forward and trade on\nThat can be withdrawn if the president feels he's conducted himself in the way the damages our country\nThat senators the that is for what they did he kind of clear they have would be for the time they are elected officials\nAre chosen by the people so it's not like government official bureaucrats who have gone through\nBut multiple process to get there are so that would that be an indication listed a it does make it more difficult with Jeff Flake is it not up for reelection he was already going to have it a possible primary in Arizona people were not real happy with him at what really what he became was a senator or that kind of moved to the middle\nOf throughout his career certainly felt felt that way I'm even by his votes ads out\nThat's why it's still a bit of a concert here now he said he's still a yes he plans to be a yes vote unless something else happens that was literally his statement after the cloture vote\nFor me that's very typical Jeff Flake statement at this point than and also what kind of concerts we'd because so much can happen and what I guess we're probably got twenty nine hours left now\nDuring the ... what are you said before the committee mark up he said I'm a yes and Jeff Flake and then there was four hours between the time he said that in the boat was cast\nAnd as we all know he initiated this one week to life so I agree with you that say tenuous statement of support here here's what my I think my message to Jeff Flake would be ... back when you negotiated this one week to lay what you said is that you wanted to see this additional FBI reports\nAnd if there was nothing additional cooperating that came out of it than you are going to be a yes and then just yesterday you said that there was nothing\nA new new cooperating information inside the report so I think the pitch to to Jeff Flake Jordan is not really a political one it's one of will you be a man of where did you mean it when you said that and now that you've got what you wanted with this one week uh FBI investigation will you follow through\nAnd now that you've got what you wanted with this one week uh FBI investigation will you follow through I think that's the pitch that people who support judge Kavanaugh she'd be making adjust like\nTracy's call in from Virginia on line one Tracy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\n[laughter] hey there I think my question was answered by Kevin ... op ed that yeah when I was like you know as you say you're going to do\nIs he still gonna want this convention after all said and done\nI I absolutely and I mean all said and done is going to be the next thirty hours less than thirty hours from now so he used to watch this he he could have ... if he thought this was too much that would have been done earlier in the process\nNow you got to cloture votes you're moving towards the final vote yes things could change on um you know if they feel like they've lost a lot of votes do you pull it up but I'm ... I mean these are very hypothetical that has nothing to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh wants to position he certainly does he took another unprecedented step like do we a TV interview\nLike having to come back to testify not about judicial philosophy but uncorroborated allegations against him\nNow he's written an op ed that appeared yesterday the wall Street Journal I treated out immediately I posted to my Facebook page immediately let me just read a a a little bit from it or to make it clear but it is clear he wants his position\nAs I explained during the hearing a a good judge Buffy the vampire a neutral impartial arbiters who favors no political party litter get or policy\nAs Justice Kennedy the state of judges that make decisions to reach a preferred result over the past twelve years I've ruled sometimes for the prosecution sometimes for criminal defendants sometimes for workers at some times for businesses sometimes for environmentalist sometimes for coal miners in each case I followed the law\nI Do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences about a pro plaintiff\nOr pro defendant judge I've got a pro prosecution or pro defense judge I'm a pro law judge\nAnd he goes on since Supreme Court must never be viewed as a ... institution I'd encourage you to read the entire op ed he talks about why he was so emotional as well he says I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been thinking about that statement from Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that's likely true based of everybody that does break capital well is that the emotional as he he he's ever been especially in a public setting\nA you know not behind closed doors but the public\nI might have ... I Know my total sharp but I said a few things I probably should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son\nHas been and dad\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad\nMy wife and most of all my daughter's so that again I encourage you to read the entire off into the wall Street Journal I tweeted out post on my Facebook page it's an op ed that was written by judge Kavanaugh I'd appeared or just yeah it was published yesterday at this again because he knew that the phase three attack\nWas not about the allegations\nBut temperament and as I read to you I told us they listen for the works to prevent it appears in uh all these no votes statements city to city or Heidi Heitkamp which I think she's good by North Dakota or the Washington Post editorial board that says to vote no uses to prevent a New York times editorial board just called him a jerk\nOr they're very uh I get very uh\n... it's just a bit of ... these are the kind of terminology et cetera Feinstein a angered aggression is how she explains that Schumer uses temperament Durban uses ... Doug Jones' Alabama uses temperament so does Patrick Leahy plenty of others have as well as just kind of\nA sample for you as well this is a good ... what company from Facebook you talked with Saudi and wanting hundred six eight four thirty one too that twenty eight hundred six eight for three one zero I uh which stood on Facebook I'm surprised that sitter jokes from Alabama voted no on culture\nThan Doug Jones just showed everybody that uh you could get an Alabama senator and a Democrat or that he is he's got to be voting with the Democratic party a so long as he's a U.S Senate\nYeah he's been joined that for a while and I mean honestly he was never really in play on this one and he has not been on play on a lot of key pieces of legislation as well as on the nation's um\nYou know I I guess I Would read the political tea leaves on that a little bit maybe Doug Jones doesn't think he as much of a chance for reelection so he doesn't have to play or to the base in Alabama I'm not quite sure but I Would just I Would just say this I don't think this is the first indication from Doug Jones I think this is a pretty much more of the same of what you've been getting from him since he's been in town not\nListen to him today on CNN by Nineteen\nThere you go for Doug Jones is the temperament issues faced three the question is is space three successful [noise]\nIt's a question because the cloture vote was so close to that is just the vote to allow a final vote\nAnd just because you vote to allow it up or down vote does not mean you also we're going to vote affirmatively for nominee\nThe fish out of the first half hour that you should always allow it up or down vote [noise] I'm not but again this was fifty one forty nine back our second half hour on the line\nIt's a critical time for our nation and for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country in the works for the American Center for launches has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now we see el ... daughter\nA Fort Bragg capital and it puts him in easier situation so he gets to tell us constituents I voted yes and I do think that helps them I mean I'll be honest because most ... most of his constituents\nAre not going to break it down to well did he do that because he was it didn't it didn't really matter or not they're going to see it ultimately as a a yes vote now it would be different if he is the deciding vote I'm a I think he could probably politically use that to his advantage in West Virginia\nIf he so chooses but they'd have to also didn't determine what could happen to his Democrat or support however base that is there a for him um and what may happen from national party as well so I I think just to answer your question\nThat most people don't get to say that it's so stupid it's just how educated you are up to speed on this and this is this is splitting hairs yeah this is\nComing down to well did this vote actually ... was the vote that mattered I mean technically they are all votes that matter would you add them up I mean you got to get to fifty one but it's what you were talking about the single individual Democrat voted pushes over\nThe top and she could see again I appreciate our audience you see the great questions that come from our audience because you are all very well informed and tell you ask the questions to take another one of those right now one hundred sixty four\nThirty one to that is one eight hundred six eight for three one zero to talk to us on the air Cathy calling from Arizona online for Kathy welcome to Jay Sekulow alive\nHow dare I think he taking my call Cathy\nI just wanted to say I think it ... very disheartening and that the constituents back home that don't have the means to travel to Washington in it because of money who work\nOn that we can't be there and look at a flake mccaskey or whomever right before they go in to vote and let them know hey that's that's what the people back home are wanting you to do it\nSo I guess when they say you know please I keep them all in prayer um I Want and God to influence them and that cat please remember that people who are not just the squeaky wheels that gets you traveled to Washington\nYeah you know I've been involved in some of these a larger kinda ... whether you call them protester events in Washington DC on the mall and usually those um work accompanied by approach a protest or Vince whenever you want to call it\nThat were happening all over the country so that you could say it's not just here in Washington but it was happening everywhere and this was a sample there'd be thousands of people in Washington but there'll be thousands of people in Atlanta Georgia and uh you know in Phoenix, Arizona I'm as well\nBut here we are seeing as one Washington is a Democrat base and so the surrounding area so it's very easy to get the activists on board to the groups are pouring money into getting this confrontation\nI don't really see it by the way I'm not really endorsing this this idea either of Republican or conservative groups um funding people to confront\nAn aggressive way US Senators are in ways also with the potential uh uh put yourself in in jeopardy of being arrested it just doesn't seem to really add up to the values\nOf the more conservative and Republican move but that doesn't mean you give up your right to protest or let your voices be heard this is just started up a kind of a left this way I think it's unfortunate that they have had\nThe kind of influence they have had a because it is such a limited amount of people that we're not seeing protests are up to all over the country than I mean it is is Washington it's pretty easy for the left to put together a protest\nYeah and I would say two things Jordan first of all of this is why do you see all day exist I mean this is why we put petitions out on any number of issues we can be your voice here in Washington DC that's why we break it down state by state and show the senators\nWho in their state is interested in a given topic and the second thing I Would say Jordan um I I can tell you from first hand experience I think calls into senators' offices\nOr make about as much impact as those as those protesters those events do and\nAnd I mean and this particular case I think there are number of undecided senators that are out there or they could still be called I mean if you're in the in the states for our senator colon cinder flake or senator Manchin and you can't get to Washington DC I Would say pick up the phone and call their office and let them know what you think about the judge\nAll right let's try and grab another call one eight hundred and sixty four thirty one to the children today\nAre we're not we're going to wait to the final thing with the broadcasts to try to take a lot of calls because so many people to hold on like Deborah Arizona online six I'm also been hold on a ... you to hang on after your comment or question and I want to make sure we get you one of our books as well thanks for holding on\nAnd they protect taking my call and he talked about you're listening and for him but I thank you for informing us than I Want something that balance and truthful and not you know\nI Try to catch your show on Sirius Radio so I appreciate you guys as well as gasoline that's supported Israel\nI only true for a selfie them\nAnd I can read what other people is that and unfortunately Senator Flake is just like his name is a flake always hard and but I Know what I did was I think that my phone and and called his office and I'm One of your constituents is\nYou know you represent us and I'm thinking about not just Kenny he supposedly has political aspirations after the\nSenate has some of these other people that are sitting on the phone and it doesn't help the fled their phone lines as well\nYeah I think that was I think that their phone lines are being flooded\nUm I'm not really the position right now I don't think I Need to give up the number because I think that what we've been checking in basically these phone lines for these key senators are are pretty flooded that makes it as a constituent like you'd never absolutely if your constituents Jeff Flake if you're a constituent\nOf a Susan Collins or if you're a constituent of Joe mansion you absolutely\nUh have have the right and and if you have the time to pick up the phone call the ... you know the other side is doing right now\nUm and again I think that we can be limited in this I think that most senators are made up their mind\nUh but uh but again there are those handful remaining a Jeff Flake certainly is one of those who is still not been clear a he's kind of said I I play the vote yes tomorrow so that's what he said unless something else uh is to occur twenty eight twenty nine\nSaid unless something else that is to occur\nTwenty eight twenty nine hours or for something else to occur uh uh that ... for Jeff Flake that can be just be convinced by someone like Chris ... um so you get a pretty open ended statements\nAnd will not be nasty you know so we want these people to vote in a positive way so I get I'm not going to cast aspersions on them uh I Do think that they you could say that they have been these are a sitter to put themselves out in this position\nBy publicly take euros that they are undecided or just feel like they're going to vote yes but they're not a hundred percent I'm at a stand up or down our chat that if you can't get to the D.C office called their stayed off especially if you're a constituent if you live in Arizona kick it to the D.C office for Jeff Flake calls Arizona office\nAs well who got a minute left or the second we come back we will focus all on your phone calls which I think it'd be great for everybody listening to um I Know that everybody can call into the show but it kind of focused to get on\nA key\nIssues [noise] these fight or [noise] ... breakdown in his final hours before you devote to either I put a jets for judge Kavanaugh to become justice capital for ah for for a judge nominees to the Supreme Court to be voted down [noise]\nBelieve judge Kavanaugh should become justice Kavanaugh that's my personal opinion\nI support his nomination\nMutt it hangs in the balance and we just have
