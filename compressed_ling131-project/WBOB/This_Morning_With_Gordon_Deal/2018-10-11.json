Kelly calling from Montana on line one Kelly welcome to Jay sexual alive I Kelly\nHow high thank you for taking my call I have a quick question a lot of combat per cent of question my comment is but that are and\nI have watched mcgary I'm On a ... and she has fallen and what I Am a strong woman that she and her ... pretty good model for her considering she wants to be a hostage negotiator for the FBI um my question is who do you think\nBe a good person to take her place\nWhy I have a I have an idea of names or I'm not gonna I'm not going to give him out um but if you want somebody that's got that same kind of grasp of the issues I mean Nikki Haley was ... you know political experience was governor of South Carolina born state every state's important but it plays a key role but she she was a quick study on the ... international affairs\nAnd she was with effective advocate so I think that's what you what that's the kind of be\nYou're looking for in a\nUN ambassador and uh as as Harry and I were just talking about you got to be a very effective advocate barrier that may not be the world sees you know look there's a lot of behind the scenes you really see a glimpse of the general assembly but the world sees that too\nYeah that's right I mean you you it's the when the U.S ambassador to the United nations space on the other half of the United states it's broadcast around the world so the tone is very important that the the word used because of how they get translated uh but the the the ability or you have to be a great\nOrator you really do I mean you have to be and that's why come together so it was a governor someone who can talk for necessary\nStand up to bullies at at the un but also a or B reconcile and uh be diplomatic at the same time and I think that's something that Nikki Haley had a unique ability and why she has been so popular in that role of standing tough without a seeming gratuitously tough yeah at the United\nNation relations yeah I mean we're hopeful the here and we may be able to hear from a bachelor daddy didn't own the Israeli ambassador to the United nations during the second half hour of the broadcast it will keep you posted on that are taking your calls the hundred and sixty four thirty went down I Want to ask a quick question a band I got a throes of Mary ... from eight people are asking already on Facebook\nWants the confirmation because they've just been through the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process what this confirmation gonna look like well\nObviously depend on who it is Jay but look I think you need expected to be contentious I think you're going to have to appoint somebody that is is qualified ready for the job so that they can get through look I I think this is one of the reasons jade that you're not going to see somebody who is already in a spot that require confirmation because then all of a sudden you have two people that you've got to get through the confirmation process\nI think those are probably going to be somebody that's not in a confirmed spot already in jail for debt\nThat there's two qualities that Nikki Haley had the next candidate will have its gotta be somebody that's tough as nails 'cause they've got to go into this venue and be prepared for people to walk out when their advantage or gender\nOr but then they're going to also have to have that diplomatic characteristic that Jordan talking about Nikki Haley leaves it very well liked inside the United nations yesterday and that's tough to do when you're advancing engineers aggressive if she has she's\nBeen very effective uh Elena base looks at Nikki Haley's resolving strength changed the position of UN ambassador we need something like that to fill that role I think I think it was definitely right here I think that's\nPrecisely correct so we need someone like Nikki Haley someone who is a clear coherent advocate of tough American policies someone who demands respect on the world stage\nAnd someone that advances our interest how hard do you think the confirmation fight for this one could be [noise] depends on the person but it's very hard I could be very hard difficult and this will like this will be emitted [noise] yeah so I think so now to tournaments or that's what happened another impact and then they let me see if could could\nYou control the U.S Senate though it'd be a tough confirmation but not as tough\nAs a Supreme Court which is what we're taking your calls the one eight hundred ... are pretty much and that's because we are here for another thirty minutes if you're not getting out of the broadcast [noise] just go ratio Jay down over audio and video streaming at their same on Facebook and parents go open our social media platforms\nAnother way for you to hear the broadcast we encourage you to do that\nAs well at a a seal jaded over Facebooking periscope I mean if you want to talk to us eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten back with\nIt's a critical time for a nation where I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country the work of the American Center for launches has never been more and more and more\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family member and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and we'll just for\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now we see el ... daughter\nBut she says for much that's all\nWell she has done an unbelievable amount I think that you know she has her reasons or for going but but she is set the bar as you get a perfect point it was set the bar high but ready for someone to grab on to that man so\nAnd and run with it continue to run with it but she did I think since she fundamentally change the U.S position at the un through her role as a bastion of course that comes through the Trump Administration instruction but she did it\nSuccessfully at a very difficult time in our foreign policy I mean Harry we are living at a time where there are there are\nThe issue in Syria should deal with whether it's tried to uh uh come to some agreements with North Korea or with the Chinese and and the currency issues to trade ... all of that comes into play at the un\nJordan you're absolutely correct Nikki Haley's performance will indeed be a tough act to follow under Nikki Haley and President Trump's leadership\nDecisions made by foreign governments and international agencies to oppose American interests are\nHave been met with consequences that's important\nIn other words U.S policy demands respect\nOn the world stage under the prior administration U.S policy a demanded disrespect on the world stage\nOff didn't we offered a program of an open door all the foreign governments had to do was to push against an open door we would continue to fund them they would continue to post American interest\nOr that approach has ended a and I think that's a fortunate for American policy going forward\nIf you want to talk to us on the air one eight hundred sixty eight four thirty one citizen number you call that's one eight hundred six eight for three one one zero what is issue is most important to you\nFor the next US ambassador what issue do you think there'll be facing\nUh for the next US ambassador or who represents us at at a as such important position listened to Nikki Haley you get to see this this goes into what I've been saying about the the way that the u._s. should be treated we talked about how the u._s. should be treated by countries but she was critical view itself\nAnd how it treated the U. S. is one of its main a key funders of the United nations take a listen\nWhen we make generous contributions to the land\nWe also have a legitimate expectations that are good well his recognize cameras that when a nation and singled out for anti can this organization that nation disrespect what's more\nNation is asked to pay for the privilege of being disrespected in the case of the United states we're asked to pay more than anyone else for that and give the president\nI mean that right there again is so important that\nIt is not going to be than uh the u._s. that just accept un condemnation either so we talked about how she took a stand against these countries that would vote against our interests but then she took it a step further and and brought it brought against the entire us infrastructure [noise]\nWell I think the rest of the world and the United nations uh Jordan has just taken it for granted that the United states would always be the piggy bank for their accounts their programs they're foreign aid\nAnd you look at just a couple of examples the human rights council and then on rather United ... nations relief works agency\nOr Jordan neither one of them were advancing either the agenda of the United states or quite frankly the stated agenda of those two programs as to what President Trump and investor Haley had to have said is look\nYou can vote how you want but there will be ramifications you don't have an inherent write to us taxpayer dollars so you can make a choice you can either work with us you can either advance our shared interests and then we will stand with you or you can walk the other way but if you walk the other way Jordan including with these programs\nDon't expect us to be the piggy bank for those programs it's about time I Would say it's decades overdue Jordan\nYou know the Israeli ambassador to the United nations day to know just going to be joining us in the next segment broadcast take a listen to what he said about how a Nikki Haley changed or the U.S position at the un\nPerson you don't get that then you estimate of after they're standing on the U.S in a different place\nPeople respect the U.S today in the UN because it was a lot of fried stand firmly even when he ran that she was in the may know with the human and we do the votes she was the other way and I think today you got that we've spent so many countries in the Security Council in the family\nAnd that important because if you want to be able to respect you at the un and international community and today that means more respect so that by the end of the United states so that when a station anything America strong here today\nIn the best way to know will be joining us in the next segment of the broadcast sees the Israeli ambassador to the un a so he knows that Nikki Haley very well and the ... and you just heard the phrase he had a for her and and the change their let's go to gyms called Washington state\nOn line for Jim welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nGuys thanks how are you doing I'm Frank Gulf states Florida Georgia Alabama\nI'm you know what the church thing and he was the thing I Will absolutely completely miss the graceful demeanor and presence of Nikki Haley dealing with the extremely difficult issues in the UN and one of those you talked about the hard or the difficulty of being a UN ambassador\nIn your opinion [noise] um what if any shovel a person like John cherry a and his statements or his activities meeting with Iranians or any other um what what kind of wait is that longevity Haley Warren ...\nWell see fit Nikki Haley came in and had to make it very clear and she did that this was not business as usual with the United states anymore that was her job and I think that's why she could leave all that high note uh this this\nAnd it states anymore that was her job and I think that's why she could leave all that high note uh this this uh at the end of the year\nHer job was to reverse the years of the John Kerry types or who by the way he's been following decades of U.S foreign policy practice of trying to appease everyone and not be critical about their votes and not actually care about them condemning us and keep giving millions of dollars\nHer job was to reverse that and make it clear to the world that we were we were telling the truth will be said that it wasn't just words was backed up by actions so similar to President Trump who helped doesn't just talked about terrorists would influence them uh uh uh and uh I'd say she's at things like that\nAt the same goes for the un funny so it was her job to fundamentally transform the U. S. physician at the un and how to do the body you went and saw the U.S and the individual countries themselves\nAll right we're taking your calls during the last segment the broadcast at one of the hundred and sixty four three one ones here we have to be joined by ambassador Danny de known to US ambassador\nU.S Israeli ambassador to the United nations so we hope to be joined by with him shortly alright\nWe're going to take more calls our thoughts and prayers watching that storm big one in the panhandle of Florida category for winds up to a hundred and Seventy miles in our guts a state at one fifty we'll take your calls at one eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero that's eight hundred and sixty four thirty one ten and again pray for those folks down there that especially the emergency responders\nIs a lot to go with a lot of potential damage down there that is going to be to be very significant I mean I I Can't imagine it won't be a little just looking at the size of the storm we pray for the best so one eight hundred and sixty four three one one zero getting the last segment broadcast we'll take your calls also you can get in and on Facebook and prayers go we'll be back with more\nIt's a historic move now the United states is December seem Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nOf the state of Israel and is very right to exist as a lynchpin issue not only in the middle east but represents a critical issue to the world at large Israel is facing unprecedented challenges enemies about\nISIS among below in Iran\nAll pledge white Israel from the very severe in his new book New York times best selling author Jay Sekulow represents a powerful political and historical rationale for the existence of Israel as a sovereign nation in Jerusalem middle school and historical case for the Jewish capital presents clear your review double evidence to\nRemove any doubt about Israel's right to exist and the book do spells legal ... reported by Israel's in and\nGet your copy today in Jerusalem a middle school and historical case for the Jewish capital\nAvailable now an Amazon\nIt is been or mission for nearly Thirty years\nAt the American Center for law and justice were dedicated to protecting your religious and constitutional freedom because of the many ACL Jay members who stand with us we've seen great success over the years as we engage in legal legislative cultural issues that matter most to you and your family\nA C.
