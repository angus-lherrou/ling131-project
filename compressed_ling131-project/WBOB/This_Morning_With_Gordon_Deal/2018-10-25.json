J. daughter\n[noise]\n\nWe are less than two weeks out from the mid term elections [noise]\nWe have a caravan of fourteen thousand uh it's estimated somewhere between seven and fourteen thousands of possible do people are joining\nThis care of it coming out of Central America all the time it ... out of Honduras heading towards the U.S border or the U.S are asking towards alongside Mexican authorities to work together to prevent a crisis at the U.S border up again you could see politically how this is also very politically charged\nBecause we're leading into a midterm election where immigration is always a top issue especially in states that are dealing with this by California Arizona and other border states in the country I text us\nAs well which is one of the ports of entry it's actually the closest ports of port of entry\nOr that these migrants could choose to try it inter from if they're not interdict it up before that we've seen something similar like this or this year back in April it was much smaller the ... the total number to its highest point was about Fifteen hundred people\nIt ended up big only about four or five hundred people who reached the border out\nOf that uh it was down to about Ninety percent that made their first initial asylum claims or the rest were arrested for illegally injury or the United states so that is the news or there will continue to talk about this caravan issue I think it will dominate up till the ... elections obviously a lot of issues will\nBut with your lasted two weeks away from the decision point on who controls Congress\nRepublicans or Democrats were you talking about the house and the set it all of these issues are covered the play even what's happening I unfortunately what's happening right now with these suspicious packages that comes into play\nI don't want to make a political but the people targeted our political or their news outlets so again I Want to ... the strongest Herb's\nEighty one who who believes that this is the way to send messages or to those you disagree with a it is wrong it is illegal to this and they should be prosecuted put away\nTo the fullest extent of the law is not how their kids work is that our political system works here's the state but from the White House\nWe can ... the attempted violet attacks recently made against President Obama\nPresident Clinton Secretary Clinton at other public figures these terrorize he acts are despicable it eighty would response but we will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law\nThe United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating it will take all appropriate actions to protect ... threatened\nBy these cowards I again we will continue to update you\nIf there's more news on the suspicious packages are I think what are the biggest parts of this is the entire time water sitter in New York is a as we report out still evacuated which is a big deal I mean that's a big deal it's just a type ordered CNN\nIt's a hotel it's a it's a shopping center at say it's got lots of different offices restaurants uh it's just a hub Columbus Circle\nUh illegal immigrants or those attempting to become a illegal immigrants into the U.S a ... out of ... I Want to take your phone calls this a one eight hundred sixty four thirty what we've got a great team today on the show to answer your questions about Michael's called from California on line three\nMichael welcome to Jay Sekulow live\n... thank you for taking my call takes Michael I Believe that you've made it clear some things can get very ugly if they care of and gets all the way to the border so\nMy question is can way with the cooperation of Mexico get more involved along the path to turn this thing back before it ever gets here\nHere's the good news Michael is it President Trump believes that we can take a list I think it's so important that we are hearing this from President Trump\nDid he will work with with sometimes it's tough like it was the president of Mexico where the president the United states but on this issue or they want to work together this is not good for Mexico this for two thousand people\nFor the United states take a listen to the president\n... ... is working with us there is a movement toward our country is so in a while before they get here and his group that has around this will be involved and others will have a\nWe cannot pay fulfillment illegal\nNow and the I Want to go to your boss she did the first time in Mexico try to ... interdict this group they were overrun\nOr they were not prepared for the amount of people so it appeared that there was an attempt a ... by a Mexican authorities to prevent this group for moving forward and in fact it's such a large group that they were overrun ... and not able to prevent it\nNow their path I remember\nThe images of Jordan obscene that ... that were terrifying images of\nOf a thousands and thousands of people clawing at the fences and pulling them down and the gates\nBeing ripped ... out of their hinges and the and the chain link fences coming down and the Mexican authorities nowhere to be seen and unable to interdict and to stop this\nA tidal wave of humanity that was just a inexorably moving in an orderly direction toward the United states and that was a very frightening spectacle to me I looked at a gas in my mouth fell open as I'm looking at this and I'm saying\nThis is internally within the Mexican nation and they ... they reached the border or wherever the crossing was a that they uh had gated in fenced off and here the Mexican authorities could do absolutely nothing\nA dead to prevent this ... crossing from taking place\n[noise] let me go to Steve in Florida on line six I think Steve got a good point it relates back to the last time this happened in the April Steve welcome to Jay Sekulow alive you're on the air\nToday a good Steve our military has the ability to put him were just showing you need it why don't we have the ability to do the same thing with walls with these people will be it'll work out the miles away it should be able to set up by\nI Believe we actually did that when it was a smaller group so back in April there were wall set up a to make sure that individuals uh that was a much smaller number again that we're talking about\nUh about Fifteen hundred total ... ended up being about five hundred that made it to the wall\nBut there was a wallet place I I don't know if it was a temporary structure put there by the military or certainly one that was reinforced hairy so yes you could harried certainly have the time with a thousand miles out or twenty two hundred miles out depending on which border crossing a this group decides to go to or if they split up to go to different\nA border crossings there there are certainly times to reinforce specific areas of the border\nI think you're absolutely right Jordan ha it's important also to note that the border between the United states and Mexico is very very long yeah and so the U.S military out to the extent that they are able to put up temporary structures to impede\nA border crossing a bay will perhaps have to wait about in the sense to find\nOut what direction of the caravan is going to take a but there will still than be time to put up some Tipperary structures to impede the caravan from crossing into the United states but I also think ah we should focus um most of our efforts at the moment\nOn diplomatic ah ... efforts with respect to Mexico um I think secretary of state pump pale according to CNN News just said that the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nYou know and so that is why I think again very important folks to ... this is a this is the executive branch issue right now\nCongress could certainly pass federal laws prevent this in the future but right now the executive has to deal with what they're dealing with we come back we'll take more your phone call second half hour one eight hundred sixty four thirty one ten ... up to you on the suspicious device says well we condemn whoever\nOr whomever is behind this for whatever reason they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law will be back on Jay Sekulow law\nIt's a critical time for our nation I Am for the world\nWith so many challenges facing our country in the work of the American Center for launch of has never been more important to them right now\nAt the ... were engaging the issues that matter most to you and your family\nMember and make a difference as we were to protect your constitutional and religious freedom\nYou can become a member of the AC OJ on law sign up right now the the L ...\nA indicting them prosecuting them and convicting them and and then uh the judges imposing the appropriate sanctions that's a difficult task\nThat real task is interdiction and intervention before approach to the United states as a practical matter who\nAre going to talk about that just a moment Harry for those who are behind these explosive devices or whether it's one individual it's certainly they all purely the law enforcement has told us that\nA serious charges for them is I mean the most serious these are terrorist type charges so what you attempt to utilize weapons of mass destruction the individuals that they are targeting a increases that as well the fact that it's\nMajor buildings a a former presidents of the United states again all of that comes into play about that these people should be I don't care what political persuasion they are there should always be condemned and prosecuted America has no place in our country\nYou were absolutely right so these individuals should face charges for terror related offenses potentially for attempted murder and to the extent that the devices were sent through the u._s. mail should also face charges are connected to that\nAnd that ah upon conviction of all of those charges that should lead two sentences which ... should exceed probably twenty to Thirty years in prison 'em and fortunately uh up to this point none of these devices have exploded\nBut nonetheless uh these individuals should face a terror related charges at a minimum\nWe have a lot of course his company at about how the care of it started what goes on here I Greg is calling from California understandably get a lot of calls from California Texas places where this could certainly come to a point hopefully it won't get their regret welcome to Jay Sekulow live you're on the air\nHey right aren't they are much for our own worst I was wondering who ... who has talked on this group of people and and that that's a lot of people who had told him he let us because several\nSeveral who has ... and ... and hold it we'll be hearing the care of that\nWell there is a ... a former leftist lawmaker that's been identified I don't know how much power he has a but he I was terribly limited\nHis name as ... as a former ... Baker the leftist Libra party\nHas admitted to play a role in facilitating a one of the care of as it left this month but he said that was a much smaller care of and so\nThere's obviously a lot of leftist leaders like him in Central America focusing on this there's also a group claiming that was totally organized by ... below sea fraud terrorists do we know a lot about that who the who is funding that group will\n[noise]\nTo their Adam ... space organization so I mean again they're finding out who's actually behind it just like with any other non profits probably very difficult though it does appear these caravans than\nOur our sit up for political purposes I think the people are being used unfortunately I feel horrible for most of these people not the criminals there that the people that are that are certainly the bad actors\nBut I feel horrible for most of the people that kids involved ah the the the women involved who are being used by these political forces and these groups like ... from terrorists\nYeah during the real people with real needs who are being used for a political purpose in many many cases and look it all comes back to the underlying policy point that we've been talking about\nYou got a you know motives for the origins of this caravan that are almost\nAlmost for sure Jordan they were manufactured they were made out now it's all also almost certain that you had\nPeople with legitimate concerns that then join that Caribbean so when they when they got to the border you would have\nA mix of motives that then you would have to sort through Jordan under our current scheme down at the border of that as an impossible task to accomplish again it comes back to the policy point\nOf having a physical barrier proper ports of entry and improper laws for turning back who people who are not a legitimately entering look if there's a legitimate asylum claim there can be a process in place for that but it's a person claiming asylum\nHas passed through a country where they could have sought refuge and declined to do so then the customs and border patrol Jordan has to be able to turn that person around and Congress does not have the proper laws in place\nFor the administration to do that so yes I agree with you the origins of this we're almost almost certainly political they were almost certainly manufactured but then you have a mix of organic need mixed into it and you have to have the public policy in place should people reach the border to separate that next and right now Jordan I'm just not so sure we have that in place\nA folks if you want to talk to us on the one eight hundred sixty four thirty one tennis they had brought up and I you know the LA which focused on the international law and one of those uh that that I focused on was this law immigration and refugee status\nAnd it's pretty clear throughout the world the first place you hit that as a safe place for you or is the place you're supposed to declare refugee status so for these individuals\nThey at least pass through most of them Guatemala a they pass through what country before even getting to Mexico so let's say they say okay we're not I'm not safe in Guatemala\nArgue that safe in Mexico the you've got to make a case that you're not um and of course ... ... the the situation in Mexico could be much better than the situation for you it Honduras so that you have\nThe obligation to declare a that that that is where you will declare your refugee status but it does not appear that those laws that are all the books are being strongly and forced off\nBy the United states that something Congress could tighten but it's also something the administration could do a through customs and border patrol as well as you know with these caravans you're passing through multiple countries\nWhy did you declare refugee status earlier Joseph has a question about that called in from Georgia on line to Joseph welcome to Jay Sekulow live\nOr to have and came on I was just wondering I'm In the dirt Air National guard down here I Know it's not an or no way to put up a temporary structure I was wondering if we do and the military going just drop right with or get some coordination with Mexico and set up something ... water where\nWe could provide food shelter clothing that fat and the other so that people that do have like that and we need need this kind of things that the water or medical supplies can get taken care of and pulled out of that ... that kind of broken up as well\nCan get taken care of and pulled out of that ... that kind of broken up\nWell it depends on how far the care of it gets I think a Joseph I'll go to\nHarry first go round I think this is for everybody to answer very briefly if the care of it gets that close the U.S border yes there will likely be some kind of supplies set up at the U.S wants to start process a process see uh some of the people about the idea is that it will not get\nA be allowed to work you actually get to that point\nI think you're absolutely right so our objective should be to stem the flow of the caravan while they're still in Mexico or in Central America that's number one and then number two we should have\nSteps in mine or should they moved further and closer to the American border as wide eyed\nType right now to get Eddie ... comments on let me just say this there's also thousands of humanitarian groups the U.S and Mexico could work with to provide the humanitarian need so that it does it become a direct country it's ...\nLike if I reach the U.S border they're going to take care of me that becomes a citizen so I think that's best for the nonprofit world\nWho should rush to these kind of a situation regardless of the politics of player the immigration politics to play and if people need help those who are in need and we could\nThat these countries can facilitate that as well and\nJay Sekulow live [noise]\nIt's a historic move now the United states has moved
