remarkable capacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon it greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse\nThis really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nNow Chris I Know that we turn to already by the green tea in the current human your new green she she are liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk their ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines and the science behind was very ... I Know some red wine and French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds say I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like\nGreen tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body that happen during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin\nInsensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and\nYou know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French\nParadox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be key in that\nAnd additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that we're just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Chris let's laser in on how this wonderful formula you created to judge Judy ...\nI Know that purity it's been a business now for\nWhat is it over Twenty years they're going to stop reading the better Business Bureau and people can get complimentary bottle of this green T.
