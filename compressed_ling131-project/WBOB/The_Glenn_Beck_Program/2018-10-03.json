how can you see the ad in the oil that we got as well that's right you did buy that ...\nAnd I've been using the orange one here in the last couple of days than it had definitely definitely like it just the smell of it because it's such a small itself vibe or you know vibrant it just didn't see that Herman\nYes all that's supposed to be good and healthy for you and um I definitely want to get into that I Want to that's the only thing I have not added\nUm into my bedroom\nLet's see designed to sell and\nUm what's this other show it was a curb appeal was my favorite yeah it was corporate peel and curb appeal to block mhm um those were my absolute I used to tell my clients to watch it that we're going to listen to her house because\nFor a thousand dollars he would spruce up the neighbor's house you know a little bit when I have to touch a paint here some landscaping\nI'm so\nHere's my interview with John getting\nJohn getting welcome to Jacksonville\nThanks to how to like our town I Love it I've been here once before and I'm happy to come back if such a warm welcoming town and it's also very different for Florida I think it is this isn't a Miami [noise] no\nWarm welcoming community in a way\nThat you spend a lot of time in Georgia and so it's kind of\nSimilar here in Jacksonville yes put that southern touch and um\nI Hope you've been able to get out and about in at ... at least to be a\nReally nice neighborhood beautiful architecture myself some of the neighborhoods that are low lying and were hit by the storm last year yet um they bounce back beautifully I think I Know that some businesses took months to be able to bounce out of it but\nHave you back to our San Marco or riverside area a little bit we're close to the river side here and I walk but I haven't really fully explore\nThe fetus Everytime I'm In those areas I think the curb appeal when you're on a few TV ad or pork curb appeal to block which was those were both my favorite shows I've got to admit I use them as a training tape for my clients when I was going to lift the property I Would tell him to watch those because it doesn't take a whole lot of money\nUp and touched the outside of your home to get top dollar\nIt really doesn't we would spend twenty thousand for the big project but only a thousand for the small project\nAnd a thousand dollars especially for someone trying to sell the house is not a huge investment now and the return on investment is so huge especially if you do with smart and focus on the few details that everyone's going to notice like the walkway the front door lighting how some of the things that we all know\nWe've been noticed by buyers by people who are projecting their life into that house\nAnd then it ends up you know resulting in a higher so\nDo you have a particular color perhaps they feel that sells for most for homes or maybe up front door I don't like the typical black and red for the front door like using all different types of colors and\nToday it seems like even Lowe's and Home Depot and all those different stores have now a section\nFor front door pays yeah yeah um I don't have a one specific color but I'm with you I Try to push out of the typical colors elections especially because\nHaving done so many homes I Would grow bored if I were only doing the same things over and over again so in a way these projects have been laboratories for me I found the yellow doors don't sell well [noise]\nUm the yellow houses too so that's interesting so really yeah it's\nInteresting that advancing I'm a red doors there's right and there's ... you know there's a fire engine red which is one thing\nIs is beautiful shades of rather do more of a few shows and the purple that I think are beautiful for funds or especially on a more classical architectural style I Love your show that's like my favorite color related back in ... one thing I was so homeowners with regard to the front doors is if you're gonna painted have fun with it [noise] push a little outside of comfort zone [noise]\nDo a jewel tone company with some juicy and bright\nAnd the result is going to be you're going to love it and if you don't guess what it's another we can paint project is not a big deal right it's fun it gets you engaged and he tried something that we've [noise] yes\nYou're like I said my favorite HGTV show but the good news is your back\nAnd you are on TLC with\nTrading spaces so tell us about you being on trading spaces sure\nWas a [noise] a great honor to be included in the new line up are generally when I go way back and I think she really helped me get onto the show but um what I liked about being on the sort of ...\nIs I get to see how the same designers that we've known from way back in the day\nFrankly developed you know because back then they were on television that with their main gig and now they've spent ten years in the marketplace holding their craft\nAnd TV that with their main gig and now they've spent ten years in the marketplace honing their crap\nBut working with budget that they haven't worked with a New Years so it's kind of fun\nTo see [noise] it's also fun because with two thousand dollars you're really creating art you're pushing creativity to a new level yes it's an interior space yeah people will have to actually get some utility out of it but you're trying to create a fun moment for a TV [noise]\nA fund reveal and use two thousand dollars in a creative way typically\nInvolves doing some art [noise] um I think of it as an art show rather than interior design show [noise]\nI Love art and I don't mind spending money on art and uh what are some tips that you can get our listeners about perhaps you know purchasing some are just to make their house look more appealing sure\nThis is such an important thing and you pick up any shelter magazine you'll notice every beautiful photograph\nThat piece of art in that photograph barn on every single photograph\nSo when you really think about design holistically you have to include those walls spaces and yes a lot of people put photographs\nAnd posters but as they are trying to buy art I say I'm I have five let's see if I can remember them five rules Osama [noise] one you need to have an intent was the intention of the art needs to be clear even to you\nIs it to fill up a wall space cause it to bring in color is a set of palate whatever it is you've got your own intent and as soon as you do that's great [noise]\nUm the second thing is\nI think a lot of people say as soon as you can be arcs speak to you that already excuse you need ... to actually buy that people are\nSo I feel like as a rule of thumb if you love it you've already started on the right for\nMe to budget um this is I think what separates people who are kind of really looking around at art to people who are there within intensify as soon as you know your budget you become an art buyers and that I think the kind of advantage that um allows you to immediately make a purchase as long as if it's your budget\nWithout having to go home and think about it and lose that piece of art [noise]\nI don't remember my other two points frankly but those three are good\nThat's a lot of pointers right there\nAnd I think what people need to realize is something that touches you\nOn the wall and it doesn't have to be expensive and the same with decorating your home is bring your personality into it and like you said spending a couple of thousand dollars or even a thousand dollars to make a big difference\nA short now or the ex terrier curb appeal a thousand dollars great march\n... started lower you know like especially for beginning part [noise]\nIf you set a loner budget that means that that low bar or something you'll be able to pass when you finally run into something that fits within that budget\nTwo hundred dollars a year for example\nTo always praising another year because this should be a lifelong experience you know our walls are our\nMuseums we get to show the development of our lives and our careers and our families and our culture through what we show on our wall saw an article\nFor one thing I Know is it you've\nGot just a wide range of experience you travel a lot you're a graduate from Gail and from um Harvard\nWhich is very impressive\nThen you happier degrees an architect\nOne is and all the things that you do you know HDTV TLC travel are\nWhat is the one thing that you really have a lot of passionate about it takes you to that quiet\nRelaxing place that you enjoy the most\nI think in playing the piano [noise]\nUm I learned to play the piano the kid and then I\nHad a break and then I got back to it when I was thirty I caught a piano for my birthday party for my birthday on my third it\nAnd it's been a beautiful journey of reconnecting with this incredible instrument for me and when I recently moved from New York to San Francisco I Move my piano with me and I can't imagine going anywhere without it\nUm I play every day and it's definitely that quiet place that you mentioned before\nI can lose myself and it's such a joy to be able to play an instrument\nWell John getting so happy that you took some time out to spend with W. B. O. B. and a\nCourse we want all our listeners to tune into trading spaces on TLC\nYou have a great great cast so I'm looking forward to lots of the yeah you got to be fun and you mentioned\nNext week you

fun about eleven hundred acres we expect this almost to be self contained village between the lagoon between the or the beach club mental up its facilities as well as the shopping retail and commercial out front um they'll be no reason to leave other than going to work if you have to\nTry to work from home I wouldn't get much done though I like that are only would not get much done so\nUm [noise] the homes how many homes you had actually have on the lagoon itself\nUm there'll be a total of about thirty six homes surrounding go directly facing on the lagoon there all the attached homes that we're building a as a ... as from America and I heard that some of 'em have elevators on yes three of our for models have the\nOption for an elevator um they do comes to stories to them to have the option or third story the elevators can be two or three stories whatever you wish\nAnd I think that's great for you know you got people that some of them needed men are one thing I notice because as I've gotten older um you know looking for a patio home people just aren't building patio homes or the one level home they'll have\nYou know one to pick from and it's usually not the one you really want\nAnd so um this is nice because it gives people the option of still enjoying um the ability of a two story and happy and they may seem views and I'm ... and having the elevator attach great\nOr ... or ... or masters are on the second floor and the reason for that is that all of a lot cheaper face lakes or face for the gun and they have very large overlooked so you could enjoy the outdoor living and have the view as well which would not have on a first for\n[noise] and you guys are going to have you mentioned earlier that community itself in the shopping center um I saw that particular
