develop mailing lists and so if they if you have something to throw other than that a soft drink [laughter]\nDon't throw any I sent me please okay\nWe are at it it it is it is indeed election season we are trying to to to do twenty things at the same time so sorry about that but where we're glad to to have this hour with everybody um we've got a lot of things that we wanted to talk about but I I also wanted to let you know that obviously\nYou can call in with any questions or comments or that you have nine zero for to to to talk that's nine zero for eight to five five and a a give us a call 'em\nFirst thing we are going to have a special gas at a that two Fifteen we've got um a Mr to mice and men as calling in uh he's putting on a an event he does a really really really good job at doing candidate forums didn't does that tack Huler job during the um the primaries\nAnd uh um it it he's he's got another one lined up that we are going to be talking about the coming up next week so he's going to be joining us on the radio and just a few minutes after the next after the break\nBut uh in the meantime ... um first thing I Want to let people know about is the huge event that we have going on\nHere in Jacksonville October Eighteenth and his Thursday October Eighteenth and we're going to be at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial arena in the evening for a huge banquet\nThese special guest coming in is judge Janine and judge Janine if you have not I\nI I Would assume most of the people listening in have have seen judge Janine on Fox News she's got her Saturday evening I'm a show\nShe also has been feeling it a lot for I'm Sean Hannity which is actually why we have her on Thursday October Eighteenth\nOriginally we were we were going to set things up for friday and then she suddenly had to fill in for sun that night so we had got or Thursday October Eighteenth and it's going to be a really great evening I'm that up but there there are receptions there's a full banquet um she's going to be speaker\nUh it along with I might add some of the the big state like\n[noise] ah it along with I might add some of the at the big statewide candidates that will be in town as well when we know for sure that Ron dissent is running for governor we'll be here that night and we'll be speaking on stage with judge Janine so that'll be great uh and\nThey got good chemistry 'cause they've worked together before actually so that that's going to be it's going to be a good show\nCouldn't ... couldn't help but reflect on or something you said just a little while ago about to someone you knew being a very Curt bought a trigger point um and then you brought a judge Janine yeah and and I thought ... these two characters that you were talking about couldn't even hold again [laughter]\nThat's true that is true she's she's a spit fire I Love I Love it absolutely love it and I think most people do so if you want to\nThe winning August ... it paid off and only at the end\nYou did a great job and I mean you had you had all the major um races on the ballot or and and most of the candidates for each race did show up and I I Believe that you know I didn't ... that in and of itself is quite a seat\nBut then to get three hundred voters in there who who who are going to listen to what people have to say so they can make up their minds and in in in ... in in foreign ballad that's incredible that's huge\n[laughter] you know that's really the the truly are focused on a tour of the focus has been um to just create awareness and and get you know folks who want to be involved a and even those who maybe have not been involved in the past\nUh inform so that they can make an informed decision when they're going to the ballot I think I think there's been a little bit of a obviously we have some polar candidates right now that we're on one extreme or the other\nBut I I think that uh we need to get the word out as to what the values are of these specific candidates and you know who who I'm referring to 'em so that the the folks who are going to the ballot are informant understand the values of\nThe people that they're voting for and and uh I think if people come to know candidates individually as opposed to the rhetoric that goes on about party a I think that that's a good opportunity to get folks to vote and be energized to vote and to vote appropriately\nI think you're absolutely right and and you have\nA contact list and you have a network of people your own you know you you own your own law firm in and you have\nYou have your OWN Network of of attorneys but but you know just people in general uh that that you've interacted with 'em and and you were able to really pull a lot of people who would not have necessarily ever come to something that was put on by the Republican Party or by the Democrat Party you are able to just draw\nPeople in who really wanted to find out what was going on and be educated\nAnd it was amazing you did such a great job and I don't I I think that's exactly what's going to happen on October night as well\nThat's what we're projecting nothing could cover or to rent is going to prove to be even a greater success on the one that we had in July I think it's you know July was one that was you know it proved to be a number one that people want to be a part of it that they want to hear a front of the candidates they want to be involved\nAnd it was really the the kind of a stepping stone to really send us to the next level with the next event so we we work hard on that we got a little bit of coverage on it but it wasn't a knock obviously to to fill the room and this time around we're really getting a lot of exposure and I and I really think it's going to be a full house which is great\nBecause I think you know again it's kind of goes to being able to to create the understanding of who these folks are the folks we have the candidates\nAnd and for the constituents to understand these folks and meet them um you know and and and and be informed and that's really you know so I think again and ... and and really with all the things that go on and and the uh in the arena now with the elections\nIt's ah it's creating an environment for people to become more energized to go out and vote and I think that's that's helpful for us as far as putting these reserves together\nAbsolutely absolutely totally agree with you totally agree so okay so October ninth is a what what day of the week is it's a Tuesday to do and it's coming up Tuesday October nine\nSure is coming\nIt's amazing how just sneak up on ya [laughter]\nAnd and so a ... where is it and when and how do people get there and what do they have to do\nOkay so it's actually being held at a Havana ... or ... boulevard that's a twenty five Seventy Atlantic boulevard it's right across from the stumps in Catholic school in church and bishop Kenny\nI'm sure you're familiar with that in the St Nicholas area hosted downtown and we're starting at five thirty to do the meet and greet and registration a Kennedy form of start properly at six and then after the war on a we're going to have a a a reception where folks to interact and mingle with the candidates\n[noise] oh that's nice that's nice of people not only get to hear the candidates go back and forth with each other but you're going to be able to to to that they're going to hang around so you can talk with them ask your own questions get to know them you know and and\nSo they're going to hang around you can talk with them ask your own questions get to know them you know and and that make a decision\nAnd also senator and being has been gracious enough to uh to sponsor and provide a the phones for a for hors d'oeuvres that we're going to have at the end of the events oh wow so special thanks to a central being for doing that for us\nHere in being a senator and being he's a great guy really really\nIs he really is it really and truly is an interesting thing about our foreign that we're going to have if I can real quick draw up a plug it who's going to be there Oh yes please have\nAll of the candidates that are running for for the house or in the jak raiders actual area is going to be district eleven twelve Fifteen and sixteen the ones that are in a contested race will all be they're both sides and uh and then we'll have\nThe only Senate seat that has um um ah basically it and a bean and and your boss or the or the Democrat or you know when she does a contested seat right now for for the Senate in our area right there'll be there there'll be there as well\nSo it's going to be and they're going to present and of course we have other candidates for the upcoming elections for the um\nFor the unitary government that will be president as well but that's for next year's election so they weren't present we'll have another event for them to call\nBut you know I think it's going to be trying to be a full house\nAbsolutely fantastic so so you've got to um uh if you've got the U.S house a representative coming in then you've got air and being in in his uh his his opponent belly by third and then in district eleven at\nScored bird versus is necessarily Rob ...\nCorrect not quite sure how to say that I ... yeah I Know quite Yarborough and Timothy Yost is a district twelve\nCorrect district Fifteen is Wyman dug in and Tracy Paulson yes and then district sixteen is Jason Fisher and can or can't ask\nSo that is sad that that's gonna that's gonna be a good good event they they let them let them talk and in a kind of you are you going to be asking questions or is it going to be more of a format ... are they going to be able to go back and forth with each other how's that going to work\nWell what we are going to do is we're going to ask questions so we'll have movies I'm an opportunity to do in a shorter introduction it's obviously it's going to be a total of eleven folk so [noise]\nUm because we have eleven uh we got to kind of keep it a little ... concise but we'll have an opportunity to make a quick introduction will ask them a couple of questions uh we're gonna have some pointed questions though they're not going to be these easy softball questions were asked to some real good questions that are going to be directly\nUh with what the issues are in in in our country really I mean obviously our community is a you know obviously affected by that but what are what are the important issues that are facing us right now going forward and I heard you\nEarlier or talking about what we're facing as far as these concepts of uh of communism and are in these types of issues and obviously it's kind of the uh the one thing that we want to try to\nTalk about it and see you know warrior differences are on some of those I on those issues gun control issues and and and things like that are important\nAt all an excellent yeah I I yeah if when there are differences between candidates people must be aware so they can choose wisely so it's a little absolutely you know what I Am so happy that you were able to call in with us today so your advantage is coming up on Tuesday October nine tell us again it is have Anna jacks\nYes advantage actually ... boulevard in St Nicholas chocolate five thirty a candidate for and start a will begin at six o'clock\nAnd a seven o'clock reception to meet with an angry with the candidates and you can get more information we've set up a Web page on my Web site in case you wanted to folks want to get more information of the gambling analysts are it's a vote Jacksonville dot com that simple so if you go to the actual dot com you could read about who we are going to have\nWhere the location as you got the links to all the candidates there by other pictures and all the information that's relevant to the to the upcoming election\nThat's and that's that's fantastic al ... says the Jacksonville dot com everybody but they don't have to make reservations or anything to come they can just kind of is that right\nThat's right it's open to the public and I'm hoping that uh all your listeners than a ton of 'em [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah well I think that you folks if you want to come out and you will not only hear these candidates but if you've got a candidate that they you know that you are really rooting for ... and I think a lot of our listeners do get out in support your candidate\nOr that also makes a huge difference so um yeah I mean if you're listening to his radio show and you live in Jacksonville or the surrounding area or you work in Jacksonville in may cross the line to go home\nGet over next Tuesday to Havana jacks and uh and and sitting on his foreign because they do a great great job and there is a there is an open bar over there on\nThe side I wasn't about to say that it's not only is it a thorough ... we've got a great location to a ... everything comes together as a fantastic gaming\nExactly and and and he was while air and being a support providing these hors d'oeuvres people can order food while they're sitting there watching the foreign right from the restaurant\nOr is

[noise]\nSo that people have have this information in front of them\nWe need to to to get bodies we need people who are willing to go out and and and spend two hours or four hours or six hours knocking on doors and getting this material to the voters it is incredibly important I think everybody listening to ... to this radio show knows how important this election is I I\nYou know and it's all over the news it's all over Fox it's all over it's\nEverywhere it's everywhere you look at what's happening with Kavanaugh and and people are outraged here that outrage and do something help

say ... a gallon for gas\nRight that's a three dollars and change at the moment the best way to go ... there's a lot but they're on the er the website says donate their party and I'm sure they would
