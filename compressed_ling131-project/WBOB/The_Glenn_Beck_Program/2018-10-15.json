so that brings me back to Sebastian Gorka whose book\nImportant book jokes just came out is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies why did you wear it with no apologies\n[laughter] that's a ... of the last two years with the previous eight is where we had a president\nBy Obama actually stopped to his presidency where they global apology to\nWho said that everything from quote unquote global warming to terrorism as some of the fall to the United states so that will change the twelve o'clock Johnny the twenty of last year and we have a president in fact the good lord who is proud of who we are what we represent\nA is telling the world that we are back with the good guys and if you want to be friends you can be friends and if you threat laugh we will deal with you in the

message to the world that ... is not inevitable\nYes and and he is prepared to challenge thing is that nobody else would be prepared to do in the mainstream conservative movement I mean just just one moment from from Saturday last Saturday\nWhen he had a cat that Kavanaugh family in in the White House and what did he do he stood up in front of the world\nAnd the clad the innocence of this man\nThat's the moral fortitude of Donald Trump\nHe doesn't care whether you agree with him he knows what's right such as recognizing Jerusalem as the title capital the Jewish state moving the embassy think about the fact that is for twenty three years every American president promised that every six months this is the absurdity every six months\nThe incumbent president had to sign a waiver to say sorry guys not now I mean this is what the man can cut through\nWhen he stayed with Brett Kavanaugh I kept thinking how they're even Republicans who would not have\nThought my gosh yes I mean and the way he handled it was so ...\nHe was ... he was quiet and then when he saw all the way this man had fought for his reputation justly\nAnd the way that good Americans not just you know hard call Reagan all but just the average Americans were incensed\nWhat did he do he stood up and he he highlighted the gaping for flaws in full it's testimony at his rally and he forced the media to pay that ten second clip\nAgain and again and again I didn't think of it that way oh my gosh it was awful because they refuse to cover it and we want to thank God the faucet that's right that's exactly right\nThe list this president I'll tell you another thing that the capital and hearing revealed to me although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but a confirmation I should say more than anything else\nAnd this will really shocked a lot of people to load the man I think he has a good heart\nDonald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what drives the left and say and they will never believe it

asked a question last hours that I Would like you to Ruben a palm [noise]\nWhat could the left to do that would in fact be a tipping point for non left wing Americans to say oh they really are a danger to everything we cherish\nOr even if that's to overstated I Do believe they are a danger to everything I cherish fine but even not going that far just sing at what point will people say the left has gone too far that's what that's\nMaybe by the way I totally entertained the possibility that there is no point if if a man can win a biological mail can win the women's cycling contests this happened this weekend\nAnd people are at peace with that than I truly entertain the possibility there is nothing too far if ten years ago let alone forget twenty five years ago even ten people would be told that a biological male who said he's a female\nWould win a women's bicycling contest they would have said that's ridiculous that's not fair you cannot have a biological bail otherwise that's the end of Women's Sports\nIf every biological male who was an athlete who wants to I'm identifies as a female is allowed to play against females that's the end the female sports\nSo it shows you the left doesn't that I've always said there's still left doesn't care about black select doesn't care about females that cares about power it cares about chaos it wishes to disrupt the ... the order of civilization\nAs it stands it it's a force for chaos for anarchy\nThis is proof if they cared about women they would say it's not fair you can't have a biological males compete against biological females but they don't care\nAre beginning to understand not in the numbers that I Would like to see but nevertheless I Would I Believe that it's significant Kanye West is is sort of\nThat it's

it up 'cause this is a this is a big deal may find that this I Would like to bring to your attention\nAnd if I Can't right now I Will after the break of another prominent black who's just announced that she is a Republican alright I'll bring it to you later 'cause it's a it's a big deal but this is happening a lot now\n\nAnd I'd like you to see we've now put it up a dentist Prager dot com because I gave you the wrong information earlier the talk that I gave\nAt the largest conservative synagogue a west the Mississippi and in LA last week about Jews and the left I I don't normally put by talks up by I give a gift for about a hundred and fifty of lectures a year I I I mentioned almost none of them but this was a significant\nMy ... my embarrassment bite my embarrassment\nAs a committed you have to support the ... that so many Jews have for the left it's just an embarrassment I I don't know what else to say it's that they were synagogues that went into the Jewish morning ritual of sitting shiver after Donald Trump was elected\nIs is a disgrace to Judaism they disgraced a beautiful religion by taking a religious act and so politicizing it\nBut it's it's the narcissism of the left and obviously it's in the mainstream Protestantism it's if it's in the pope of the Catholic Church\nLeft his him as powerful everywhere and it's poisons everything but anyway you can ... you can watch my lecture it is up at Dennis Prager dot com and you click on it then you can you can see it\nMy point was\nThe left doesn't care about Jews the left doesn't care about women in the left doesn't care about blacks the left cares about power\nThe the the the the Jewish issue is obvious because there was no more significant issue to Jews who care about the Jewish survival than the survival of Israel and the Democratic party is now increasing\nAnd the left is the center of anti Israel activism on earth Islamists and not all Muslims but Islamists Islamists and leftists are the
