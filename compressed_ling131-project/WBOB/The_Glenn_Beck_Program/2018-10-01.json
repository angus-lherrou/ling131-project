I'm a person that comes in the ... I don't have a\nNo I understand your point I get your point\nSo ... I'm personally I don't\nKnow I ... I understand your point I understand your point and I think a lot of conservatives Republicans do say things that are that if they want to let\nThem be silly and we stick to what's right I Am I going to let them for example here's a couple of that too often ... it's ... it's acting especially when the ... my wife and I love her to death\nUm they happen every member you know the Republican senators or understand a word or you know there's there's always going in their heads and those comments like that I'm right now\nThat I Do agree I thank you for your call it's a gratuitous come in and I just want to move on because there's so much I didn't mention that over eight hundred dead in Indonesia quake and tsunami told me rise so we got to keep all of this in perspective we care very much about our country\nBut and I'm not undermining that in a sense but I did want to report that also the prosecutor questioned a Ford stretch their case for its case I guess not her own you know a five page memo\nUh I just wish I had done that sooner while it was going on is supposed to who read this mark what did you take your questions\n... she she had a terrible format I've never seen a prosecutor being able to ask a witness questions and for five minutes and then have some uh some defender of of the witness or\nA disruptive ... that's a false of our Republican the Judiciary Committee that acquiesce to them yeah and that was the experiment to try to have a female sex prosecutors done this for Thirty years\nAnd it turns out to experiment with something so important in the ... well on the other hand they they they you know the big argument at the time was you know you want a female asking questions well she's extremely well qualified\nOr she did she had a terrible form at the bottom line is read the reader lighter\nIt it's on the let's do that now I'm just going to do the\nPoints that are the ones in jail just hold on one Dr Ford is not offer a consistent account of when the

innocent become less specific\nStuck for Dr Ford has no memory of key details of the night and question\nDetails that could have helped corroborate her account\nFive Dr Ford's Kennedy ledge assault has not been corroborated by anyone she's identified as having attended including her lifelong friend six Dr Ford is not offering consistent account of the alleged assault seven Dr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events\nRelating to her allegations center testimony regarding recent events further raises questions about her memory\nAnd my question courage you should have done this and wrap it up Dr\nFord's number a description of the psychological impact of the event raise questions nine the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affect the doctor for its account and I think these are all great point why did she do it at a day or\nThe the first of all we all could front is that is that we're ... ... these are wonderful points but\nOur whole discussion is on this is on the the the the opponents turf there this is what we're discussing instead of cattle now we have to do it there but secondly you know the reality is that if this were done

impressive as I was with Lindsey Graham\nWho finally said well we were thinking right well let's go grave it's plain spoken it when he talks to communicate very well and passionately and that's consultant saying that and it was it was a great ship surprised I mean there's been a transformation Lindsey Graham course he ran against Trump\nAny a brags about the fact that he got up to one percent\nSo so so he's got he's got a good you know a streak of a self self reflection and humility a but he he was ... he really captured the essence of what most Americans believe and believing most Americans are with us yeah\nWell I don't agree with him and illegal immigration but I have a what he did the other day was fantastic but what do you think flake and others like Collins and Murkowski and all these flaky Republican\nWell they are perennially that way it would be one thing if on one particular issue they were squishy or they do they had a certain level of commitment and sincerity ... important to me but it's an issue after issue their country playing hard to get and constantly jeopardizing the very thin\nWorking Republican majority we have the Senate ... self serving because they yeah go ahead well\nExcept that they're going to be voting for Kavanaugh and I finally figured it out why not withstanding the fact that voice quit open independents moderates not reliable McConnell's a genius he had to count the votes\nAnd are these women are well I guess two of them are women it's like it's like a a certain certainly not and and what we've learned from the from the three maybe the holdouts is that their understanding one thing if it's a Senate Democrat majority they lose all their committee assignments\nThey lose Ninety percent of their ... they're not they're not they don't realize that when the other party takes it you lose staff\nThere and and it's significant and it's hard to lose relevant you don't even get invited to the New York times Christmas Party yeah you guys are too good I'm not taking Jack's calling San Antonio because it says get these two guys are on TALK show\nAll I gave me jacks numbers the producer yeah could be who knows\nHow the Democrats so overplay their hand oh gosh yeah look the party the Democratic party's been completely taken over by the ... class\nGosh yeah look the party the Democratic party's been completely taken over by the not clash\nAnd the more extreme it you know what when Maxine Waters who's been back venture entire life is kind of a mainstream Democrat you know they got serious problems and the irony is that with all of a sexual misconduct cases most of them are Democrats you got Keith Ellison who still running for attorney general is a co chaired a Democrat this is\nWhy you do when I have some conservative talk about the ... it's all a conspiracy and so I I uh against ... or ... and they said it a few victims there but when you look because the Democrats are largely in power with\nA public broadcasting in public radio and CBS and ABC when it's on their ... whether it's Charlie would look at the whole Johnny rose and you probably have Ninety five percent of the other people have lost their jobs or been demoted law are for urban kicked out\nAre liberal Democrats there because they were in power just like Sacramento here in California for those who would actually wish it could be the same in your state capital if you have a capital where the Democrats are in control than the sexual harassment going to be mainly Democrats\nNot only that we lost free hardworking Democrats for those very charges on one is in jail for another reason as well as in ... for the Democrats keep getting in trouble\nAnd you know let me say this is going to surprise a lot of people there are a well I Can't stand Al Franken the personally it is and it's politics there he probably shouldn't have left the Senate because he was groping some woman's by not not saying what he did was right or whatever but but if they want to have that standard fine because let's decapitated a whole bunch of Democrats there at that threshold\nThere so that gets to my point and everybody's part what happens to the presumption of innocence will this road they've gone down well not so I just\nThis whole process you if you've had true traditional liberals and civil libertarians over the years there including Democrats or where to go forward and said you know there's a reason why we have limitations this evening is even prosecutorial now in in Maryland there and it's from the high school and I was at a than a Senator Feinstein was it was a person of of the principal\nShe would have dismissed us things that I Can't do you find something happened in high school\nAnd and you know what what do we have now a days just\nEverything is considering the same level as rape or a you know and and but\nIt's you know you you have a a a workplace where somebody calls when somebody in her hair or whatever and just makes it an unwelcome workplace so we in effect had the effect of ... the real serious stuff of rape and all these things are putting everything the same class what\nAbout Senator Feinstein that this is the way she wants to go out of the end of her career and and and all her so I'll Remember how she got in in Nineteen Ninety two she was elected along with Barbara Boxer and so called dear you're the one woman there were boxer defeated Bruce or just a range dime Abu surgeons in her dear old friend of mine there\nAnd Sean mentioned Feinstein was seen as modern only by comparison your colleague Barbara Boxer all your national leaders\nOf the national scene these two people directly boxer was most pernicious are there and so uh you know Senator Feinstein should be were were were were retiring she's staying I remember just six year term or are there and so these people just never want to leave a national stage as Sean I wanted to ask both of you will Kevin uh yet be confirmed
