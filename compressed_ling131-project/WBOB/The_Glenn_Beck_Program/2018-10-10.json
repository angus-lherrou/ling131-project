[laughter] but um\nYeah so I Wish I did I Wish I did I take it in an interview I didn't even think about it until you know after [noise] right [noise] right [noise] so yeah thanks thanks a lot [laughter] um but what else is going on what do you guys will even gone for about four four\nWeeks station unfortunately my wife is a bad car wreck\nAnd you know we're we're getting ready to roll that out to the community and so we've got a lot of different opportunities that jet and we're really excited to be part of that team can Jason's team so what do you mean by a hundred percent program\nSo uh you remember back in the day when there was a hundred percent holiday okay so that that's what I'm asking yeah so that back in the day now I I Will you\nGo to carry out on this it's not like it was in the past where\nIt's a hundred percent financing and anybody and everybody can do it and there was only ... not not on this one no to now is probably a hundred percent but we're still giving your DNA that's correct yeah which is just to be safe so you know that when your neighbor moves in they've\n... they've qualified for that house but uh we we decided to roll this out because\nUh there's a lot of down payment assistance programs a lot of things out there as well\nBut this hundred percent one lone uh is is you know something that\nI'm not a lot of people have in the market so I'm a hundred percent financing is going to um allow somebody to\nA speed up the the term that they pay it off so it's not a it's not based on the thirty year amateur station which parts so it protects everybody a little bit so that you're not not going to be underwater on that\nStudents grade unique have yet to it\nVery good if people have questions we want you to call in it and I know for to to to talk that's triple to eight to five five give us a call and ask Jason some good questions\nI've got a question what what did you you do a hundred percent financing as the interest rate going to be affected by the fact that everything's being financed or is it about the same as you charge somebody was twenty percent down\n... it it that's a great question it actually almost mirrors where a a regular conventional rate is and um so it's going to be a little bit higher um but there's also an\nOpportunity in that loan to do no no P. M. i.'s well how could I ask you at ... that would be why work you wouldn't get it while you have you have in my uh we can also or you can either financed the ... to buy it out\nOr you can pay that that ... for those who will no means private mortgage insurance and why would people need this oh anytime that ah somebody who's not putting down twenty percent on the loan okay uh the mortgage company any lenders going to have um\nA insurance to protect in case that that loan goes into default and that um that the ... companies would help cover the difference between what that home was was sold at a you know in the foreclosed on ... on the courtyard steps yes\nAnd I know that you don't have a crystal ball but um\nAnd um\nBut I Know our our listeners out there are really curious as to you know with your training and experience where do you think we're headed where do you think the market is headed as far as you know\nHow does it look for us I'm here in the future\nSo the crystal ball the key a key word there and do it nobody has it um but I it from the you know my experience in and just knowledge of the market um you know rates are are none of thirty year rate now is uh it's about the highest it's been eight years so\nUh as of this afternoon we were um you know on on the best out there\nFive percent so I just actually I was reading an article that's the that's the ... the first time that we've hit those levels in about eight years so the question is for anybody that's thinking about buying or you know is now the time and um we while we don't know the crystal ball there's nothing economically\nBut says we're going to get a reversal so you know it's not going to go back down to write three percent worked three and a half percent would you know we've been used to for so many years with you know government money in the market\nSo yeah and for people on the fence because we always have those people that are going I'm not sure to sell I'm not sure to buy\nYou know it's like you need to do it because it's only going to go up you're not going to go back down\nYeah we like I said we nobody has crystal ball but we we all feel that it is probably overdue that the the the rates are back up\nIt is probably overdue that the the the rates are back up\nAnd\nHaving said that we have elections coming up and uh you know I like politics of uh we are a bipartisan here and\nBut I'm I'm really curious as to what the elections how does that impact you know we got one side the says one thing you know the laugh we got the right to says something else and how does that affect um your business and um I\nI Would say the last election and I'll just I'll I'll speak on it\nFrom a a you know what what each side would have meant for the mortgage business so the first side would have been the Hillary side I think that we would have been pro along with interest rates for the you know we would have stayed\nArtificially low and continue to be artificially low and then all of a sudden we would have had potentially a huge increase\nOn the Trump side it was ripped a band aid off let's we know that rates go up so we rip the band aid off\nAnd now we're seeing more gradual so it's not a you know it's not a a you know we're not going to feel the pain all it wasn't no no so we've we've we've continued to see that and you know economically if the can if the\nIf the the economy continues to prosper and continues to to to be boosted I mean you know we we should see higher rates I mean it's it's only it's\nAn economy is getting better at all the way we expect it to go a higher we've got a question from one of our listeners ad argue with me\nEither welcome to rapid fire real estate with Anita aisles hey how are you great thank you\nYou're just a quick question or other ... go great and I have a gift from homes and I I see the U.S staying on some and and I'm not sure what that means ... maybe ... or ... you could explain absolutely [noise] [noise]\n... and they certainly ah thanks for the call it in regards to USDA that\nIs a rural development program that a number one big area in the house that you're purchasing that\nTo be in an area that USDA will lend in so the easiest way to to do that is if you just Google you know USDA property eligibility and put in a specific address that the first way you can you\nCan see if the property you know allows for that\nThe second piece of that is depending on where that property is there's a maximum county um income limits\nSo let's say that uh you've got a a household of for um you know you might be able to go I think the it's it's around Seventy eight Seventy eight thousand so Seventy eight thousand or a family of four correct\nSo it's not it's not meant for 'cause it's a hundred percent financing so you can do up to a hundred for a while and it's like [noise] so\nYeah it's a good deal if he had you know and a lot of people think that you have to be out in the middle of nowhere to get that type of loan but we have actually several places end of all that you can get that type of loan so a lot of it it's just going to the site\nChecking out the ah the ZIP Code or ... or the address and seeing if it does in fact qualify and I'm\nAlone may take a little bit longer not much but just a little bit longer um you know maybe instead of thirty days we're looking at at thirty five or forty day closing um and uh they work out really really nice\nYeah nice you definitely you definitely want to keep up with ... that is one of those programs they will change the maps are pretty much every year so as the population grows that's going to get smaller and smaller that area so that as one you want to jump on\nShook it on your company did that for us\nYes we do USDA financing\nAnd that is ... thank you yes thank you at and that is jet home loans at nine o four five\nFive seven nine nine zero two that's five five seven nine nine zero two jet home loans\nJason thank you so much for being here I Know you're going to stick with us yet we're gonna continue to talk about the amendments and um I Want you to buy than his we're going to talk a little bit about politics or when it comes to the uh to uh obviously we weren't talking about amendments but I'm\nA lot of it pertains to 'em what you do as well so I'm excited about that\nAnd we have\nTomas have menace which last night\nI got to say was amazing at your candidate form I missed your first one uh unfortunately I couldn't get out of an appointment on the first time he had it but I was so impressed last night to see all the candidates there and just be able to mingle and chat with um you know 'cause usually you can't get close\nYeah for sure you've been there since actually exactly the reason why we put it together yeah was for that reason [noise] and when\nWe come back we're going to tell us about last night 'cause you and your family were dynamic\nAnd uh [noise] you have questions we want you to call them I Know for to to to talk that's two two to eight to five five on W. B. O. V. [noise]\n[noise]\nData don't know but as soon as they're going to go to the ballot there's a amendments that this is the most Americans have ever seen on the ballot so I'd I Would probably say that's that's probably accurate but I don't know if it\nWas yeah there's a lot of them and it's so important to you know where I Know we you pass these out last night I got it in front of me it is it twenty Eighteen a nonpartisan voter guide correct um which is a wealth of information because it really does break it down it simplifies that and\nThe league of women voters were actually the ones who who reached out to us um and and offered to bring this just they have this both in English and Spanish\nAnd it was brought to us especially like you don't have to go back to the event but you know we've had some people who have reached out to us just to give support in one way or another with whatever they have and that's\nReally been a a bipartisan effort and this is a a nonpartisan um you know publication an organization and they brought the stairs and I was like wow it's amazing I mean they they just offered to bring it to us for free and I was like yeah put it out there\nWell this is great and um because I Want people to to get a copy of this because all the amendments around here and there is nothing worse than not knowing and going to vote yeah it's terrible you know so this is\nActually on this type of stuff is this is these are very serious items that are on here I don't think we'll get into all of them that we have to want to talk about specifically but there's really a some really important items in here that that people should get on with\nThings can raise your taxes on here and and or not\nAnd so you need to um what's great about this\nIt's a quick summary it's you know it's kind of like getting those little uh you know let in college you get the cliff notes right this is like the cliff notes if you will and it's got good information it breaks it down you're not reading you know ten pages on each amendment right literally\nMaybe two paragraphs though a and a small paragraph somebody to add to that and so um it's good to get a hold of this um and of course you can always Google and read online but I I went online and there's a ... a ... yeah I think there's breaks it\nDown down really nicely and also Republican Party do\nAll county um has and for them because we have two of us in the Republican won that we have here in the studio a break the outlines of breaks down his specifically which amendments a pro Republican Party of Florida\nHas a has endorsed instead to what you should vote yes on so there's a those are available as well off folks need some guidance as far as the opposite should be educated on it they'll just vote and that in one direction but correct that's also some sort of gotten so we have a\nYeah and just don't go I mean you have to do your homework and today we're going to talk about what is related to real estate and we have a mammoth one and so what can you tell us about amendment one\nSure so basically amendment one uh relates directly with a homestead property so as it is right now we have a state of Florida a homestead protection of as one thing but as far as taxation is concerned\nYou have to fifty thousand dollars in homestead exemption so what that means is a it goes tiered based on your value so the first twenty five thousand dollars a value of your homes that are you how do you have right now at a twenty five thousand dollars central that first twenty five thousand dollars\nFrom a fifty thousand a ... from fifty thousand to Seventy five thousand right now you have a twenty five thousand dollar exception exemption for taxes\nAre real property taxes other than school tax so your overall millage really is something that's determined by the district that you're in and do all county for example but on average is Eighteen and Nineteen males\nA six and a quarter of that is his school tax so basically and I know it's kind of convoluted but between fifty in Seventy five right now you'll get that twenty five thousand ordered ocean on the uh everything except for homes to visit me for a for schools\nSo the amendment one seeks to expand that even more to grab another twenty five thousand dollars and if you're properties assess from one hundred thousand two hundred and twenty five thousand and as we heard from earlier the average median price index a lot of things that was a hundred two hundred and twenty thousand dollar sale right now but also true most folks in that average\nWill be eligible to receive that twenty five thousand dollar additional Dutch and on the ... value\nTo that of fifty this would give them Seventy five direct\nBut remember it's not going to be a full exemption because you'd still have to pay the school tax portion which is six and a quarter a mills er which I think basically six dollars for every thousand\nDollars yeah I guess at math it's it's I think it's about a two hundred and fifty dollar savings on an average household um on I Would say we like\nThat you have someone that rain jets especially we're going to be maybe twelve mills on twenty five thousand bucks so right\nSo that's all right you are any little bit it's going to help her and this is gonna be a positive thing for real estate sure [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to talk more about amendment one and two you're listening ... W. B. O. B. give us a call at triple to talk that's triple to talk of rotten W ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise] there are some things you just don't have to do when it comes to buying or selling a home why not\nGo right to the experts rule the executives ocean side is new to the Jacksonville area but globally we have over fifty years of experience were conveniently located in ... three Cronin bulb works out\nOn the corner a beach in grants whether you're listening or buying a home sees it ruled the executive ocean side\nReally executives where the experts are\nTied into the line when when ... when ... things that I Know I Need help finding a home loan counter hung today we offer variety of home purchases refinancing option in Shanghai ...\nRight off I Ninety five and the level of represented in that are dedicated to providing a service when personal aspect guidance throughout you how many new product and gave me a call it and I know for one three seven here nine ... won three things having there and I found\nOut her home loans and eagle having lender\nSomebody who's selling should be a fun and exciting time in your life\nI'm Carrie ... executives ocean side and I would love to be a part of me buying or selling process I give all of my clients world class service in a personalized experience to help you get into your next tone\nGive me a call at nine or ... eight nine four five six to ... that's not enough for eight nine four five six to ... and I will show you the difference call me now and ask about a free free listing home inspection says ... real the executives those inside where the experts are\nAre you stressed about buying or selling your home you don't need to be on a daily ward winning producing real estate agent for relocated back to the ocean side jak ... every day you know and\nThey tend to buying or selling ... and I'll be there for you every step of the way I Know buying and selling your home is a big decision now will ensure is that right to give me a call at night I was born in eighty three eighty seven for the cat to sign up for eight three eighty eight seven four thing you've ever signed an aggy oversee a free listing infection\nHere for a home brew inspections with important information if you're selling your home\nNational Association of realtors\nInspections with important information if you're selling your home\nThe national association of realtors sellers who have their home inspected at the time of listing cell in less time for more money and make do repairs to ask you a real ... about the ...\nRisk free a guarantee of your own prospects enlisting is not sold in six months ... fun one hundred percent of your inspection be going\nTo six eight eight to one one or visit us online\nDot com [noise]\n[laughter] well come back to rapid fire real estate with Anita high almost give us a call ... triple to talk that's triple\nTo eight to five five we'd love to hear from you were talking about amendment one an amendment to things that deal with real estate we've got a Jason here from jet home loans welcome back when he got for us to us what are the size of amendment one are there any bad sides\nWell I mean there's always there's always a good or bad side to everything ah so what what what is estimated is that there will be if if a minute once passed which just to recap is going to give a twenty five thousand dollar exemption from for properties on homestead properties from one or two thousand two hundred and twenty five thousand like in that value\nA so it'll basically a result and giving a\nSix hundred and eighty seven million dollar decreasing funds that will be received by the ... and the cities are and and the counties so that's really the downside to question then becomes obviously where would be if they have it in their budgets now\nHow are they going to balance their budgets and will they need to increase taxes somewhere else so that's another component of it but it would help the actual individual owners themselves on the annual tax\nYou know there has been discussion or that the city governments would simply have to figure out a way to raise taxes elsewhere we could end up saying because of this and increasingly sales tax or more toll roads\nRight exactly and that's and that's exactly that sounds like they got to make it up somewhere now\nWe're already seeing the toll roads come in town right thank you very much and ah ... [laughter] taxing people to get to work on it must have re bite or anything I'm from Southern California so when I got here it's like a toll roads but\nWhat I don't know I'm sure in California if you had a toll road that you will be like a fast of blame you'd be happy to pay Fifteen or twenty dollars just to go through\nTo say what Fifteen dollars to cross that ... that's a whole different country okay I'm from Southern California [laughter] um\nWe do have a toll road but he didn't put one in that back because we do have a fast lane that you have to pay a fortune for\nAn idea that it of course the the course I did I didn't care there was like yeah I get home in our earlier absolute especially there yeah well you can sit in traffic for three hours", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "10"}
