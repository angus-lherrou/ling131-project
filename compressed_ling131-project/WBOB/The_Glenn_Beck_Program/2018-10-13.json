B. O. B. [noise]\n\nWelcome to financial issues I'm Dan serious rate for all of you to join us here we sure do appreciate it for\nI Know we've got an awful lot of listeners in Florida and I know that some of those listeners some of those stations are in the panhandle of Florida in the Big Bend area as well as Florida I'm In ...

that in mind I Would not be with you for the rest of the week or next week we might lose a tower or something but I'm\nNonetheless I Know that we have so many devoted listeners and followers and partners in those areas the first place we were on the air\nIn Florida some years ago was in the panhandle and so that area's a been a good area for us and and uh we are we're we're a love our Florida listeners like all of our listeners and we just hope you stay safe um\nWhere we don't we don't care about your material things we hope you took your your photo albums that's about it but that can all be replaced we just want everybody to get out of harm's way and stay safe [noise]\nUh and I did hear that is now a category for right now the Dallas having the worst day it said since June twenty fifth June twenty fifth\nWhen you think about it not that old and it's not that big of a deal but nonetheless um June twenty fifth the Dow is down a considerably here this morning or\nAs you know there's been some pretty good economic news doesn't matter everybody's watching a couple of other things said trade a political upheaval and volatility on the political front so and so forth all those kinds of things way into negativity still kind of ridiculous to me but I Want you to think about something\nThat they are still over twenty six thousand that's number one don't know if it'll last but it is right now the doubts down three hundred and forty one points\nI remember a day when the Dow is down three hundred and forty points that we would be oh my word it's only one point two percent\nIt's not a huge amount to anything over one percent of significant so we need to be concerned a little bit but we're a long way off from this year's ties but nonetheless a or a long way away from going to this week years lows we could we could do it today we could do it tomorrow\nBut anyway we're trying to get a handle on all of this is happening I don't see the rationale behind this\nSo we'll see gold is slipping obviously wise goals slipping wait a minute if anything else is crashing shouldn't go be going up yeah probably because that signals or a ski area or a worst economy goals are not going anywhere but damn producer price index jumped and maybe that's got something\nGoing anywhere but damn producer price index jumped to maybe that's got something to do with it here's why\nProducer price index goes up four tenths of one percent they're expecting it to go up to ten to one percent producer price index now we're making an assumption that these producers are going to

from Louisiana\nDid I say that God Bless you love all that you do think you can um I I really do appreciate that interesting on YouTube\n\nA comment that said uh George from North Carolina said a tried for years to be a biblical responsible ah with investments found it very difficult to get any pertinent information on the subject is very very hard and it's a little bit easier now but not much a tool I discovered in an F I S M\nThank you Dan\nThank you George I appreciate it that's great stuff another George different George says Dan I'm I'm not older remember what happened I don't know what he's talking about is probably probably typed it as I was saying something um then but whatever became of the moral majority\n[noise]\nHe told me about the movement the moral ... majority um that is a good that is a good question I have an answer I don't feel comfortable answering the question\n[laughter] just be I'm just being honest with you George but I ... a ... because a number one it's um\n\nSomething I don't understand I kinda do and I don't um [noise] and it's something that is extremely frustrating to me so I'm a stay away from it and I'll probably end up saying something that I'd be sorry I said so I won't talk about it but I Will say this the majority\nThe moral majority is alive and well and that as you and I George was alive and well with the presidential elections there was a moral majority not the movement but the people\nThe evangelical Christians that changed the world you change the world you know that when you voted in the last you change the world if you voted for President Trump you change the world you change the face of the Supreme Court for an entire generation praise God for my grandchildren thank you\nFor changing the world or the Supreme Court for that but we change the world this president is kept his promises and it's going to continue to do so\nBut listen we need him to have a Congress\nThat is going to live and uphold and continue to further his agenda it is critically important that we have a Congress that is going to stand by this president\nSo you know where I'm going right it has never been more critically important to vote than this November election it's just true\nSo you in the next twenty eight days you better come out and vote or twenty seven whatever it is you better come out and vote because we got to keep this going this moral majority we got to keep it going\nAnd you are responsible for doing that you if you've never voted in a midterm election before I let this be the first just make sure you do it\nSo all of the all of you that voted in the last presidential election us better vote now because the leftist fired up to the to the likes of which we've never seen and we see what they're fired up about the far far left\nI said last night to somebody socialism socialism\nI said you're worried about socialism we better be worried about communism within every worry about fascism we better be worried about Marxism\nWe may be getting to the point depending on how elections go we may be getting to the point where we will wish\nWe had socialism this\nSocialism go like the greatest thing in the world compared to the road that we are going down\nSocialism this isn't a vote against socialism this is a vote against something far worse we can't let it happen and we have\nThis is a vote against something far worse\nWe can't let it happen and we have the power we have the power not to let it happen [noise]\nAll right let me go to the phones then we go to Robert Robert calling us from Louisiana hey Robert\nHow are you down I'm going to tell you\nThat my father was really worried about the economy collapsed than eat eat eat dog ten years ago but you know both me and my sister thirty six or seven houses that goal\nUh-huh each okay a ... wherever you go to sell that if that was your goal\nIs that was my and I would go to a website called but it's a a pie and he acts a P. M. E. X. dot com answer and um [noise] I I only say that for this reason\nUh for years and years I have bought and sold a little bit of goals little bit of silver from them\nThey're very reputable but but here's what I like about um\nThey're not predators you don't ever have to talk to anybody if you don't want to and I love that notion [noise]\nUm and they will it's on their website what they're going to buy your vote for it's published so you know right away whether you're being taken are not from a commission perspective and I like that [noise]\nThe other thing is it gives you an easy opportunity say okay this is what I can sell the [noise] uh uh making these numbers up but for the sake of the example gold is selling ad\nYou know eleven hundred and Ninety eight and they want to give me eleven hundred and fifty that's a pretty fair price they got to make some money that's fine but this other person wants to give me eleven hundred even\nThis other person wants to give me ten o nine\nThen you've got a factor in the shipping costs because you not only have to mail it to them unless you want to get in a car and drive I think there in Florida for ... sake and unless you want to get in the car and drive\nUm you can do that but not only do you have to mail it you've got a short and the insurance is very expensive because you got to shore for the full value when you're ... so you know that that's an issue the best place other than that\nIs a local gold dealer because you're going to get your best place prices from a local gold dealer\nUm that that is going to buy buy it from you for just a probably a little bit below par\nOr below spot price so that's where you're going to get your ... best price the downside is that your local gold dealer is not going to have the ability probably not going to have the ability to buy all thirty six\nOunces at one time you know they're going to want to stretch it out but from a price perspective it's going to be the best place to get your you know to get your best price that's going to be the best place to do it at a local dealer if you can find one\nSo I had a a dealer once I had a the task this was way way many many years ago when I was a still managing a and and our trust company and and sewing and you know a managing a lot of money and I had a client\nThat had\nSo much silver or her whole entire king sized bed the entire floor space onto the mat mattress was filled with silver\nAnd it's a wonder ... gave it to be honest with you and you know we sold out all the local dealer\nBut we had to um do it a little bit at a time but there was a local dealer at a local flea market that um\nYou know gave us a very good price on it and that's how she's someone with but\nThat's what I Would look at but they're not going to go in and write you a check for forty thousand dollars to sell it all at once in all likelihood they're gonna want to do a little bit of time so I Would look locally\nAnd see if there's a you know take a little bit of your goal test it out you know take an ounce and go over and so she was going to sell her for the next I buy for taking take two ounces so am I have\nSome cash as well uh I have a ... percent by ... Seventy thousand dollars in cash and I don't want to go put it and the market right now but as you know going down and I lose my mind [laughter]\nRight and I want a dollar cost averaging that that's probably the best thing for me to do I ever saw that in one of those down\nIt would be how old are you Robert of Oregon on\nYeah so yeah that's the best thing to do you know you have a few stocks try to you know get some small positions in a few stocks and then good stocks good solid sucks and over the next year\nYou know take a little bit of time as it's going down to a dollar cost averaging down um and maybe you know when there's another style when it's going up up up maybe there's another stock you can buy that or you know near a bottom that you can buy and you know\nBut I I Would very slowly and gradually start moving I didn't but only move that into some things that are very strong very strong\nVanguard or you have to get a brokerage it to our band or and you can do it on your own as a low cedar box ... correct\nDied asset allocation motto\nIs how you follow it it's going to say that you need to have\nYou should have are making these numbers up six percent in energy stocks you should have five percent and um I don't know mature industrial stuff and then you as you work\nTowards that you're going to look on my list and all my by list everything's marked you'll know what the energy and what is an energy and what's industrial and what isn't so and so forth\nAnd you begin may be a you have to have seven percent in energy put three percent of your money into one stock and energy maybe into stocks in energy\nAnd start to ... you know do very little at a time and build one little sector of that pie chart that acid allocation Moscow\nThen move onto the next sector and just take your time and start to get a feel for how it all works\nI don't want to say that well I don't want to say about it is easy but it's only easy if you read\nEverything and you're and you're listening to watch the videos and take your time you know try to do it or in too much of a hurry then it starts to come to your relatively easy it's important that you start with a little bit of money\nAnd do it very slow and then just watch ... and take your time yeah\nYeah so ... I I Am fifty thick and my husband at Seventy one so we don't\nDo much we don't travel we don't do anything I just basically saved my money and the last twenty Thirty years so we're in that spot\nBut I have like a lot of I have a wealth manager with uh with ... and I know I'm I Know they're not that the response\nAll like to take that out of Reagan and then that that and then I have a four O. one thank God but there are they so I can change that over to the Kennedy clan\nI'm saying well you know let's get\nRight I Would follow your age ...\nTo\nDo yeah yeah yeah it was after work and I'm not retiring and the gotcha okay I agree that five years but um but my question is they add to that money from rage and then it's about\nSix hundred mhm if I took that money without just immediately say on that over that that Delaney and about you know invest in\nIt and according to your stop that or whatever but I just go ahead and really that up according to your\nDifferent sectors are yeah I was little\nNo I Would do I would do um maybe twenty percent of it across all such sectors okay and then maybe in a couple\nOf months do another twenty percent I wouldn't rush into it [noise] okay so when you put that money in the new brokerage account that fertility it's going to all go into a money market account\nSo it's going to be sitting in the money market account now if it's already invested in different things\nYou may want to bring it over to the new account it's called in Colleen\nSo let's say you have shares of XYZ mutual fund you have ABC mutual fund you have one two three stock you have four five six stock you have all these different stocks ... it'll come over just like it is now\nI'll be any changes you still have all those positions then\nBecause it's cheaper to sell out of those positions on fidelity than it will be a region is going to charge a lot of money to do that so so you don't want it converted all the cash ... costs too much money but you can bring it over and begin to sell it gradually so that you can become biblical responsible\nOkay if you if you if you say to yourself in this process you don't want to do this that I I you know I don't I\nDon't have a financial I have one financial advisor\nThat you can work with to do the same thing you did a region these differences this person is going to keep you biblical responsible and she's going to follow my plan because that's how she manages all her clients and um you can ask pat\nJust email padded financial issues die to work and she'll give you the information if you want to go that route\nOkay great is it\nSomebody locally or this or no it's somebody that's got clients all over the country but look even if they're around the corner you don't use the telephone [noise]\nRight right you might not have had that bless the thank you all that money on the phone for a fact you listeners we sure for sure [noise]\n\nFolks we've got to be afraid we're going to be praying for a measure said all those sorts of flowers I indicated the top of the hour\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou know what you were supporting when you purchase mutual funds which stocks [noise] think about\nWhen you invest in companies do make a decision to support the things that come with us\nFrom may not be things would you agree we had no\nIdea that we were supporting things like abortion gambling and pornography\nThinks the financial issues we've changed all of that ended up never feel better about our money we're honoring God\nThe best decision we've ever made financial issues with some really screen teaching people want you to invest biblical\nResponse from keeping you were in Bush was clear companies with makes are born God [noise]\nGrow your money goes to\nLearn more about going to financial issues not or become a park and honor guard and take control of your financial financial issues daughter [noise]\nReborn dot org is one of the greatest ministries I Believe that is saving the lives of baby\nThe unborn would you go to ... not in the word right now considering a hundred and forty dollars will allow all five young mothers teachers on the other baby changing their mind that she was like\nRewarded Don reborn dot anyway\n[noise] [noise] Hi this is here in Studio ...\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi this is the ensue from finance you were saying I Hope they will consider partnering with financial issues one of the things that you're going to get from that is access to our by lists the access to our cell is you're going to become educated about the economy\nAnd the testimony from people just like you I Hope humans that are going to financial issues dot org\nEntering with his ministers that financial issues dot org\nYou'll billions of recommendations which is not necessarily represent the station for you the truth [noise]\nAbout ah somebody\nOn Facebook or YouTube I'm not sure and see where is it you\nKnow Facebook ...
