I haven't told anybody else already I'm yeah I'm kind of stuck up there in Maine see today\nAnd anybody else already um John's kinda stuck up there in Maine the today because I cannot be into play for that one time I did try\nI always heard you're an absolute miracle worker\nYeah um yeah well I'm I've been accused of using different kinds of witchcraft but unfortunately [laughter] that's so great that you're right it I you know I have some special power but that they're\nAll right are you are down at the arena at the moment or I Believe uh finishing up my little details\nBut I Am I Am on my way to the arena and I'd\nBeen storming like crazy and and that we keep hearing over for for ambulances apparently there quite a few accidents out here\nAnd those are those voter guide and the uh the yard signs are available at that location we get tons of calls about that and speaking of calls George I see you're on the\nDeli line Martin how are you today George\nAlright I'm of the people of Venezuela heart but this morning a woman from Venezuela called ... and said\nThat the socialist government down there it's turned into a dictatorship is always happens I've worked overseas in poor countries a number of them were socialist [noise]\nAnd they were all headed toward dictatorships and my question is why the socialist countries always turn into dictatorship and the answer is they don't work\nExactly the economy crash if you don't and even with no drug restriction drugs in a pharmacy almost no food in the uh [noise] uh in in the grocery stores and we've seen videos of\nOf teenagers fighting over the scraps out of dumpsters which are behind the restaurant where the final ruling elite stay [noise]\nAnd so when the economy is failing they bring out the strong arm and they start a country doing everything they can to control the people\nAnd it is a fallacy for kids to be taught that socialism is great when if you actually study it you find that it always always fail\nGeorge and one of the things that I'm ed is happening here in the governor's race and I've heard folks say that well that I'm a Mr Gillum is a a a socialist than I Do not believe that he is truly a socialist however he does is linked to lean toward the\nSome socialistic um um the the ideals and uh I don't believe we can can even start that road toward\nThose those things that he wants a sand and I'm In his campaign and his his campaign has there been very straightforward about telling you what do you use a intended showed so no one on this side of the um the fences is making up things to uh to uh\nPaint a Mr dealing with a with a bad rap and he has come right out and said I'm well one of the things is um he wants to legalize I'm I'm a recreational marijuana or went to\nThat one or just keep people spaced out like in California San Francisco so they do actually checking the details of what their elected officials are doing with their money\nAnd they ... they stay in a fog and I've been in a few countries are a few countries like that or whether it's just too much radiation from cell phones and the kids there's\nA smart meters which I'm finding that right now people are really upset and California about it are flat just lying to people and and making sure that the media does not cover\nWhat's really happening happening that Israel socialism and what Gillian Roth is just more and more power\nYes I'm like you George I'm I was in the navy for a number of years a little over twenty five years\nAnd I managed to um to make it one world cruise um those circle navigation of the uh uh the globe um and I can now I'm here to attest to the world is round it just not flat there somewhere we're trying to tell us [noise]\nAnd um I've got just gotten the opportunity to see how people live at street level I'm at a in different countries I'm In ... the\nPeople here in the United states have really never seen poverty\nI have I have seen poverty edits um edits absolute worst um I remember one time that uh uh we were talking with the um the military attache in one of the embassies that he had come aboard the ship and said you know what are you guys planning on doing well\nThe embassies that he had come aboard the ship and said you know what are you guys planning on doing well what we told him we had been out and in certain sections of the city and he says don't go there he says your life is not worth five cents and some of these places that if you've got a\nA gold wedding ring on or\nSort of wealth or you are an infinite target he says don't do it and\nI always end up with a shining path the socialist communism and likely that people walk up and they said ah we're we're we're not going to do this\nAnd then the Columbia with the FARC uh the communist and they were fighting with the drug cartels and the dark curtails for fighting with the with the ah the main government and they got kind of improve the country when we help them but the FARC still is in the government now\nAnd Mexico ah with with hit very hard in the twenties and thirties with people coming over from Russia\nOr to turn out the schools and the government and the media and to a communist state\nAnd they're still fighting fighting with that one uh Lewis and proving to to some degree and I just wish that every child could have the opportunity to spend two or three years and one of these countries and see how bad it is\nYes and in reality living there and [noise] and ah I just I have come to the collision that people just don't know and I when I walked door to door or a candidate for the most important questions I ask if what is it that you want\nWhat are your big issue and then you can go from there talking about why a conservative Republicans have a better way of dealing with the world than the socialist leading to communism lead into dictatorship\nOr George how how often do you have someone to tell you a question like that or I Would really rather prefer that I'm ... stayed out of my life\nWell actually I walked a lot of district Democrat ... it with was Republican and Ninety eight percent of the people there\nSaid they agreed with having a four one K. type system\nOr where they could have money to retire that they wanted the school system actually taught the kid something they could use 'em in in uh in life and work and they actually went down through a lot of things we promote but many of them are Democrats and they just really didn't understand\nHow their party was not moving towards the facts\nYes that would be my main goal I Would like to see less and less government all the time because the greater the government intrusion into all of our lives are I don't think is terribly beneficial now granted there must be regulations because there are\nActors on both sides that are that if you don't have some stronger regulations that points um they will they will try to um\nUh become [laughter] ... almost an an Amazon or a monopoly a monopoly if\nYou will you know they were all starting to understand government was the problem is I was talking to them and they didn't necessarily understand that when I started in ... I looked at the the Fox poll last night and they said number one is a health care health and health care and number two the the economy [noise]\nAnd um what we've seen to two groups pop up that would really caught medical care and a half and give us a better way of dealing with things one is\nAt the same day out in Wichita, Kansas and Sean Hannity who pushing they're there for years fifty dollars a an adult from a ... for the doctor can for children\nAnd then they cut their um make your medical in other words going to the hospital down and half down there by six thousand where people don't realize they and their ... their employer paying ... anywhere from ten to twelve\nAnd the other as a matter of share which you're sharing system for for a for Christians and it's on it's advertised on this station another station\nAnd when you go through and start telling them that you know the facts you start telling exact figure good grief I uh maybe I'll talk to my boss of out of\nA ... a ... than a I'm a ... it's it's amazing is that the folks want a lot of things and it's always available until the socialist run out of someone else's money\nYeah Margaret Thatcher said that she [laughter] socialism worked in Delhi runs out of other people's money does it produce and so you end up with the country bankrupt actually which is what is happening even for a while and\nThen the uh the government takes over and it becomes a dictatorship and they will tell you and they're in the last throws at that time of um of the the viability of the country it is it is starting to collapse on its own weight\nAnd um it really gets ugly after that started or inside thank you for calling in\nA and our next segment we'll talk about the ballot amendments and are those Republican candidates stay tuned we'll be right back [noise]\nThe pizza or folks up in battle creek\nAnd if I remember right that was a Steve's takeout pizza\nAnd or is it a what a what would it take to um um the the UPS some

that to this and that is but his program would really create\nA thousands of jobs\nAnd I'm Mr gallons would almost cost that to many jobs I'm Mr Jones proposal one or two a a corporate tax increase increase the minimum wage increase or teachers' salaries um and ah\nHad a lot of other it's on the surface wonderful thing because it seems like wonderful things it sounds like it would be a great thing to increase the I'm a teacher salaries I don't have any heartburn about that but to do it\nA mystery almost to um [noise] a number one uh legalize marijuana and tax it er which I'm totally
