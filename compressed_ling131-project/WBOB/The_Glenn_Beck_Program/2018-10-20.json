appreciate it [noise]\nWe've got phone lines open a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three\nIt is said Tambor tense\nMarkets are flat nothing happening so that's where we got nothing\nHappening hey we've got a lot of economic do them in a data coming out this week\nOr the most important piece of economic data this is just my opinion\nTo pieces I'll say one I'm kind of a non event I really don't care I I Do care very much about it it's very important but I'm reasonably certain going to be good I probably shouldn't say that\nBut and if I'd be the small business administration small business not administration small business than National Federation of independent businesses small businesses index\nAre coming out confidence index coming out and um\nI it's ... it's going to stay out by I Can't imagine this is an August number were sitting in one of seven point nine or ... wait for all practical purposes\nCan't see go much below that can't see him going much above that but it should probably I think the needles you move up a little bit from one o seven point not just because of the numbers that we've seen the other really important numbers industrial production and that's coming out that's also an August number\nSo industrial production or one of the most important numbers we have in our economy\nOr something we watch very closely or we should be watching now we got in the habit of ignoring it or not we shouldn't say way I don't wanna throw me in that category 'cause I never ignored it but um then the mainstream a financial news gotten the habit of ignoring it because I'm\nThe industrial production numbers kinda contradicted everything that was happening in the Obama administration so\nUh what all the things they were a towel team a defeat the industrial production contradicted it and you do not by the way you do not a a economy almost any economy but American economy\nHas no growth and left industrial production um and and and productivity if those two things aren't up you know really have any growth you could say at gross you know you say I've grown up and you can pretend like you have grows you can do that too\nBut\nYou don't have any growth was it an interesting how this\nPresident Obama\nTalking about this good economy is because I Am wait a minute all the Democrats are saying if the economy stinks\nAll the Democrats on the stump say this economy is not good having you say it's good and they're not and they they got a thousand reasons why this isn't a good economy\nSo ... ... ... who's right here so then\nPresident Obama didn't create a good uh got Oh yes you get well then it does it's like oh no it stinks\nJust say just thought I'd throw that out um\nI just found that interesting because you got the Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on one side say and all the Trump hasn't done anything what is he talking about what a time and you've got\nSay and all the Trump hasn't done anything what is he talking about what a time and you've\nGot President Obama saying oh this is you know economy is good but keep in mind that's their mind number\nOkay\nAll right they're going to have to fight that look if the if the left it was had any sense whatsoever\nThat would just kind of drift right on by right through this how about wanting to just keep talking about Russia how about\nThat because you're just making fools you yourself talking about the economy so want it to use it for the November election talk about some got to be something out there you can talk about um\nLet me think why don't you talk about um abolishing nice how about that how would you talk about the evils\nHas moved up and they're spread between the ten and the two year has increased not a lot but by about ten basis points they're sprayed has increased and basis points a basis point is one Honduras one basis point is one\nHundredth of a percent\nSo when you see the fate is raising twenty five basis points that's a quarter of one percent\nSo the the um sprayed between the ten year and the two year is increasing you know everybody was talking to me and I didn't spend a lot of time on this because I didn't want to talk about it because I didn't think I thought it was irrelevant 'cause I didn't think it was going to happen and it didn't but they're spread between the two year and a ten year\nHas grown and continues to grow well let's hope we can hold\nSo yes the ten year moved up the yield but and so did the two year but the two year didn't move up at the same rate that\nThe ten year did so therefore the difference the gap increase and that's a good thing as we look at the economy and I'm Sorry I don't have that uh exact number in front of me\nYou know what I might have it so I Do about that so the ten year this morning hates wow three point to one point to one early this morning\nSo the two year at a hit two point eight eight I remember when the ten year was two point eight eight this year not too long ago\nSo but they're sprayed had changed so the ten year increase five point seven basis points the two year increase to point for basis points so that increase that difference between the two in the tent and that's very good\nAt the Federal Reserve power spoke yesterday and he said the economy is a long way away from neutral\nNow maybe some of you heard that maybe some of your rate some things about that because I Know you're so much more in tune with economic dated because you listen to this program but let me just explain to you and I hope you are\nSo neutral when you hear the term neutral when the Federal Reserve talks about it he's talking about the point at which\nInterest rates this is their interest rates going up like they did last week raising the interest rates neither\n\nAffect the markets where the economy in a good way nor do they affect the economy in a bad way\nWell that's kind of what happened I Believe last week it really had no impact on the economy one way or another but the fed says no that up a chairman pal says no that is not the case at all we are a long way away from\nWe're a long way from neutral\nBeing that whenever the fed does really doesn't impact the markets that much\nThe one thing I wanted to mention it to you and I I did a two minute on this and then I deleted it because it sounded too much it's sad to\nSay on the two sarcastic can mean and mean spirited so I guess I was very early it was three o'clock this morning so I listen to it and then I think so but basically what I was talking about what's shaping Morgan\nCame out and said that talked to was an article say J. B. Morgan says that ah the because of the Federal Reserve market cap and yes I'm be has lost one point five trillion dollars\nIn that uh Shea who cares\nYou really care for in the market was that when they asked me was is up fourteen percent Fifteen Percent over the last ... months\nOnly a bank could whine about that there's a bank that has been living off cheap money for so long impacting their bottom line making billions and billions and billions and billions of\nDollars for the banks are over the last seven years ... these are the same fat cat bankers the President Obama despise were making so much money off of President Obama\nAnd they're whining about it oh no\nIt's going to be terrible and oh my gosh he has to be the only up\nAbout it oh no it's going to be terrible and oh my gosh yes and be the only ups who cares about whether or money is impacting banks in the way they how much profit they are making\nAnd I thought they what I all I could think about was what a ridiculous statement to make Ninety two percent of people surveyed this year they don't trust their bank\n\nNow you know why this would be one of the reasons this is why I talk about Christian Community credit union you're still dealing with a regular old bank but not the only Christian Community credit union you need to think twice about that I wrote an article about it when the survey came out a couple of months ago about\nThis notion that Ninety two percent of the people that's worse than the snow rating in Congress\n\nI mean Congress ratings are higher than that not by a lot but there are higher than that there are at least somewhere in the low double digits eleven percent or so\nI guess Congress has more family and friends than do bankers\nAnd there are whining about what the fed the phage speaking in a very hawkish tone this is me saying this is not the banks not to be Morgan but it's what\nThey alluded to speak it in a very hawkish tone we've seen drops like we did yesterday at forty four\nPoint forty four percent\nOh my gosh are almost half a one percent drops because the fed is losing market cats\n\nJust why people don't like the ... so I don't know bags front on ... I have a couple of small community banks are but that's it and that was the first time in twenty five years when I put those by an extra my broad list some\nFour or five years ago [noise] other than prefer\nAre going to make one quick comment about prefer somebody asked me about this about preferred going down and is it a good sign to buy short is if you're in an income portfolio\nFrom our website the income portfolio yeah it's a good time to um add to some of your prefers but remember why you're doing an income portfolio so what do you care about income what do you try to do get income what are you trying to do supplement your current income\nWhat you're trying to do increase your um a cost of\nLiving your your your spending that you had your discretionary income by getting your money to work for you by generating income that you're getting paid out on a regular basis and that income is using to supplement your\nYour all your other income that you received and that's why you're trying to do it so why do you care whether it goes down to twenty two dollars for twenty five twenty dollars Eighteen dollars what do you care\nThe idea is forget about the principal keep the income flowing that's all that matters you're doing it for income it's going to come back\nOr it's going to get called you're going to get twenty five dollars a share but please don't get discouraged if you get discouraged you shouldn't be in an income portfolio I've said this a thousand times I'm going to say it again because I keep getting emails about it if you care that much about your value\nPlease cell now and get into growth stocks and stop getting into income stocks because you obviously don't need income you need to grow some more and if you're looking for grossed out of your income positions that are on my list your barking up their own choice because it is going to happen\nSo\nAlso I Want to mention somebody mentioned to me that I have a stock highlighted in blue that is it an income stocks but it's also a foundational stock and he asked the question was well it's a foundational stock as if a foundational stock couldn't be an income stuck\nSo if you look very closely at those highlighted in blue that are foundational stocks\nAnd I granted I don't blame anybody it's kinda hard to see trying to figure out a better way to do it maybe I'll Try change it to read or something but I had the fond\nDu lettering on that stock is in yellow\nPride in case indicate that it is a foundational stock maybe I ought to highlight the whole thing and yellow and maybe put the letter and blew that might be better maybe I should try that\nBut at this point I hate to confuse people but um that's that's okay that's happened to be a growth suck but the income that produces is very good and and I would consider it an income stock\nBut in the same line of thinking you can't be worried about growth you're doing it strictly for income there'll be worried about growth if you're doing it for growth and you happen to get that income that's a wonderful thing\nOh let me go to Cathy Cathy calling us from Michigan had Cathy\nHi your money and you hear me yes\nOkay um well I had a question I have a raw IRA\nAnd I'm the one\nAnd I'm Wondering about the case and I have and that but under\nThat Seventy percent on ten percent and never meant money market twenty percent so when do you think you're going to use the money\nOh not anytime soon\nI'm Sorry what was that ... and I still\nOkay [noise] um yeah I mean I think that's fine I mean I I don't um you know I mean I think that's fine but it's pretty aggressive\n\nAnd they've got to continue to protect those dairy farmers are they going to lose their vote and if they lose their votes are going to lose the election\nIt's not too hard to figure out that they're not going to compromise very willingly now after the elections they may compromise but they're not going to compromise now\nNow hopefully they can come to terms or do something some kind of be getting a compromise maybe make a promise it's not going to be a public promise but maybe make a promise to the United states that are going to revisit\nThis in a year and a half I don't know when there are elections [noise] or or over check it out John Kennedy was elected\nTheir their elected prime minister one today it anyway [noise]\nSo maybe they can make some sort of promise they want some relief on steel and aluminum we want some relief on lumber some relief on on a dairy\n\nGet there's plenty to negotiate all they want some relief on this whole idea of arbitration sort of Mexico\nWe've got to have that I Believe that rules that are important role and we got to have the ability to negotiate or to our betrayed uh some violation in some way shape or form without having to renegotiate the entire deal\nI think we've reached compromise on the length of the deal how long this deal is going to last I think we reach some agreement on that\nSo we're making headway but we gotta keep plugging away and we got to hope that we'd come alongside the you right now I don't understand why we can't make start to make some individual deals right now without making it overriding deal when Europe\nOffered us no tariffs on automobiles either way we should have taken it [noise] President Trump said it's not enough it's OK let's talk about what's left and negotiate that as well\n\nBut he's quick to say it's ... will just make a separate deal with Mexico how about we just make a separate deal on cars with Europe and make separate deals on the hill with Europe and make separate deals on batteries with your makes separate deals on on a windmills\nWith your I mean that's just going to do that that will take each deals they\n\nWere not going to get to a place where there's no tariffs on anything for anybody\n\nThat's not going to happen I Can't believe the president's would be naive enough to think that's going to happen I don't think he is I'm sure he's ... he's got enough smart people I Know some of them around them then aren't going to work on a by that\nI Would think\nEuropean stocks I don't know where they finished the day by European stocks were lower early on in the day China's got major issues right now they're talking about just they're just one point five points away from being in contraction mode\nIn their in their service sector\nThat is a huge problem since they've been working feverishly trying to build their service sector so that they can grow their economy to service sector and not all to manufacture and not be so heavily dependent upon manufacturing exports\nWell guess what it's dropping quick why because nobody's got any money\nThey're losing their discretionary income as a matter of fact a lot of people in China losing their income altogether we're not hearing about that we can you hear about that that that we have no way of hearing about that\nBut we got to know that they're manufacturing a production is slowing down the service sector now slowing down that means people are losing jobs that means people are starving to death for literally\n[noise] so\nThere's gotta be room for negotiation in these areas\nNow we've got worries about emerging markets we see South Africa's economy slipping into a recession kinda snuck up on everybody what's the next we've got to worry about some of the other emerging markets\n\nThen we've got currency issues with emerging markets that we've got to be concerned about\n\n[noise] anyway [noise]\nWe've got to look at what the individual investors what consumers wife was um [noise]\nPhysicist investment as looking like that sort of these are going to be very very very important numbers [noise] this month [noise] to see if there's been\nSome

[noise]\nTalking\nBack financial issues aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three fourths at news media\nUm well the the a conservative news media what what little bit there is left is talking about\nUm\nThe buildup of China's military and they've been talking about it for a little while last couple of weeks um [noise] I saw an article coming out of a Greek a newspaper that was printed in English talking about this very thing\nBecause they're concerned Greece concerned about the navy built up [noise]\nUm you know China's goal and you might not know this is that by in Twenty years to a completely control um\nHave the power to control the oceans are with the naval build up or they want total control right now today over the Asia Pacific and um\nThey they pretty much have that and uh you may or may not know earlier this year I think it was yesterday maybe it was early this morning but yesterday I'm\nAlmost collided with a navy destroyer\nI'm In international waters that was over in the Asia Pacific uh and you can actually see a satellite photographs\nOf the two ships now satellite photograph so the depth perception is not the best but by looking at the photograph it looks like they are unbelievably close so I'm sure there are very close and you know the the um\nChina needs they will protect those oceans and the Asia Pacific in any means I can\nAnd they continue a massive you think you know we're going through a military build up here that is up about forty years overdue we've got a navy that is equivalent to what
