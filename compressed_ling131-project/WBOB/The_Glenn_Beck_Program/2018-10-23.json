to be back [noise]\nUm phone number for the ah to call in is to to to talk to two to eight to five five lots going on in the insurance world today um and in general\nWe have a\nWe have healthcare dot Gov has been doing a major update to their ah to their system a there's a there's a lot of uh there's a lot of upgrades and updates on that ah they're\nThey're making it easier for the insurance companies and individual agents to ah to log in and help people enroll\nI'm getting to the point where they're actually looking at the possibility I'm In the next year or two where you can only go to healthcare dot Gov is an individual just to find out what the plans are generating quote see what it might cost but\nWhen it comes time to enroll uh they're they're actually looking at the possibility of just forwarding everybody to a licensed agent to make sure that you're getting enrolled properly into the right plan and pain to correct premiums for your needs a so that's pretty interesting pretty exciting\nOr some\nOther things that are happening on to the last couple of weeks you haven't been able to you may have not been able to get bogged into health care doc out and the reason for that is to not being in the in the news too much but they got hacked that's right they got hacked so they ah they took a lot of on line a log in and out of the uh out of the mix\nUntil they were able to fix things and I think to back up and running as of a little bit earlier this afternoon\n[noise] so we're ah we're into the open enrollment window for ah for Medicare right now there is a there's a lot of options that are that are out there for retirees and for those people who are about to retire\nUm it can get confusing it can get daunting and a and you can you can get paralyzed and not act when and then get stuck into a into a bad selection\nOr a or a bad choice with Medicare you know there are are there are three that when you get when you're on your road to Medicare there's\nIt ends up that there's three pass 'em that you can or that you can take original Medicare that's where it's government pays eighty percent you pay twenty percent and you buy a prescription drug plan\nYeah that's like the model T Ford of ah of Medicare options it is the old option it's the one that leaves you exposed for twenty percent of the hall of the medical expenses\nIt's not that bad if you have a thousand dollar bill and you just kind of reach into your pocket for two hundred dollars when you get that hundred thousand dollar bill he got to reach into your pocket for twenty thousand\nOr you have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar bill and you're having to reach into your pocket for fifty thousand well that's that's that's where that's where that option starts to fall by the wayside and and you realize you may have not had the or you may have not chosen the right way um\nThe path to call that the Cadillac that's where you're getting a a\nSupplement or a ... plant uh that's where the government you're still on original Medicare they're still going to cover that first eighty percent but now you have a an insurance company coming in and they're going to pick up that remaining twenty percent you're out of ...\nYou have a an insurance company coming in and they're going to pick up that remaining twenty percent you're out of pocket is zero\nAnd I'm going to tell you right now it's a great feeling when you go to the doctor or you have to go into the hospital for surgery and you come out and they say thank you so much hope you're you know you're going to be feeling better by the way here's your the there's no bill you're not going to pay anything\nSo there's a there's there's quite a bit of a it's quite a bit of comfort and joy and knowing that you go to the doctor and they're never asking you for a dime\n[noise] ah\nSo the the plan that does that is the F F planters and Frank\nI'm there are changes coming to Medicare regarding the supplement plans\nBut you know you get a you get a policy here real world example quoted a young lady yesterday evening she was twenty eight years old\nA five hundred thousand dollars of a term policy around sixty two dollars a month\nWhat a great price sixty two dollars a month for about five hundred thousand dollars in a in a in monthly premium and then that policy we were able to take it all the way out to age Seventy\nSo she's twenty eight that policies going this is going to live is going to last for forty two years she's going to pay ride around thirty thousand dollars in premium for in our lifetime and when she turned Seventy years old and she's still alive\nShe's going to get thirty thousand dollars back one hundred percent no questions asked the insurance companies just going to write a check and send it to her\nNow I don't know to me it's kind of a no brainer he get a return a premium he'd get a hundred percent of your money back\nAnd then you can use it for whatever you want\nYou can buy another life insurance policy and he didn't make it a paid up policy so you don't have any premium payments\nYou can take a cruise you can take your family on a cruise you can take a vacation that you've always wanted to take and you might say to yourself well gosh you're Seventy years old oh trust me I Know a lot of Seventy year old retirees that travel a lot\nAnd they go to a lot of interesting places and thirty thousand dollars you can take it to a lot of those interesting places\nSo again when you're talking about life insurance you know make sure you're getting the right policy that's going to do the right thing for you at that point in time but you also should be looking at down the road as well and make sure that it's also going to do the right thing for you down the road you know\nOr if you're if you're if you're looking at if you're young you're in your thirties and you're saying to yourself you know hey I'm I'm a Mac sitting out my four oh one K. at work\nI'm putting money into a Roth IRA I'm I'm getting a maximum that out I don't know what else to do and I still have a little bit of extra money well then my recommendation\nAfter a good conversation would be\nHey we should be looking at a permanent policy that's going to generate cash value and then that cash value can grow over the next Thirty years\nForty years and then we're going to have a lot of supplemental income available to you\nOr to the to the cash cow open the or in the permanent policy so these are strategies do they work for everybody know do they work for a lot of people yes and they can actually work for you there's a lot of there's a lot of things in life strategies that can be done with life insurance if you're a business owner\nThat's a great way of of of\nSupplementing your uh your retirement income with a life insurance policy\n[noise] um\nCan do executive carve outs where you can bonus people out again you get a key man life insurance policy on one of your executives you're a business owner you got to keep and life insurance policy I'm One of your executives um [noise] you can tell them you know hey here's a in in you know you need to cover them for a million dollars to the business gets to ah\nIf something happens to him to business gets a million dollars to be able to to do an executive search to replace that missing executive that was a key person in the company\nBut you know what let's say that they work for you for Twenty years\nTwenty five years they're going to retire\nThat ... million dollar life insurance policy was business as a needed any more but guess what there's cash and that in that are in that policy\nAnd guess what that you can do now you can bonus that money out to the employee for ah for for twenty twenty five years of loyalty of staying with the company and they can bonus out you can transfer the ownership of that life insurance policy to the uh\nTo to your employee there now the owner they have the cash and the cash count it's their money to do with as they want they can take it out of supplemental income\nA portion of it can be tax free they can borrow against that they can do just about whatever they they can do whatever they want with that cash they can close out the policy and get a lump sum check that's what they want to do\nWhat a great way so life insurance as a vehicle for ah for business owners to to retain key employees to protect a to protect your life or to protect your ah to protect your loved ones in case or in case something tragic happens to you and then uh and then you know\nOn June case or in case something tragic happens to you and then uh and then you know there's even the ... there's\nLike I said there's a lot of new things with life insurance policies now now you can even have life insurance protect you in the form of long term as a as a long term care policy so it's a writer you still have the death benefit but you can uh you can you can access that death benefit while you're alive\nAnd if you need it because you had a a stroke and now you're in a nursing home because you can't bathe yourself you can eat\nYou have to have somebody feed you you have to have somebody help you get dressed\nAnd how you have to be an alert and they're in a nursing home or yes what now you can tap into the death benefit of that life insurance policy and you can pay your nursing home\nBills um while you're in the nursing home and you're on a claim and what a great way\nSo you you you have the death benefit if you die that protect your family when when if if something tragic happens to you and if something even more tragic happens to you which is you you don't die you stay alive\nAnd now you're and now you're trying to figure out well how's how's the family going to pay for all of this I'm not working I don't have any mean any income coming in and and now I have to have a ... now I'm In a nursing home and and it's talking about ten thousand dollars a month well guess what\nWith the with a with a life insurance policy with a long term care writer you get to tap in and you can pull that ten thousand dollars a month out of your ah out of your death benefit while you're still alive to pay the nursing home bill and a and not be a an emotional and a financial drain on the family\nUm and get things taken care of that way\n[noise] so there's a lot of new things with life insurance um you know\nIf you need to give me call nine to ... to to to talk to to to talk or to to to eight to five five you have any questions want to know what you should do\n'em\nAnything along those lines give me a call I'm here I'm available love to hear from you\n\nKnow and then uh don't forget that when you're when you're talking about life insurance always had your children to the policy it's a it's a very inexpensive rider it doesn't cost a lot\nTo maybe five or ten dollars a month she can get ten thousand dollars of coverage on your children for five bucks a month he can get a twenty thousand dollars of coverage for ten dollars a month and that's whether you have one child or twenty children\nYou can cover I'm all for that one five or ten dollars a month it's a great way to get a to have your children have or have life insurance and get started\nMost companies will let you convert that ah that child at that uh ten or twenty thousand dollars\nA they'll let you convert that to a permanent policy when they when they turn twenty five you can converted as early as Eighteen um but some most most parents like to have their their their child on the policy until they turn twenty five and they're forced to convert it out\nUm [noise] so\nYou know bear in mind it's a great it's an inexpensive way if your children develop meant a health condition um while they're young and maybe they don't get or the ability to be to have a life insurance once you have this policy it can convert\nAnd uh and those are\nThose medical conditions that your child might develop as they're growing up I don't necessarily come in as a factor because that conversion ah eliminates the or the need for any type of medical underwriting\nSo again having your children to your life insurance is a is a great way of uh of giving them a head start on a policy um and ah and also avoid some possible medical underwriting a down the road\nFor your children\nAgain uh this is Dan ... with the insurance our a little bit about me\n[noise] I work for a I work for an independent insurance agency here in town called Thomas and associates\nA Thomas and associates has been around for a for for forty eight years or was founded in Nineteen Seventy it's been a it's been helping people like you to listeners of this program the entire time small business owners self employed individuals and people who work for other people\nWould like to help ah we like to business owners with um\n[noise] oh excuse me [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] so I was saying we liked where we like to work with business owners and help them get a help them get employer or employer plans in place help employers are retained\nKey employees higher higher higher quack higher caliber employees\nWe help individuals with their life insurance they're dental and vision their health insurance um we help or we help you find a plan that out of portable rate that has the right than a network of doctors\nWow that was a quick segment but uh we'll see on the flip ... flip side this next profit center break\n[noise]\n\n\nIf you want to explore it um you find you find a a local agent that you feel you can trust that that's going to give you some straight straight answers and and you have a one on one\nWhere you can disclose more more personal information to them so that that so that you can get a there the the answer that's best for you but ... but in general broad based for retired veterans that are that are using\nThe VA or might be on track here for life um non\nRegard show that's different than the trucker guys right\nUm but but it it kind of all applies okay you can you can look at a if you're using the VA for for most of your healthcare um and and maybe even for some prescription drug coverage um you you might want to look at\nUm depending on your income level you can always get a supplement\nThat's that's that's one option the other option would be to go with a a with a Medicare Advantage plan\nUm if you don't need the Medicare Advantage plan for its prescriptive port bundled prescription drug coverage um you look for one that doesn't have prescription drug coverage bundled into it especially if you're getting all of your medications through the VA so\nThat's a that's a that's a that's a way of getting in in that way if the VA is is is a little slow on the appointment process you have the ability to go see a doctor outside of the VA I'm In a slightly quicker fashion\nWell it on that point interestingly enough the VA locally I think is very responsive they even there's been a couple of years but they even I called on a friday night I had some minor painted my neck and [noise] and not talk to the nursing by golly they before I could call my doctor on Monday VA called me\nAnd said can you come in and I went in ... can you do X rays yeah and I write them so I'm going to say the local VA is different I don't know about the national average whatever it is but the local VA services I think are pretty good\nYeah and and you know I I've I've heard that from a lot of veterans hearing the Jacksonville area um yeah and interestingly enough I I I learned that the uh than a lot of these local ... they're they're um\nThey're they're kind of like franchises so so the VA here in Jacksonville isn't necessarily the same VA that you have up in Atlanta or\nSomewhere else they're they're kinda like little franchises or the VA of and and so they they they are they all have slightly different processes on how they're running managed\nSo I think it's a you know so I think what what would that it at that I found that to be to be a pretty interesting\nThing that that that that some of these the or the VA clinics and stuff they're not so much that that that they they are BA but they're but they're but they're like a third party management or franchisee as maybe a a a a better a better way is arriving in\nLocal management from area to area is right or a anyway this one was uh I thought they were pretty responsive and of course there's a lot of veterans in this area I Would think [noise] um\nThere are there are and you know you know Richard like I said I'm\nNot the best thing to do is is if you're trying to contemplate what what you do you do maybe as a as a as a as a supplement to the VA 'em again you you you have the ability to do an advantage plan and then you have the ability to to to go out again depending on income\nTo to see if there's a supplement to the ... as an affordable option for you as well\nYeah but I was I I did actually isn't that great advantage in the beginning and watched it and that's my doctors at I used to regular Medicare but not the\nNot the advantage shut though that's weird [laughter] but so I got off of it so I'm I'm pretty happy with just trade Medicare and I go to the aid for a couple of things in general and Medicare guy and I'm just wondering what you might have to say about all that\n[noise] you know like I said it it everybody's everybody's different so yeah so everybody's situation is different that's the one thing about Medicare it's it's a it's a it's a very much a um [noise] a\nSpecific to the individual so so ... you know your needs different from my needs different from from from John does need of Jane stone age I'm ... just everybody's everybody's different so the so the solution for you is different from the solution of everybody else around you\nAnd probably a good idea just keep looking and they were very good listen\nThanks so much for for a branch taking a shot at my question and thanks for your doing to help the rest\nOf the time you're very welcome sitting there thanks for calling in and go to class out of this I think from either side\nAnd I hear some music in the background there so I think that means we're coming up to another profit center break so keep listening Jacksonville and keep calling and we'll talk to you on the flip side
