Republican club I wanted to add a few things that I encountered a very important okay one I mean I heard on this radio station today that they project fifty or fifty five percent turnout elections the ... state okay\nFaith higher then yeah yeah I was fire than what we have another elections but yeah you're right it's just got\nOut of that mix in the world for the Archie bunkers out there\nJust putting a signing your ground means you've got to get out and vote yes and because it's like somebody tells it all on TALK radio means nothing the same thing with the science and what we're encountering as people coming over to the Republican headquarters\nAsking for ... for science Roger which is an old English term we're seeing all K and\nAnd the thing is they may be asking for a sign on somebody for example let's say you're in\nA congressional district you were asking for a sign for somebody who's not running in your district or commissioner district so I wouldn't be safe to show that when you get your sample ballot from the supervisor of elections has\nDown all the positions that are available to vote on is that correct yes yes it does\nSo therefore when you get to sample ballot way in advance of the election you don't want to know who's running for office so people are coming into our office not knowing what I mean not knowing who they're commissioner is there one commissioner race in Saint saint Charles county there not knowing who's running\nFor for Congress whatever and a lot of confusion going on so\nThey're always sort of thing is I'm referring back to when Al Gore last presidential election and there were certain elements in South Florida who was saying well I thought I was voting for Pat Buchanan the remember that [laughter] fortunately\nI didn't live in Florida at that time but I remember living in another state and laughing hysterically about everything they were in Florida I think\nAbout it but the thing about it was to do with each hanging chads yeah I Know and yeah so brain good that\nThey said well I actually I thought I was voting for Buchanan sort of people have grown at a sample ballot that'll tell them everything\nWell and that was true that's true and and if you if you need a sample ballot lived here and do our county ... and you you can't find one or you didn't get one in the mail you can do to do all the elections dot com and right now the front page it says you can click right\nOn sample ballot put in your address it it'll Chelsea but that's always needed\n... exactly I Marty thank you for the call we were taking a break away and we will be back with you right after the break with your question thanks for holding a everybody stay tune because we are going to have a they have more issues more questions coming up\nI think comedy county wise I Believe we have sixty four of the sixty seven counties thinks that they use the same technology that do vote counted us now don't ask me to uh to tell you which three count ... there\nWere three small ones yeah set ... didn't you didn't have the funds or whatever to a budgeted to to put in that kind of technology but um yeah for the most part of Florida does run with this new electronic system\nAny sharp I tell you when you got to you you you\nYou got to really really\nHard to get back wonderful part about the system we're using now is that there is a tabulation machines\nAnd the um the memory stick that's in that relation machine everything is transmitted to Moscow but there's you know I'm not and [noise] and we always have that paper ... right right\nAh no matter what happens we still got the paper if there's some kind of stir up and poked\nFeed them through their vaccine and uh the tally should come up with the same every time\nThe exactly exactly and\nBalance system I crossed the fifty states and all the confusion for state they were one of the top states with respect to the integrity of our trips them\nYes we are yes we are they going\nIn and cook closure to knock it off the air I Walk her last week I watch more technology that was ... where you can just work for a vote a word that it is I\nI don't have a clue I I don't know I I Know we're not we're not we're not doing that here um I don't know if they're looking at a\nProblem with that so yeah about hacking in Russia and all they really want to have anything on line I stick with what we got\nA wonderful system was at that paper backup if you went to a smartphone technology um there's absolutely nothing has devoted and are and how you voted to that paper I I uh I've enjoyed this\nI'm a big advocate of a national election everybody needs to be on the same page I understand why they're making such a great to build\nA identity uh uh as far as the ... the identity of every ... seem like they're trying to shy away from them a lot of space for some integrity ...\nHey in some states um they don't shy away from it but it's just it's literally against the law in some states\nTo ask anybody for the id ah I I actually\nLived in California I was a poll worker in California and if I asked someone for their id\nEven though they could not pronounce their own name when they presented themselves that the voting booth and had a list not only of the people that were developed for but on the top of that list it listed what their own name was supposed to be if I asked them for id they would arrest\nMe a rescue yes well again and one of those areas\nA lot of people they didn't use regular lab we use\nIt was I had went Orientals and they had poll watchers there and
