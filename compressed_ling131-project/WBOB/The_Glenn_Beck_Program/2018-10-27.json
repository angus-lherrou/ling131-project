two more days in our fiscal year as financial issues is over\nSo that's where we're going\nOur year will be over ten days hard to believe well hopefully\nWe finished the year strong will leave that to the lord and I know that he has no just so many of you are so many powerful ways we have been blessed in such a big way we are so grateful I Do know this and I don't want to say\nI'm looking at is what it is and I'm going to be truthful about it we are obvious this year again going to finish in a block\nWe never had a year in the raid to the house and then nine wise close must admit I panic a little bit to death and and I remember it well and then I was very um\nWell I Wish I were painted from my lack of faith because who came out just fine\nAnd uh this year is not going to be any different but um God continues to know each so any of you to give and you know I'm I've said this before but I'm so humbled\nWhen you all get to this ministry not mainly because I Can't believe I I Believe with all my heart that if you give to this ministry you're doing it because you believe in what God has done you believe or God is due\nIn one of these days you're going to get more powerful feel for exactly what he's done and what do you do is we we get that out to you and him better and bigger detail\nBut it is amazing that we're doing here in the ministry and um but more importantly I'm humble because he's a nudge you God as you know just you\nTo be is it certainly\nTo keep us on the air and to keep this ministry growing so we only ways you know so many opportunities\nHe is\nSeeing that he raises up the funds\nTo help us with all that as well to help us get to that place where he obviously what do you like us to get too so it's ... it's very exciting and we will be in that block this year of course we want to finish strong\nSo we've got ten days eleven days to finish a strong hope we do\nBut um I you know I\nKnow that I could get on the air saying we're going to go off the air and we're about out of money we're going to be in you know a trouble all those things and you want\nOut of money and we're going to be and you know a trouble and all those things and you want to keep us on the air I could say all those things but that would not be true we're going to be fine\nYou're stuck with me for another year at least I'm and we'll ... we'll see but um we've got a lot of a big things coming up this year particularly as we prepare\nTo build out a new studio and of course the expense with that is far more than um I I if I shutter to even think about so we're we're doing that in face\nKnowing their God that God has raised up this opportunity I Believe this is of God to do it and I think he's going to take care of us so um we're not getting ahead of them are going to raise a we're going to wait and so we have all the money if we have to stop in the middle we will do that\n... okay yeah I mean it's I mean there's a growing oh yeah\nYeah yeah I Would keep it I don't know how you know if you want to keep it that's fine I mean your other option of course would be too if you move it then you've got a um diversify it when do you think you're going to be calling on the money using it\nI I've been using it\nOh okay well then yeah I Would definitely keep it where it is\nOkay right up much ratio really pretty gutless you\nThank you Tom uh let me go to a let me\nYou know what let me just answer a couple of questions on YouTube that we're right back to the phones phones are aid for for seven or seven fifty five thirty three\nI'm\nCraig thank you drags just make it a comment on that particular stock or it is a great dogs ... very well um\nAnd and ah today you know maybe a good day to start you know to add to it a little bit but anyway great great company [noise] um let's see Tony asking me or if I said did you say\nThe forty four a was a foundational stock no I did not say that I say I was we were talking about or another stock there was foundation or wasn't he forty four though\nI'm don't remember what it was but it wasn't he forty four I'm so\nA ... oh I I Know what it was yeah no it wasn't it was in a wasn't even a a EnergyStar now we're talking about I remember yeah we talked about the same color or that stock but that's not the one that was the foundation of stock\nOr Dan is saying uh our preferred preferred valued\nWent inherited at the market or the ... you know\nA preferred words are always\nPart value that never changes now\nThe ... the value of the price can go down or up does the where it is right now if it's cold it's always going to get called at par value\nIf you inherited it and when you when Harry did it it was Seventeen dollars a share and the poor values twenty five then and you sell it\nThen you still have you know a stepped up bases so your costs space is going to be whatever the person you are an area that from bought it\nSo from a cost basis standpoint that's how you would figure so if they bought it at twenty five and a Seventeen when you inherited it or not when you inherited boat or a ... on the date of death of the person near a narrative from\nThen yes that would Seventeen dollars would be you were costs basis so if it's now at twenty and you sell it you would have capital gains tax\nOf that the three dollars per share so uh but when it gets called going to get called at twenty five I\nSomeone's asking me Dan I'm Richards asking me Dan I have an investment in income stocks I have a nice ah average yield\nUh butter small loss made me from to stocks I'm concerned about one of those stocks does it have a longtime term upside well\nIf you're concerned about it I Would sell it I'm not concerned but if you're concerned about it I Would sell it I it's an income stock if you have an income stock you're not supposed to be concerned about any income stocks you only concerned about the income that you're receiving\nAnd as long as you're getting income from it every thing on my list has been a long term upside as far as Oxford so I you know every thing on my list long term as an upside to it\nUm if it does and I'm probably going to put it on my cell list but um I Would not be concerned about that if you are truly an income investor if you are concerned about gross\nAnd your income investor then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to\nYou're then you're really not an income investor and probably shouldn't be an income investor probably ought to be thinking about some different kind of growth stocks so I don't know if that helps you are not Richard maybe it does [noise]\nUh let me go to sue sue is calling us from Texas to\nThe point and thank you for taking my call sure I I agree with you about it lately I disappointed and I'm going to face but I mean we have to remember that we pray for somebody that they were placing her that with any of the efforts also\nDue to a point in much better on the planet much better points that I made about any of that so yes a good point I appreciate your bringing it up because we she was such a strong person in that very important position\nWe need to pray that God raises up another person as strong as for sure good points thank you for sharing that\nAnd then you know it's getting so far for next appointment\nYes yeah yeah exactly 'cause I don't think she's going anywhere she's going to be in the\nIn the life for a while I Believe\nI I think it brings up a great many people they bring our country that are that we are saying\nNo doubt about it I'm with you on that suit God prescribing yep [laughter] I think you can I let\nMy husband and I are old self employed I'm an attorney think the real estate broker the company went one time we currently have three teenagers at home not wanting to say it on a pool or near Dallas that's the other two are in high school\nI mean they're not even paying for their college the system with everything they need to pay for college they get bored and they don't waste it so that that will sell for all of our other children as well right um but we had lost pretty happy over the last\nDecade on all things a lot of our our painting poor thing but we're we are right now we have to apartment building\nKept walkway awhile to hundred thousand dollars of equity I'm a little bit ... hundred thousand and it's a little bit more perhaps we're looking at selling those um\nAnd so and then we have about a hundred and thirty thousand dollar mortgage on our house we have no other that but we do not have the same thing go like why\nDidn't you know what we think is do we have plenty out of the apartment building and thirty one that into something out\nShould we pay our house and then start\nBuilding a bad fit me open Iraq's IRA you know what is a plan for it we can continue for war or a great long time but we are self employed and we all know often it but we want it to\nThat right so if you are getting your your obviously getting positive cash flow out of those apartment\nWe are but they are located in another state and about an hour one way drive so that was one of our thought what do we we\nAre a great state of high income taxes and high taxes will stay at that so now they are they are at the end up so that was one of his knee why we were thinking of selling them and then re purchasing closer to at least\nYou know so um I think that's a fine idea if you're okay having real estate [noise]\nUh I don't think you're going to do better from an income perspective and anything you do a\nBetter that's going to be better than the than the real estate\nAnd I think the idea of tend to you know I mean obviously I Would find it gets give some property lined up because you obviously understand the time limit there you have to get that reinvest it but I think that's a that's a great idea\nI I think that you know whether I don't know how much equity a you say you've got about two hundred thousand dollars in equity and you've got two hundred thousand or two thirty on your on your mortgage um I I mean from my perspective based on what you've said I probably would would I'm looking at\nUsing the equity to take care of your income needs for your retirement not necessarily to pay off the income or the mortgage now at some point in time when you do retire if you don't work if you stop working then there's always the question of it is you were\nYou know mortgage going to become burdensome uh to to pay for that every month and now the the positive cash flow that you have in this new real estate investment\nIs um you know going mostly to pay that mortgage since you don't have the income anymore and that's where you have to think about I Would probably take the approach that I Would\nI'm\nNot still still leave things the way they are if you work in another five years I Would wait you know that's going to you may be getting to the place in the mortgage where a lot more of your principal and maybe have opportunity with some of the new guys for [noise] slowly you generate to\nPay towards other principal\nAnd relieve some of the time you have left to pay that and I would rather see you do that and I think that makes much more sense so I Would do the ten cent or you want to change I Would get that done I think that makes good sense I Would do it sooner rather than later because I'm concerned about the ... the um\nYou know the the sale of the property you know I I don't know where it is but you do and it might be in a great area and you're not concerned about that but uh I Would do it sooner rather than later um get that sale and start reinvest\nA a man Dr one belt is one of the greatest speakers you'll ever here on how do we
