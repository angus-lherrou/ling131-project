be a little more political than most are I'm not in the sense of direct politics but the subject has political\nDirect political ramifications I have a\nHave a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose and by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty or to be taken care of\n\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nNot be taken care of and have to take care of themselves now obviously up to the extreme that you can you can find a doctor you can't find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about\nAll you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\nBut\nThat is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assumed that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it

November let's go to let us go all the tax cuts work dot com\nAnd I'm Dennis Prager this is the ultimate issues or were the third of our own Tuesday's so my question is do people prefer liberty or there'd be taken care of\n\nEverything in life is a value is is one of the revelations of the second half of my life I did not know this is a kid so many things that I just assumed were are given like love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage that assumes that love and marriage\nAre still somewhat or automatic you ... you were you horse carriage are pretty much on America ... without the carriage nobody goes in the courage and the character up the horse it doesn't move so they go together and so do love and marriage but it's not true\nMarriages choice marriages valley we even a value\nAnd we have not taught these values and the and liberty is a value this is the one that shocked me this I I I figured out the one on marriage but this one really surprise me\nLiberty is not a year earning liberty is a value\nThat's correct that is correct\nOf you may know the greatest a project of my life I've been engaged in now it's thirty year project in the first of all you will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible\nHe will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible the first one of them coming out with this book of exodus\nAnd it's fascinating how the Israel lights are liberated from Egypt and then constantly complain oh bring us back to Egypt at least we ate better there or imagined that the better there\nWas a slave mentality the slave mentality is hey\nI got taken care of I got three square meals I they they took care of me medically I had no liberty but I was taken care of that is what the slave mentality is now that's not all slaves were treated decently to say the least it's obvious but if you were decently treated\nYou weren't murdered you weren't weren't whipped if you did you work\nYou got fed lifers route and I didn't have to worry about any female one does she live on your part was necessary that's that's not all that bad for the human the human human nature\nIs not geared toward yearning for freedom believe it or not it's not\nYou may think it is but it isn't\nThat's why that book is so powerful may be not such a great idea to leave slavery and it's you know there are all forms of slavery addiction as a form of slavery and we've there I'm not being poetic justice your ear and slave to whatever it is you're addicted to\n\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans and before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of and the answer is almost always yes and the more that you aren't given the more or less freedom you really want\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust the blurb assume our what like coal American trinity run a book on the American ... still the best hope\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us take care of people take care of my if you take care of me\nTake care of my children\n\nWhy people who home school their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not the dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\n\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say may offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf\nOf being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nAh let's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first pillow or who doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania Hi\nI I think they want to be on good terms\nI

culture\nThe punishment is worth anything your parents are dead so it becomes a question [noise] two things one is we want to be taking a charm\nAnd the second thing is\nWhat terms we demand determined by our culture as\nWell right I don't know where we differ but uh I really appreciate your call thank you I think the gangs is a\nGood example you're taking care of in the game [noise]\nI
