I'm Carrying Morton chairman of the Republican Party here in our county and also with me today is John crafts\nAnd I am sitting here trying to multitask a computer and\nAnd bribe emailed us and develop mailing lists and so if they if you have something to throw other than that a soft drink [laughter]\nDon't throw any I sent me please okay\nWe are as it is it is indeed election season we are trying to to to do twenty things at the same time so sorry about that but where we're glad to to have this hour with everybody\nUm we've got a lot of things that we wanted to talk about but I I also wanted to let you know that obviously you can call in with any questions or comments or that you have nine zero for to to to talk that's nine zero for eight to five five and a a give us a call um\nThe first thing we are going to have a special gas at a that two Fifteen we've got um a Mr tomatoes cement as calling in uh he's putting on a an event he does a really really really good job at doing candidate forums didn't does that tact\nKiller job during the um the primaries\nAnd uh um it it he's he's got another one lined up that we're going to be talking about the coming up next week so he's going to be joining us on the radio or in just a few minutes after the next after the break\nBut uh in the meantime ... um first thing I wanted to let people know about is the huge event that we have going on\nHere in Jacksonville October Eighteenth that his Thursday October Eighteenth and we're going to be at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial arena in the evening for a huge banquet\nThese special guest coming in is judge Janine and judge Janine if you have not I I I I Would assume most of the people listening in have have seen judge Janine on Fox News she's got her Saturday evening I'm a show\nShe also has been feeling in a lot for I'm Sean Hannity which is actually why we have her on Thursday October Eighteenth\nOriginally we were we were going to set things up for friday and then she suddenly had to fill in for sun that night so we got her Thursday October Eighteenth and it's going to be a really great evening I'm up there there are receptions there's a full banquet um she's going to be speaker\nUh it along with I might add some of the the big statewide candidates that will be in town as well when we know for sure that Ron dissent is running for governor will be here that night and we'll be speaking on stage with judge Janine so that'll be great um and\nAnd we'll be speaking on stage with judge Janine so that'll be great uh and they got good chemistry 'cause they've worked together before actually so that that's going to be it's going to be good shout\nCouldn't ... couldn't help but reflect on or something you said just a little while ago about to someone you knew being a very Curt bought a to point um and then you brought a judge to name yeah and and I thought man these two characters that you were talking about couldn't even hold again\nThat is true that is true she's she's a spit fire I Love I Love it absolutely\nOh you did a great job and I mean you had you had all the major um races on the ballot or and and most of the candidates for each race did show up and I I Believe that you know he ... betting in of itself is quite a seat\nBut then you get three hundred voters in there who who who are going to listen to what people have to say so they can make up their minds and in in in ... in in foreign ballad that's incredible that's huge\n[laughter] yeah well that's really the you know that's really our focus of its was the focus has been um to just create awareness\nAnd and get you know folks who want to be involved a and even those who maybe have not been involved in the past or inform so that they can make an informed decision when they're going to the ballot I think I think there's been a little bit of\nA obviously we have some polar candidates right now that we're on one extreme or the other\nBut I I think that uh we need to get the word out as to what the values are of these specific candidates and you know who who are referring to [noise] um so that the the folks who are going to the ballot are informant understand the values of\nThe people that they're voting for and and uh I think if people come to know candidates individually as opposed to the rhetoric that goes on about party a I think that that's a good opportunity to get folks to vote and be energized to vote and to vote appropriately\nI think you're absolutely right and and you have\nA a contact list and you have a network of people with your own and you know you you own your own law firm and and you have\nYou have your OWN Network of of attorneys but but you know just people in general uh that that you've interacted with\n'em and and you were able to really pull a lot of people who would not have necessarily ever come to something that was put on by the Republican Party or by the Democrat Party you are able to just draw people in who really wanted to find out what was going on and be educated and it was amazing you did such a great job\nAnd I'm I I think that's exactly what's going to happen on October night as well\nThat's what we're projects and I think it's over to Iraq is going to prove to be even a a greater success on the one that we had in July I think it's\nYou know July was one that was you know it it proved to be a number one that people want to be a part of it that they want to hear a front of the candidates they want to be involved\nAnd it was really the the kind of a stepping stone to really send us to the next level with the next event so we we work hard on that we got a little bit of coverage on it but it was a knock obviously to to fill the room and this time around we're really getting a lot of exposure and I and I really think it's going to be a full house which is great\nBecause I think you know again it's kind of goes to\nBeing able to to create that understanding of who these folks are the folks meaning the candidates\nAnd and for the constituents to understand these folks and meet them uh you know and and and and be informed and that's really you know so I think again and ... and and really with all the things that go on and and the uh in the arena now with the elections\nIt's ah it's creating an environment for people to become more energized to go out and vote and I think that's that's helpful for us as far as putting his offense to go\nAbsolutely absolutely totally agree with you totally agree so okay so October ninth is a what what day of the weakest Tuesday to do that's coming up Tuesday October nine\nSure is coming\nTo me it just speaks up on ya [laughter]\nAnd and so a ... where is it and when and how do people get there and what do they have to do\nOkay so it's actually being held at a Havana ... a cooler we ran around with ... boulevard that's a twenty five Seventy Atlantic boulevard it's right across from the function Catholic school in church and bishop county\nI'm In ... in the St Nicholas area hosted downtown and we're starting at five thirty to do the meet and greet in registration a Kennedy formal start properly at six and then after the forum or we're going to have a a a reception where folks to interact and mingle with the candidates\n[noise] oh that's nice that's nice of people not only get to hear the candidates go back and forth with each other but you're going to be able to to to that they're going to hang around you can talk with them ask your own questions get to know them you know and and that make a decision\nAnd also senator Aaron Bean has been gracious enough to ah to sponsor and provide a the phones for uh for the workers are going to have at the end of the event oh wow so special thanks\nFor uh for the orchards that we're going to have at the end of the event oh wow so special thanks to a center being in a forest\nHair and being a senator and being he's a great guy really really\nIs he really is it really

for for the house or in the jak ready to Jacksonville area is going to be district eleven twelve Fifteen and sixteen hundred and a contested race will all be they're both sides wow a and then we'll

there'll be there there'll be there as well so it's going to be and they're going to present and of course we have other candidates for the upcoming elections for the um\nFor the unitary government that will be president as well but that's for next year's election so they won't present we'll have another event for them to call\nBut you know I think it's going to be trying to be a full house\nAbsolutely fantastic so so you've got 'em or if you've got the U.S house a representative coming in then you've got Aaron Benin in his his his opponent belly by third and then in district eleven at scored bird versus\nNecessarily Rob ... correct you're not quite sure how to say that I ... yeah I Know quite Yarborough and that\nTimothy Yost is a district twelve correct district Fifteen is Wyman dug in and Tracy Paulson yes and then district sixteen is Jason Fisher and can or can't ask\nSo that is sad that that's gonna that's gonna be a good good event they they let them let them talk and in a kind of you are you going to be asking questions or is it going to be more of a format ... are they going to be able to go back and forth with each other how's that going to work\nWell what we are going to do is we're going to ask questions so\nWhy movie them an opportunity to do in a shorter adoption it's obviously it's going to be a total of eleven folk so [noise]\nUm because we have eleven uh we got to kind of keep it a little ... concise but we'll have an opportunity to make a quick introduction will ask them a couple of questions or we're going to ask some pointed questions though they're not going to be these easy softball questions were announced with some real good questions that are going to be directly\nA with what the issues are in in in our country really I mean obviously our communities or you know obviously affected by that but what are what are the important issues that are facing us right now going forward and I heard you\nEarlier or talking about what we're facing as far as these concepts of uh of communism and are in these types of issues and obviously it's kind of the uh the one thing that we want to try to\nTalk about it and see you know warrior differences are on some of those on on those issues gun control issues and and and things like that are important\nAt all an excellent yeah I I yeah if when there are differences between candidates people must be aware so they can choose wisely so absolutely you know what I Am so happy that you were able to call in with us today so you're in van is coming up on Tuesday October nine

can just common is that right\nThat's right it's open to the public and I'm hoping that uh all your listeners are not a ton of them\nAre [laughter] yeah well I don't think that you like that sucks if you want to come out and you wouldn't not only hear these candidates but if you've got a candidate that they you know that you are really rooting for ... and I think a lot of our listeners do get out and support your candidate\nOr that also makes a huge difference so um\nYeah I mean if you're listening to this radio show and you live in Jacksonville or the surrounding area or you work in Jacksonville in may cross the line to go home get over next Tuesday to Havana jacks and uh and and sitting on this for 'em because they do a great great job and there is a there is an open bar over
