here [noise] and then the insurance [noise]\nHey good afternoon Jacksonville this is Dan ... with the insurance our I'm here to answer all of your health insurance questions home property property and casually claims whenever a whatever issues or questions you may have\nFeel free to to give me a call it to to to talk and I'll be happy to answer your questions\nUm there's a lot going on in the uh in the insurance industry right now especially now with the open enrollment um\nMedicare open enrollment started officially yesterday October fifteenth or individual health insurance or for Obamacare a begins a November first to ah to get your plans updated for the two thousand Nineteen year\nAnd uh there's there's just a lot that happens or at this time of year it gets busy it gets confusing and uh and you get buried under a mountain of ah of information from people advertising and sending you are sending material over the mail through the mail so uh\n[noise] so it's I Know it's easy to get confused so give me a call when ah when you have a question you know when it comes to Medicare and you're turning sixty five or you're you're ... you're going to be turning sixty five in the next year or so\nOr you got to be careful because it's easy to make mistakes that ended up costing you money ah basically forever for the rest of your life which can be a very very long time now\nI'm Medicare is easy um it it's easy to navigate when you have somebody that can help you uh\nHelp you get through the uh through some of the little bumps on the little speed bumps along the way and then it's a it's it's really very smooth sailing and once you're on it you were on it\nUm [noise]\n[noise] so with Medicare you you basically you have three options when you're turning sixty five he got option one it's a it's original Medicare that's where the government is going to pay eighty percent of the bills you you're going to be on the hook for twenty percent and you buy a prescription drug plan\nPretty simple except that you're on the hook for twenty percent of your medical expenses if it's a thousand dollar bill or that's what what two hundred bucks but if it's a hundred thousand dollar bill and you're having to reach into your pocket for twenty thousand bucks that's a lot it's a lot no matter who you are\nI'm option to staying on original Medicare government still going to pay the eighty percent but now what you're going to do is you're going to buy a supplement plan or I met a gap plan from an insurance company they're going to cover that twenty percent\nAnd you're out of pocket is zero he'd been by a small prescription drug plan for another twenty five thirty maybe thirty five bucks a month to cover your prescription drugs that's the way to go if you can afford roughly about a two hundred dollar a month payment for the for the uh for the Medicare plan\nOption three that covers most of retirees and that's your Medicare Advantage plan you leave an original Medicare the government's not going to pay eighty percent instead what they're going to do they're going to send your part B premium along with some additional money to the insurance company\nUm\nYou're going to be able to enroll into a into a ... into a Medicare Advantage plan typically there is zero premium will have a monthly premium with um some of them do most of them do not\nIm I'll have a monthly premium with um some of 'em do most of them do not and uh and then you're going to have some co pays when you go to the doctor if you have hospitalization you're going to have some co pays for one to four days one to five days maybe one to seven days\nAnd you're going to have a stopgap they include a prescription drug plan and ah and that's it there think of your traditional group health insurance plan that's how a Medicare Advantage plan is structured to do not paying anything for it on a monthly basis\n[noise] so that's kind of you rode the Medicare and it's got to have to figure out it's a it's easy to get lost it's easy to get confused and\nUh [noise] [noise] [noise] excuse me\nThere's been some roll back in the regulations concerning temporary health plans and uh you can get a temporary health plan a for a year at a time and uh and maybe save some premium dollars that way a there\nAre some pros and cons on temporary plans we will go over there was a little bit later but uh but they are there are again feel free to give ... give me a call if you have any questions to to to talk that's two two to eight to five five\n[noise] um [noise]\n[noise] so we have a ... let me tell you what let's go ahead and go into a temporary plant some pros and cons\nAnd there's a there's a lot of good stuff about them and then there's a little like I said there's a little bit negative to him so I mean get mine notes here\nSo you know what is a temporary plan has has it's has it's defined temporary\nIt's not meant to be long term it's not really meant to be the year over year it's just meant to to cover a gap\nUm however because of the Affordable CARE Act and what it did to the insurance pricing and uh and the premiums temporary plans for the for the healthy have become a very a very good option\nUh they they of course they keep the premiums down lower um\nBut there are some but they but they don't they don't necessarily cover preexisting so if you're like a type two diabetic or you had a heart attack\nAnd were or survived cancer um you know the insurance company has a right to ask you the or some some health some qualifying health questions they're allowed to to to pull your medical history and then there are allowed to say hey yes or no we want to insure you or we don't want to insure you\nSo that there's there's a there's a big con a big negative for you that\nAh that an insurance company can refused to ah to insure you on a temporary health plan dependent upon your health condition but again if you're healthy you can qualify for some very very low a low premium amounts\nUm [noise] so [noise] [noise] but what else can they do well do they do they cover to\nDo they cover hospitalization yes a temporary plan covers hospitalization um doesn't cover doctor visits well it can some of 'em do cap co pays usually unlimited copay amount usually you get to go maybe to to\nTo doctor visits a quarter or a or poor for doctor visits over a six month period um and you get a and you get a copay when you go to your primary care where a specialist Dr doesn't matter which one because of course it depends on the plans\nUm well they cover um well it cover a maternity well it will if you're not pregnant when you get on the plan if you get pregnant while you're on the plan yeah you're covered\nUm\nDoes it cover a few a bullet cover a I'm a spouse only if you had this ... only if you take the spouse is this your spouse is added when you're taking out the plan if you get married midway through you don't really necessarily get the option to add a ah a dependent on to the plant you gotta wait they got to get their own\nUm\nThe average short term premium and two thousand fourteen was a hundred and ten dollars for a for an individual\nUm that's gone up a little bit but still be pretty inexpensive I'm most uh most temporary plans have why there's a wide range of deductibles on them or depending on the company can get as low as a five hundred or a thousand dollar deductible\nAnd again depending on the company you can get as high as a twelve thousand five hundred dollar deductible\n\nSo [noise] you do have the ability to uh to to to mitigate the premium because of course the higher the duck double the\nLower your monthly premium is gonna be the insurance company they have a pretty select or or or a pretty wide diverse network\nUm in in ...\nOr a pretty wide diverse network um\nIn in some cases there's a there's a couple of plants here in uh in in northeast Florida and actually for Florida on the temporary that ah that include the Mayo Clinic so if the Mayo clinic's important to you and you don't want to spend\nAn arm and a leg for health insurance getting a qualified health plan that gives you all the ten essential health benefits\nUm you can get a a ... you might get a a a temporary plan you might see if you can qualify for a temporary planned pay less and still have access to the Mayo Clinic\nSo it's a it's a thing to consider it's an option especially if you're retiring early it's a it gives you some uh some options as to what you can do\nYou know when does the coverage start usually within one to fourteen days of when the application is a is submitted\nThat it won't protect while there's no tax penalty anymore for not having a qualified health plan so uh so that's not really an issue on it any more you can buy 'em all year round there's not an any type of open enrollment window for them\nOr period like we're moving into now for qualified health plan um remember it can be declined uh for pre existing conditions depends on the company some will not um but let's be honest most will\nUm pit bull that cover maternity care well it again yes if you're pregnant and you have the baby\nAfter you've gotten the plan you can't be pregnant before you get a before you enroll ended up plan will cover ... doctor visits again yes it will some of them at least I'm\nAnd you'll pay more for those those that's kind of like the little premium benefit um for a temporary plan so it will increase the premiums somewhat um it does cover for hospitalization that will cover for urgent care visits\nUm but again if you have a pre existing um you'll either you want to do things you will either be denied by the insurance company for the insurance company will say hey we're we're right to plan but we're not going to cover that pre existing health condition\n[noise] um\nThere is no government subsidy for them so you are paying the full premium for the temporary plan\nUm can you renewed every year or the answer to that is is yes\nAs long as you haven't suffered some sort of an accident or illness direct\nThroughout the year give me how I'll give you a prime example you're on a temporary health plan you have a ... you have a major heart attack everything he is he going to the hospital they pay the claims\nEverything as well and good could come up to your renewal window while the insurance companies going to send you a letter and they're going to say hey hey John Hi Mr John Doe um\nWe're we're\nWe're exercising are right and a ... you now have a pre existing condition which he didn't have before but you do now we're not going to cover you were not going to we're not going to rent we're not going to allow you to renew the plan\nUm which is going to put you into the basically the Obamacare markets and you're going to have to find qualified health plan that's not going to ask you about preexisting health conditions and yes you'll probably end up paying a higher premium\nFor the plant 'em\nAgain on average um you you are going to save probably I Want to say easily fifty to sixty percent based on a qualified health plan um [noise]\nYou know and and if you can qualify for a subsidy\nSometimes that's the way to go and you know I I I talked to clients all day long many of them say I don't want to pay the I don't want to I don't want to go I don't want to Obamacare I don't want to get a subsidy I don't believe in the plan I don't believe in law and ah so I don't want to I don't want to have it\nI understand it's a it's a philosophy it's an opinion I understand I respect it I'm here's the way I look at it\nWe are all paying out of our taxes for Obamacare to subsidize a segment of the population that makes for a hundred percent or lower of the federal poverty level\nOf to give you an example in two thousand and Nineteen if you're a one person household single no dependents\nI'm One hundred percent of the federal poverty level is twelve thousand one hundred and forty dollars so if you make twelve thousand one hundred and forty dollars\nUp to forty eight thousand five hundred and sixty dollars which is four hundred percent of the federal poverty level he will qualify for some sort of a tax credit or subsidy\nThe larger your family size the more money\nUm the more money you can make the more the higher the maximum amount gets and also the ah the higher the minimum amount cats so if you're a two person households single mom and the kid single dad and a kid a husband and wife\nUm you know your minimum is ah sixteen thousand four hundred and a four hundred and sixty dollars you're max\nSixty five thousand uh\n... hey I fear the music for a break we're going to take a little bit of break we'll come back and uh and we'll we'll keep going over it\n[noise]\n\nThan your subsidies going to be pegged\nTo two hundred dollars technically you'll get a subsidy of two hundred dollars if you're\nGoing to typically get a a subsidy that equals the cost of the second cheapest silver plan\nSo then what happens well you decided I don't want to buy the second cheapest silver plan I Want to go with a bronze level plan well a bronze level plan might only cost a hundred and fifty dollars you're going to get a two hundred dollars subsidy because of the ah the cost of the second cheapest silver plan\nHe got fifty dollars more than you need he get a zero premium you don't make any ah any health insurance payments for the year\nAnd you move on\nIf on the other hand you say well you know what the second ... second cheapest silver plan in my area it doesn't really have the coverage is I Need I Need to go get this this this silver plan or this gold plan\nWell\nIf that plan costs three hundred dollars you're still going to get the two hundred dollars subsidy and then you have to make up a hundred dollars on the ah\nOn the overage and that's where your monthly premium comes from\nNow it the other thing you can do is you can always say you know what I don't care I don't want to go with the uh I don't want to go with the formal CARE Act I just want to reach into my pocket\nAnd just pay the premium and that's what you're going to do the same plan that ah that's that's available typically I Want to say the same plan that's available on the Affordable CARE Act on the federal exchange\nThat's qualified for a subsidy you can usually get a through\nUh the insurer in a direct purchase and that's not necessarily true uh there are some times plans at the insurer cells that doesn't qualify for a subsidy they're only available\nOn what's known as an Hoff exchange or a direct purchased from the health insurer and then they sometimes also have plans that you can only get\nThrough a subsidized 'em through the through through the Affordable CARE Act as a subsidized plan um he cannot get it direct\nUm [noise] so that's something else to kind of consider so you don't like I said regardless ...\nWhere you want to do with your health insurance this year whether you want to consider a temporary plan whether you want to consider a qualified health plan where they decide how I just I just want to go on insured\nUm you know I Would recommend that you reach out and you talk to her to a to a license held a health insurance professional um get some uh get some second opinions have how I'm run your scenario\nAnd give you some uh and give you some options um I like to say you don't try to fix your electricity on your own you don't try to fix your car on your own you know calling in what tradition or you go to in the car mechanic to get your car fixed nowadays\nUm health insurance is the same way can be a very confusing subject you can make mistakes you can get stuck with a bad plan um and that's because the plan isn't the right one for you and that's what makes it a bad plan\nAnd uh you\nKnow so sometimes you just need a a professional to tell you know that's not the right plan for you this one is and then they'll explain why and then you can make in a an informed decision as to what a as to what you want to do\nUm you know and like I said I'm\nSubsidies are determined by your household size and your income levels so depending on how much you or how much you make\nTen and how many people are in your household that determines where you fall on the federal poverty chart again as long as you're making between one hundred percent and four hundred percent um you're kind of in the golden zone 'em and uh\nAnd your plans will only get back and you're and he'll at least get a financial subsidy to help lower the premium um and then if you make below two hundred and fifty percent of the federal poverty level there's a second says\nSubsidy known as ... year reductions\nAh which the insurance companies are mandated to provide\nAnd are those cost sharing reduction subsidies they changed your co pays you're a duck the bulls and your co and you're out of pocket maximum on the health care plans and they lower those dollar amounts to make the plans easier to use an access\nA health care in a in a\nIn an easier and easier method um\n[noise] so that's kind of you know where we're at ... with the with health insurance again you you have a lot of uh you have a lot of options again it can be very confusing it's easy to choose the wrong plan if a if there's any take away on this is don't buy a plan based on price\nUm [noise] so again don't buy a plan on price that's the wrong way to get a plant and I'm like I say find a find a license health health insurance
