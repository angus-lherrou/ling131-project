election and a ... they have a few things want to say you can send it to me and we'll put it on the show\nYeah that'd be fun OK fun that's always great yeah well we've got a lot to talk about today we have a great show for people or one of the things people always are telling me is that I don't promote myself enough so today\nIt's definitely the Anita high will show okay [laughter] as and we're going to be talking about ... executives and how awesome this company is right right so we have a great show\nTo be honest with you before I met you I've never heard of real estate executives isn't that crazy all of it but it's really resonate so now I Know all about it and you know first thing that comes to mind now when I think the real estate\nYes realty executive yes we're definitely becoming a household name here in northeast Florida and uh you know the company's been in business since Nineteen sixty five\nReally are old uh were fifty three years old so we've been around for quite a while and so I'm I'm really proud to be part of realty executives\nI Would imagine you guys cover the full gamut of real estate services but is there a specific specialty wrangle but you guys handle well\nAll about marketing and um you know here at realty executive oceanside we definitely marketer properties and what can you tell us is up and coming and what is really the executives offer the public\nIs one thing that I think it's really important about realty executive is that we've got the most experienced that that agents with the lowest expertise that's why we call them executives and so\nOne thing that we're focusing on in our marketing is our people SOS executives\nBecause a lot of times when you look at the advertising out there for other brands it's all about just a you know a campaign that general\nBut at the end of the day consumers are working with the percentage that help buyers fell off home which is a huge deal and not relationship is critical\nTo one thing that we're working on is I'm a school can see her campaign that helped bring our age instead of for a friend and really let it shine let it marketing is right now but when you look out there at\nThat you know social world and everything that's going on and hitting the earth it it's a very noisy kind of area to what we're focusing on at ... this is the first one that\nThat the agent is who you're going to be working with and kind of bringing that to the forefront and behind that the power of a brand that sit around for more than fifty years without all the resources that are tools that the agent needs to help that at that fire seller\nFight they bring their own expertise on the local area\nOn exactly what works in the area and the best way to get the best price whether you're buying or selling and sale that something that we're working on now is getting a brand new campaign out there that helps bubble that that person that you're going to be working with rather than platitudes than some general branding campaign\nHere so missing 'em to what is our our focus you know uh\nWe have a tagline yeah we have something new this year um that were really pushing which is focused on our people that's right and what can you tell me about her new campaign\nOne thing that you see a lot about their stock tiger face and you know ... it's about ... general things that that that company does across the entire company\nWhat we're working on dealing is it at our campaign slogan is it a lot about us it's about you and not only is ... said that broke breached the agent where the brokerage\nReally is there to support the agent but that is part of the agents that customer today not about the age of it's not about everything that they have to say about that it's about the customer and how they can help them and sell it it's not about it's about you\nCampaign allows us\nTo really stand on the shoulders of what we got it so far but as ... much more personalized fell on you know as somebody in Florida it doesn't really care what our ages and say I alert feeling they want to know exactly who they're going to be working with and the local market so\nA lot of that material for that campaign I'm at work developing really focuses on customizing based on your area and\nWhich really focuses on customizing based on your area and based on the age of themselves to get a lot more personal rather than the state's general campaigns and it talked about the fact that we're focused on our customers we're focused on our executives which are agents\nUm and that is where we feel like that power lies in terms of our friends\nAnd we also we have um well we have a couple of different focuses its letting you view and I'm going to support services to me a little bit about the support services\nWe've got actually award winning services for our executive we looked at me that I'm a company called his death to manage that process of communication sales are executives in our broker it can either reach out to us via chat\nYet email via phone that then that gets kinda that back in the Senate laptop and well we went to that and I said can you give us statistics on our response that versus\nThe competitors ... and they came back and said you guys are two point seven times more response says\nThan awesome additives fat and fit in I mean a lot of these a lot of these ... are managed within minutes people get their answers within minutes and we have actually in Ninety three percent of our chat are answered within a minute\nAnd said that level of service really you know we do that for a job that that are agents provided to their customers and it stopped trickle down effect where again it's not about to sit out here and you were focused and we're going to show that in our service levels\nGrade and one thing too is explain a relationship with the Zillow\nYet so we actually had a really good relationship with fellow lie to customers go there to see what's on the market and we understand that we want to partner with that that had more of a presence on that site settled a couple of things we're doing is first of all we\nAdded our real the executive branding every lifting boats in the U.S and Canada\nAnd sit down and cleared it's our video it's our brand videos information about our company are low though too it's clear on Zillow that that is a real the executive listing\nOn we also are one of the air partner to set joined with allowed to go into Canada and they they've been around in the U.S for a while they just went into Canada last month\nAnd it's so we were one that just that you a real estate companies\nTo go in with them and be on their site from the get go which really is that titan at on the ground floor the ability to be tied into them as consumers\nStart to understand the purpose of them in Canada at the Iraq had been able to see a realty executives with that and understand that you know real ...\nIs everywhere and you can find our let\nThings regardless of where you want to look\nThat's awesome and I believe we can go to our website realty executives dot com and search for property anywhere correct\nWe've got we've got all at the property is available on our website and that that all of them are lifting as well as everybody else to say we've got to comprehend it says on the lifting process and you search by everything you can search for on his fellow are truly at\nOn and so if you go there at the interface as early nights huge picture at the at that video that the map on and you can really dig in that then you can reach your agent right there eight one that um some time to go see that house\nOr you want to talk about selling your home that you can do all of that from our website\nIn which you know agree weren't military town so it's awesome as the fact that we have somebody relocating\nRich and go on to really the executives dot com and search for wherever they're getting transfer to if it's prince were the job if it's through military or just somebody who is a you know just starting to move back home if it's on the west coast\nSo they can go on to release the executive dot com and start looking for um a place to live\nYou're absolutely right they could they can tap their their home for sale on our site in one city and the looking for a home cooked by across the country on the same website\nThat is fantastic that's awesome and what can you tell me about her shield seemed\nTo which the meaning of our ... you know it seems like a I have a shield when I was a continent I I I find the one real estate company that has a shield meant that we wouldn't be\nThat it's something that we we have a ball dark brand but our shield has been around since we started and sell you know it has an over fifty or like I say and we find that there's a lot of brand awareness in the market\nWith chest that shield shaped alone and it's you know with all that and when it's out there it's hard to differentiate yourself\nSo we find you know on our on our science it's really recognize the bowling do stunts that are that she'll cut out and sell\nAs as um customers are driving by it catches your eye and more than just a square science\nDoes sets their way to really identify ourselves and we had just launched a new campaign called what year sign\nThat's great well stay with us Melissa I've got a few more questions for you when we come back\nOn rapid fire with Anita high levels on WB we'll be\n\n\nHas a tough time talking with people mhm I guess you could still be shy but you you have to have the ability to have a conversation with people\nAnd put yourself out there and if you can it can be it could be a problem in real estate 'cause you're always\nPutting yourself out there and uh and stuff some people um you know may seem like they're shy but one on one that they do fantastic hotel it's you know it's just different with everybody in every personality so to say that there's one trait\nWould be difficult um I Know that we have um\nYou know I I I look at Betty Betty and I are are a lot of like in a lot of ways but then there were so different you know and so you know and she's a top producer and the same with Casey and you know it just it just depends we're all different there's clients for everybody so\nYou know that's why we're not all the same exact with you know\nI mean that's one last question a typical a realtor who's been with ... executives or maybe ten years about ... ballpark income range do you expect them to have or is it all over the map\nIt's you know everybody's got their own um goals that they want to reach too so there's agents out there that make a million dollars a year and there's agents out there that make thirty thousand dollars a year now in each individual agent has goals and ambitions that they want\nTo achieve not everybody actually wants to make a million dollars a year it's hard to believe that that's reality you know they don't want to work that hard or or invest in their business so we really you know aspire to help agents we call them executives to to reach the goals they want to we spend a lot of time\nOr providing them their entrepreneurial freedom and are helping them to reach their goal\nOkay [noise] and the cool thing is we've got a also in the house we've got a Casey strengthen her and we have a Betty Layton and uh when I have you share the Mike they're in custody [laughter] you know [laughter]\nBut Casey we could tell us what is it like to work with a real idiot executives and want to you know what some of the things that you are appreciate\nYou know I Love working ... executives it's definitely um [noise]\nBefore I went with wrote the executive I interviewed with a lot of different brokerage company\nAnd it just seemed like the perfect fit everybody here when I sat down for us to talk with a ... you know it was great everything was wonderful like ships that are a lot of like we're both\nPretty direct a lot of different ways but also a nurturing and a lot of lace kill and so that was one of the things that really piqued my interest and\nWhen I signed on I was actually working full time and but something that she was willing to accommodate last I've gone yeah fulltime now real estate front property management but\nEverybody works at a team everybody treats it sounded like family if somebody looks like they're not feeling well companies quickly rushing to go get something for somebody\nYou know everybody just seem to really work together as far as even open houses in shelling if somebody can't make it somewhere or have an emergency come up somebody's always very quick to jump in and say hey I'm here to help what can I Do\nRight and we try to um [noise] at least for our\nFor our office you know I could say that you know we have a team concept office where\nYou know it's it's kind of mandatory that we kind of help each other out and and those are the people we want to work at ... executive ah oceanside or Jacksonville office you know because we're only as strong as our weakest person ... kind of comes from a cop days I guess but yeah you know you we we want to\nFind out who's the weakest link\nPolished them off and bring 'em up a level or two and um and the person that you know like Betty late and who's our top producer you know she she's taking Susan uh who's our newest age and she's here too and um\nYou know she's taking her under her wing and her yeah and so that's what we try to do and and Casey's a little more ahead 'cause she worked in property management so\nWorking with Casey and um and that's what we try to do in our office we want everybody to be successful and we want everybody to make money right um because that is the goal is is we want to put out there good executives to assist or public our ... our sellers and are by\nAll how badly you lose about ... about your customers would only about them or the people you buy houses for help to buy a house and give us hiring people\nLetting them go out there and do their own thing it's you know or shake their hand say hey welcome aboard you know it's\nIt's it's it's teamwork we want them to be top notch for our sailors some buyers okay and when we come back we're going to talk to Betty Laden\nAnd find out\nSome hot scoop in town [noise] some of her best properties out there and
