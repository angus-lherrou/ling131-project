I'm not at all guy but I'm not a young guy either and uh but I'm a sixty two I've got a been married to my wife care and she is native or she is my little Italian picks the her last name is cigna ready so we have a lot of Italian blood in our family just like Tomas has got the Hispanic side covered I got the tie inside\nCovered [laughter] exactly I at a dinner is our wonderful lecture oh man my mother\nMother was invited my wife [laughter] I'll wife has an excellent cook but I but I Do appreciate you have to be on the phone 'cause I've been out of office for Fifteen Years so a lot of folks don't remember\nOr maybe not who I Am but I've been a State Farm insurance agent for a long time\nAnd that's a great opportunity to take care of people and to help people manage the risk um\nAnd in addition I have served on the council and have enjoyed all three terms which would be twelve years I'm running currently for a at large council which means I Would represent the entire and anybody who lives in the entire county of do often the beaches the Baldwin\nTo the north through the south in the county can vote in everywhere in between can vote car loot she for at large group for uh\nThe uh what attracts me to really wanting to\nUh run is because I care I care about the city I had my entire adult life I have I have served in public service in some form or fashion my entire life is what makes me pick my father served before me for nearly Twenty years on the city council and he a wild up in the state Senate\nOr but he died young at age fifty seven\nAnd so but he made a a big impact here in Jacksonville in a\nWonderful you know there's there's a great there is no better place though to serve and to make a difference in your community for the future generations to come down on the on the jacks will city council\n[noise] that's very true and one thing I Want to make clear to everybody because um\nYou know I'm from Southern California a lot of our listeners know that and I've been here for for a little while now\nBut I still learning you know all the voting things you know the ... and and how everything works and so I open my ballot I'm going where's Mad Men it's not on a salad at my God you know and uh so\nYou're in March and so we need our people to understand that you're on the ballot on march nineteenth and it's important because a lot of people don't like to show up we have low turnouts for or that type of an election but they need to be there was some voters important\nWhat's ... what's important to remember is your state and federal officers their elections were in fall city elections or in the spring there's been attempts to combine them altogether to save a little money\nSo maybe that's the right thing to do maybe is not I don't think it has the right thing that they could get confused I think that um your fall elections allows you to focus strictly on those I'm a I'm a legislative a Senate a presidential race was et cetera\nBut local is totally different and\nIn local elections is really what affects you and your quality of life the most because when you pay those property taxes you pay for your tags whatever you pay whatever the you pay\nGoes to the city and hopefully those council members in the mayor what will take those dollars used them widely to increase the quality of life or enhance the quality of life of Jacksonville\nAnd that's really the secret to good economic development if the better quality of life we have\nThe more other businesses will want to come here and create better paying jobs and better quality jobs and so we need to be investing in our city to make it better\nNot so much for me and him and they end up but for a my the viewers ... the listeners their children\nOr maybe they have grandchildren we all want our children to stay here in Jacksonville I Know I got very little without making grandkids [laughter] I Wanna stay right here in Jacksonville but they need to make sure\nWithout making grandkids [laughter] I Wanna stay right here in Jacksonville but they need to make sure we need to make sure they have opportunities for good paying job so they don't have to go to Atlanta or Orlando or somewhere else\nCorrect I'm Glad you mentioned that because one of the things I wanted to discuss with you is that the growth downtown what are some of the things that are coming up and coming I'm\nDowntown well what's first of all of us really I think a great thing about downtown is is a lot of its its growth and the excitement about downtown now is\nMore what they call organic in other words it's just kind of happening naturally it's not being forced by a ... of a for lack of a better word a city incentives now city incentives will still play a role in bringing business in making downtown better but\nBut you got to make sure you're going to get a return on investment I think the return on investment is going to be better on city incentives for downtown projects because there's more interest in downtown but we've got to make sure that not only just downtown grow for businesses and restaurants and so forth\nBut we gotta make downtown a fun place not just when the jaguars are planned or when our our uh Jacksonville jumbo shrimp or a plane or the Iceman or any of the other teams we have\nWe need jak supposed to be a fun place for families that have young children that can take 'em down town\nWhere there's something fun to do now we have mosh which is the museum of science and history and there has to do a fabulous overhaul and expansion they've got great leadership there so that's going to mandate\nCouncilwoman Boyer is making some wonderful enhancements to the St Johns river park in Marino which is for friendship fountain is so that's going to be a fun place for young people to go\nAnd uh but we need other things like that on the north bank as well to make Jacksonville place where Tomas can take your children and have some fun\nAbsolutely because there there is still a lot to do down there and we have some great restaurants down there\nWe're going to get one more great when a a a ... domain the break in here but\nUh the lower strict trio which is one of my that's that was near and dear to my heart that's the most extraordinary corner in Jacksonville, Florida because those three buildings were built right after the great fire\nIn Nineteen oh to probably Jim night you know to actually had to yeah okay and so uh they're the most historic buildings downtown there being restored along with the Barnett\nThe marble bank buildings going to be a beautiful steak restaurant just like we have the chop house\nSo we want to have more good of you in a downtown and then you've got what shot cons doing at the entertainment center down by a the stadium and so forth I think there's a lot of great things happening uh Jacksonville and we want to be smart about it\nWe we we want to uh at Lincoln once said make haste slowly okay that was his quote so we want to we want to counter hurry up but we want to do it slowly\nImpulse police so short making good investments that land um it's right across from\nThe coffee Maxwell\nOh dusty ah that that's the whole ship yards I think most of the\nUm the there was a lot of um underground talk six in and contamination not the most of that's been cleaned up is going to take somebody with a lot of capital that might be shot con to invest into that like hell he lessons\nI Hope he's listening right now tell me that pullout that checkbook\nWell you know he's got to do was checkbook [laughter] I'm not going to be a workout and land on the on the far be it for me to tell a shot how to write the check but [laughter] but I think he is committed to Jacksonville, Florida ... he is because you know who brought him\nHere or who helped bring him here was Wayne lever and I will tell you there's very few people that had ever been as committed and as generous have Sarah my then lane endures waiver they they told me he is he was the right pick\nAnd you you can't make things happen too quickly but I think in the next ten years downtown will be a completely different looking at different things like um\nI think so too and I think it's headed in the right direction and maybe not as quick as people with like but\nIt's happening and that's what's important but we have a council that's determined to make that happen we also have a mayor who is very excited about downtown so\nThat's good saturated when you have those two working together and now they don't want to hold hands all the time there's gotta be some me this is a ... type of government of the legislative side in the ministry of science or there's got to be some debate\nBut let the debate bring the best idea up to the top and then whoever has the best idea wins and hopefully it it makes Jacksonville and even better place to live\nThat sounds wonderful and we're going to have more when we come back\nOn rapid fire real estate with Anita high up [noise]\nOr which are some people would say is a good thing and some people would say who's going to hurt the government a little bit uh the the problem with it is that uh somehow or other that's it's about twenty six or seven twenty eight million dollars or something like that from a cost of local government\nSo uh that's going out to be made up somehow or they're gonna have to make some cost cutting ... to uh to get to to to make it balance\nIf anybody has questions for these two we have a let's put 'em on the hot seat that's triple to talk triple to talk that's two two to eight to five five give us a call so we can ask some questions now you guys during the break we're talking about\nThe jags and I know I've got there's many jak fans here including myself and um [noise] our good friend Charlie ... oh my God yeah he's about the biggest fan I think I Know um\nAnd plus a little bit about the history behind that when it went to counsel because both of you guys were on it at the time\nRight or we were we were just talking about how the votes on the jaguars were ... worth of jak whereas at the time it was just touched down Jacksonville did we didn't have a team when we did the deal or and or at Austin was mayor ... both on the council and we were arguing back and forth about\nWhat to do about the the least we're going to lease the gator bowl a which is what it was known at the time or two this entity is touchdown Jacksonville they were going to\nGo out and get a team or are they said everybody said well we really can't get a team this is Jacksonville, Florida nobody's going to come here uh it'd be an NFL team so anyway so it was it was up in the air um uh the first least vote did not pass and Jake ... who was out in the river with a barge full of\nFirecrackers actually fireworks was going to set the fireworks off when the vote was totaled and and we passed the bill which I'm able to sing to start off and um the bill failed but Mr ... shot the fireworks off anyway\n[laughter] oh no [laughter]\nI think he was ... I did not know how you remember that yeah he he ended up man you can hold Jay God's will back in the heat and it would do the same thing today if he could of and in many ways we uh\nUh you know the the jaguars to going back to Jake God bold and Tommy Hillary and of course at Austin is who's a John Delaney worked with a a with general counsel but at Austin\nA brought the jaguars didn't want to solve planted but as kind of a sudden numbers you know it seemed like an easy idea to those markets such will say we want to football team\nBut what are the auditors were telling us is that if you don't average you know fifty five sixty thousand people in that stadium gay men and came out and it could start costing taxpayers additional dollar so it was a tight squeeze it was like a middle class person going out looking at an and escalate\nBut Jacksonville deserved team we wanted a team we had faith that we could they could happen but but I wasn't so convinced and so I really studied hard I'll tell you a funny story real quick\nOr the night before the vote by white ... being the but there is for ... beds users now don't be sticking a mutt I Want you to both those jaguars would be good projects the last well kind of leaning that way\nAnd uh so the next morning I get up about five o'clock as we get the newspaper because I always get up early got good newspaper had on the front page call your city kill some day let them know what you think about voting on the on the new jaguar least that was up again after the first one fails you guys get a lot of I got to city hall six o'clock\nPhone started ringing and I had a yellow pad front of me would yes as in those and I will tell you something interesting\nTo know these people wanted me to voting no was much longer than the list of voting yes so interesting let me tell you the difference in this was what really sold me and this is what's kind of a turning point in in the growth as as my council or in in governmental career\nThe people that were voting no just seemed to be I'm going to be careful how I say this but they were very um on positive about\nAh our ability to to have a team will never supported in and and it was a kind of a negative tone that I kept hearing over and over\nThe the people that were calling me for where younger people and they were saying this Carlos yeah this was their general just generally but they were saying it's not that we want a protein so bad what we want is the future for our city and we believe this is what's going to be great projects building gifts on the map\nAnd so I heard that message that they wanted some hope for their hometown and I said by golly I'm voting for hope and saw went in to end their voted I saw I think I was the the boat they needed to keep it from being veto which is what the Daytona anyway but it it it was a safety a vote didn't\nHave it yep hope hope to solve the awesome it's all let me tell you this job of being the council member\nAnd even what Jim suing Tomas is dealing with with getting candidates in front of people you're you're you're forcing us to talk about what do we think about the future of jak so what do we want to hear what are people telling us\nThat are starting then we'll be right back\nThere are some things you just don't have to do\nWhen it comes to vine or so in a home why not go right to the experts rule the
