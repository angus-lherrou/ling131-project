South Carolina rose Ron was mark\nHi Mark you're doing a great job thank you very much\nUm my combat lies these people from the caravan carrying black from their country which makes me feel like they're invading our country when you get caught tree that's an act of war\nAnd I would say we should treat it like an act of war declare that make them more gecko ration your mama whatever country they're holding and get in the hell out of here\nAnd that's the most incredible thing of all roads that they come into this country with no gratitude the way our ancestors came by to talk about it Ellis Island they would never have carried flags from their home countries they were seeking freedom they were ... staking a new life\nThe whole point and it's so discouraging when they come here they bring a lot of the same culture in terms of even voting for people like try to get away from the get away from governments we try to tell them what to do with their lives and they both the same thing when they get here let's go to Paul in Littleton, Colorado Paul you're on with mark\nHey mark veteran taking my call Sean hey I wanted\nTo follow up on your comment earlier about the term illegal alien a button and a different a vein a you know the advocates of amnesty and high levels of immigration of always described the\nIllegal alien population is one made up of otherwise law abiding people who've done nothing more than cross the border illegally mhm\nFor the reality is is that they're coming here for jobs\nIn order to find a job they've got to fill out an ionized foreign when they do that and say they're here legally they commit perjury which is a felony or the other thing is is that they routinely make up Social Security numbers or feel somewhat Social Security numbers\nA surfer Immigration Studies suggest that about Seventy five percent\nOf the illegal aliens are here\nTo work uh have been violating these laws but nobody ever mentions it or not otherwise law abiding it's simply a myth or my daughter was actually a victim of a I D theft by illegal alien using her Social Security number was restored and when she was a child\nMhm so uh I don't know why the uh conservatives Republicans don't\nPush back on this whole illegal thing a fight by describing what's happening here in internally when people come here to work [noise]\nYeah just a one one of the many problems with this whole thing it just seems obvious to me\nThere's got to be an orderly procedure that house someone gets into a country we call the legal immigration you have a plan that makes sense you give the opportunity to to the people you want to give the opportunity to\nSeem so obvious to me and that's why you have to have the when the language war because otherwise they put it in terms of ripping babies away from immigrant children and having immigrants always been\nA terrific a boost to the United states of America yeah legal immigrants but you changed the language let's go to Rick in the Bronx Rick you're on was mark\nThanks for taking my call mark I guess for one thing that changed the ...\nI mean if you're like this caravan of course they want they want they either\nContented at ... and the out a yellow El Salvador Guatemala and decent people what's in those countries that pose countries not just gangs and dogs and search team at all what you want to tell\nYou all know the real point is I thought you were getting too they aren't all good people that they are they're going to be terrorists among them they're going to be people that don't value the ideals that we do in the United states of America forgive me even people with disease right they haven't been ... as one caller pointed out so you have\nTo have some means of doing this some orderly process that's the whole point his argument seems such such an easy one to win if you frame it in the right terms use the right language you know be compassionate people okay you want to come to this country I think we let a million people in a year\nThere's a way to do it here the rules here the procedures you have to follow them which President Trump to Republicans are going to lose this when either way right you call out the national guard or whatever you do you stop them from coming in what you got to do your evil bad guys as Obama said ripping children away from their mothers and everybody joins in with that right\nAnd if you uh don't stop them you have an invasion you have people coming in these people aren't coming in for some of that may be as some of them but a lot of them we know that kind of I don't blame them by the way the coming in for jobs that come into the benefits were\nThe ones to blame let me know what you're saying ...\nSeven seven six more times to filling in for Dennis\nDennis
