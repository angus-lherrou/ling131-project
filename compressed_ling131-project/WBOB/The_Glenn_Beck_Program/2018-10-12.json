bell to the you know Hi\nDennis I ah I'm looking forward to your book on genesis I gave a your book on that for this to my paths or to a Jewish friend of mine he was delighted and to my brother my brother called me and said in his wife had just been talking about God and didn't know where to start in my book arrived the next day so\nThat oh that is fortuitous who that is not mere coincidence rich\nI Know my question as a as a Christian I'm Jewish brother um\nYou are writing books which I'm really looking forward to on the Torah and is the Torah equal to all the other book for the Bible is got inspired or the tar superior superior books it's superior\nYou bought a truck and I think they're all the word of God that's\nCorrect I think there are there are a number of differences in the way Christians and Jews approach\nThe Old Testament and there are two really there are two that are are are probably the most glaring\nOne you just mentioned for the Jew\nAnd this has always been true the tour of the first five books the five bucks a ... some Christians will also call us ... or or an exalted status in fact the only ones that are considered in traditional Judaism as divine books\nThe other books or where it says God said the traditional drew believe Scott said so God said to ... than the traditional drew believe God said this was there\nBut if you have a song for example uh this will this will be the authors it you know in that case king David uh usually and that is or you know proverbs by king Solomon traditionally\nAh but ... that's not the word of God there they can be inspired but it's not the same as the first five books\nI'd say by the way I think Jesus would have looked at it that way to adjust to a ... speaking to you as a Christian I Jesus being a very traditional Jew would have said the same thing I Am he would have regarded the Torah as uniquely a significant\nI certainly will ponder that I I don't know that I I agree with that but I Will\nCertainly don't know exactly anyway the issue is not even agreement the issue is us how does the juicy it you know ... on on matters of face\nA you know I always said if I don't I don't expect agreement and it's not even a significant to me so so so there's different show up but the it's the values that's why we speak of Judeo Christian values about Judeo Christian theology\nI I agree but I guess is the book of Isaiah for example divinely inspired\nNo where God Speaks to why you say it is just as much God as God Speaking in the Torah but but where you have other statements that it doesn't say and God said so then it's as I said like proverbs or ecclesiastical ... that is not from God\nOkay well that's a that's out for clarification of a difference is that I I understand that\nGood God Bless you and I mean thank you so much Cokie and Kevin in North Hollywood, California Hi\nYes yes Hi Dennis I have a question for you yes\nOkay show yesterday pounds you had mentioned
