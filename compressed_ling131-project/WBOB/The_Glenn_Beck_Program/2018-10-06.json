B. O. B. O. R. G.\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the third our here shorter appreciate all of your joining us financial issues\nI'm Dan serious great to be here of course we our lives are thank you for being with us we have lines open two lines open\nA four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three great found a few you're caught we are going to get a to your question so you might want to keep your car right now I'm just going to give it a little bit of recap what's going on in the markets right now in this October third\nWednesday October third so\nAll the indices and positive territory all of them are then as the actual cover a little bit so technology stocks you a little bit of a boost here from something I'm not sure why but nonetheless a day I was up to half a one percent so is the as the five hundred or so that's a very good news and the CIA reports\nUh came out and we're seeing the largest rise in crude oil supplies\nOr that we have seen uh let's see so far this year eight\nMillion barrels\nThey are going to be hard pressed and the refinery industry and gas stations\nTo try to convince me now that gas prices are to keep a rising by the way gas prices at the pump national average opted to Ninety a gallon that's up from two eighty eight yesterday\nEight million barrel rise in inventory we were expecting I should say we but based on a pie I was expecting about three million barrels that's what I said yesterday we got an eight million\nBarrels now\nThat's a compared to an increased by the way of two million\nThe week before that\nWe also and they were forecasting about that to just over two and a half million for a oil and we get eight million that is huge it's a large has increased\nUm their it sounds to me like they're working out some of the infrastructure some of the transportation problems in crude oil obviously they are particularly from the Permian Basin we're starting to get and they were getting more trucks on the roads pipelines coming online\nA bus transportation problem continue to get stopped it that happens that's going to be good now gasoline stockpiles did fall by only five hundred thousand barrels that's not a huge\nUm so and and stockpiles of distilled declined by one point eight million barrels so plenty of oil to get now understand\nNot ... I'm Sorry gasoline supplies dropped because they were still doing the turnaround a which isn't as big a turnaround as it is in the spring to get to win or gasoline\nAnd so obviously they weren't putting out a lot of gasoline into\nSupplies are inventories that's going to change now that's going to so we're going to start to see gas gasoline inventories come up as they use up some of this eight million barrels we can get into the lead situation if they don't and then gas prices are really going to come down so we'll see hope\nA lot situation if they don't and then gas prices are really going to come down so we'll see hopefully that would be great wouldn't be great if we end up headed into the Christmas season with lower gasoline prices lot lower gasoline prices will see this is only one week we have to see if this holds so that's a big news oil prices\nHave um\nClimbed very closely very closely to a four year high now they have been on the decline here this morning there were down last look about point for four percent\nUh last time I looked right now they have turned up positive that's odd based on this report but they are per turn positive and backup over Seventy five dollars about Seventy five point thirty one\nAnd I'm like oh I agree with your show and I truly the kind of\nGet back to the political commentary on opening I really wish I could list [laughter]\nWell sometimes too brutal but I appreciate that uh [noise] but the but sometimes to pass you can get [laughter] get carried away but um with with becoming too brutal but you know what we uh we sure need it\nSometimes don't we it's it's a\nIt's a great wakeup calls are lured late to play some of those things in my heart so thank you for that day I appreciate you saying that [noise]\n[noise] yeah and that's on a ... or ... military currently working for the okay\nWe're comfortable as far as going but I really feel like the lord has called me to teach and hopefully over the country maybe close to the teachers mhm\nMy I guess my question is like my teachers degree through Liberty University on line mhm so I'm looking at going to the inner city kind of see\nWhat would you what are the next two extra to contribute or do I need to come\nSo once you leave your G. S. job you won't be able to contribute to it any more\nYou know so I Would move it unless you think\nYou're going to come back um you know to to um service in the government in some way shape or form where you could pick it back up and start contributing other than that I Would rather you David have more options\nThan what you have at the T. S. T. so that you can get a little bit more diversified while you're gone [noise] so\nYou're saying to it and yes and I\nYeah I mean you could do that you can roll into Timothy and diversify to other mutual funds or you can roll would into a brokerage account and diversified into some sympathy fun to some other things but I definitely think you want more a diversification\nAnd and you shoot roll it over to not going to cost you anything they won't be any penalties are taxes\nUm and I think that just makes good sense to do that\nAny recommendation [noise]\n[noise] well I tell you if you think that you are at a place that you think you could possibly settled down some day\nThen you know it'd be great if you're going to have an opportunity to rent it out if that's something that you can do in your area you can do that in a way that it can be managed I'm with somebody that's got a good reputation in real estate firm to manage them Reynolds\nAnd if there are opportunities um to get tenants\nI assume you live somewhere around um\nYou know us as a military facility that has some some transients ah military person [noise]\n[noise] yeah [noise] [laughter]\nWell that's what I like to hear um um because I'm In the same situation so from that perspective I wouldn't have a problem with you and also in it um I Would have that money though when you sell it in a somewhat of a separate account and what I mean by that is\nKind of have it in a camp where yeah I've got a couple a government bomb funds or ... or something like that but not a lot of risk you know the kind of a camp that is that is going to be fairly stable\nUm in any case or something happens where a that could be a good a fall back at some point in time where you say man I'm going to you know I've got a I've got to an operator\nBack at some point in time where you say man I'm going to you know I've got a I've got an opportunity to serve the lord and in a you know somewhere in\nTennessee or North Carolina or wherever it might end up being and uh you can you can pull that money out of there without a too much of an impact so I think I think that's what you want to do with it in that case just just sell it in and move any equity over into a good safe secure\nA account [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah I think I think the housing market is depends on what goes on with the elections are the elections go the wrong direction and November I think the algae market's going to start to turn sour\n'em over the next two years and I think that's I think the housing market you're going to be I think I Am saying that if that happens today is a good seller's market may be as good as going to be for a while\nIf that doesn't happen then um you know obviously I think appreciation or an end demand could still rise\n[noise] All right thank you David what's your all the best than a\nThank you for your service the all of us and a thank you for the service to the kingdom that you're going to continue to do and I sure do appreciate [noise]\nAll right thank\nYou so much God Bless his heart let me a a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three we've got some lines open here let me go to Cathy Cathy is calling us from North Carolina Cathy\nGood morning and thank you for taking my call your ah\nFirst of all I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed listening to your program she or an ... an hour able to be blessed to take early retirement that she or he just turned ... great mhm and I'm fifty eight so you're pro American minutes said had been there a blessing\nTo oh good good\nUm my skin E S that obviously when I was hired I for one K. at my job at all it's not and we're looking to see a roll it over\nA probably into Kennedy and the cuts we want to beat it looked like a typical my question she ate it repeat upcoming election should we wake\nTo whatever I can go ahead and do that the weak dollar cost averaging hand I think that they're not money market IRA and the dollar cost in the end I just rolled it ever lifetime\nHere's what I Would do I would road over now\nI'm Timothy other words I Would get the account set up so now you have to hire a accounts set opportunity I Would roll those over I tell them that you want it ought to go into the money market account for now and then in the um\nAfter the election\nRegardless of what turned down the election I Would start dollar cost averaging it in um to the various funds on our asset allocation model\nOr a cat and they will they will look at that for you if you ask them to so that and what yeah go ahead\nWhat percentage dollar cost averaging and like I Would ... I Know I Would probably a dollar cost the average in\nUm you know the I Would divide or whatever you have by by yeah I guess for\nFor would work that would be the end of the more than ... end of the year two dollar cost averaging in over a the next four months so whatever you have divided by four star dollar cost averaging that in every month for the next four months after ... after the election\nPark I think he's done that and then face such a blessing to than many yeah\nOh You're welcome thank you I sure appreciate your saying that can't thank you Cathy God Bless 'em a four four seven or seven fifty five thirty three a four four seven or seven fifty five\nThirty three if you want to hear your car or folks I also ah you just heard Jaffe their attack is for us American ministries and you know it really is a a an incredible thing is such a blessing and a I Would love to see more and more people young\nMiddle age old singles married kids or whatever the situation is I think it's critically important that we do a couple of things you know\nGod gave us a plan healthcare like you gave us a healthcare play God reminds us in collisions\nThat I don't I don't know the chapter and verse I should I think it's chapter three don't know diverse early single digit first start ups are starting to come to me but [noise] um\nAnyway where to share one another's burdens or in the book of acts you know we see a plan that you know we we've come together with our dollar as we help each other we support each other in every way that's what Samaritan ministries is just the health care plan that is designed by God for God's people\nAnd it is amazing ah my wife and I've been using it just over three years now um we said do well over well over twelve hundred dollars a month\nI'm ... but I can tell you you're going to probably save\nYou know if you're really young you're going to save three hundred dollars if you're above thirty it's probably going to be closer to four or five hundred dollars and and onward an aunt or ... I mean the savings is is um amazing but more importantly you become a better Stewart of your family's health care\nSo here's Noah with his family\nSaving Fifteen hundred dollars a month you can put some of that money in a health savings account which some of that money in your savings account\nIrregular savings account and you can spend some of that money it's a great great thing\nAnd and that extra two or three hundred dollars a month that you spend you all of a sudden I'm not saying you don't care totally\nBut you care less about gasoline prices going up because you're freed up some of your cash flow and it's not impacting your your lifestyle in any way to great\nThank you know I'm Glad you share that with all of us let me go to Elaine Elaine calling us from Florida highly\nHi I'm Michael in our ten thousand dollars to put away for her kids college three children of her and she doesn't know what to do [laughter]\nHow how old's the oldest Fifteen okay she'll be fixed and the youngest is nine\nOkay so she has to be careful because the money is going to start getting drawl drawing on 'em in three years for the oldest one I'm safe is three years maybe for\nShe she had five twenty nine guy already but she does okay yeah how long does it put it in there and not\nYeah so how long has she had the five twenty nine point\nOh probably about five years but she doesn't have that much in Germany I probably would\nYeah I Would put it in that but the ... yeah I think that's probably kind of a I think that's probably the ...

hate to say this 'cause I don't want people going out really necessarily him and buying of it but I'm saying anyway\nI mean I think that uh we're probably going to see a silver and gold both are in the next couple of years two to three two to four years start defined it'll balance and maybe start to pick up a bit [noise]\nUm the silver or does the one thing nice about silver and has an industrial use\nUnlike gold so a silver could potentially benefit\nFrom you know a a real thriving growing economy from the technology perspective so\nI'm silver benefit by that we could start to see silver prices you know get up to sixteen Seventeen dollars I'm but I'm not saying that's definitely going to happen but I Would probably at this point hold on to it now if you paid\nYou know nine
