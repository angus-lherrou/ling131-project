hundreds of clinical studies that just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger\nAnd healthier at any age now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokes person and a longtime advisor for purity products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover it today packed they were talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's\nImpacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea Team right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly used\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAn amazing story you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being\nTo maintain strength and power it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of but however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties\nSeventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all of this stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nThey go to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumped up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how eliminate athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about it\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrition so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course he knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat and the problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have a large amounts of red meat is like four\nPounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian say can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel that way where they want to feel and I put 'em on average strong\nHe noticed it benefits almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that average grow\nSo obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties\nAthletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp Steve vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me pat in fact let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men\nStudy done it several American universities or group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts\nBut you're also saying there's a big push nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea teen to stay fit strong and healthy pi you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with me for my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nIs that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream that says it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take crazy and then they don't\nHave an exercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance\nMuscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health\nAs well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training and the elderly could potentially delay atrophy\nOf muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line\nPre teen is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bono pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle will be twelve energy melts\nJust by calling us it one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred\nFive eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later in the show first Dutch eleven now listeners can only get ever strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right Oh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on him for those who don't know\nTalked about how these work so well together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy\nAll of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure creed and that's a curious to find this pre teen from Europe if you bought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month\nBut you're not going to spend that today and that was purity products and your name or going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this stuff flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five per shipping we want to get it right out you\nKnow we want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it try it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing Sherry Barry powder so how do you like to take it and give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets her powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it\nIt was both you know I'm I work at these days and making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDumping right into your juice dump it into your protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study and sports nutrition and this is on our strong formula the products we're talking about right now the average strong powder so\nDouble blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong power for one month in one month and they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey hold our guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job but you had five hundred dollars on a driver up five yards right this is for team\nYards ... people shouldn't just how how about this or you're on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again these golfers\nOne month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging a golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine that you get your bottle of ... you don't tell your buddies take it for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWow I Would just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know what at my one concern with this show\nIs it literally it sounds too good to be true right right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen I almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile from everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong\nYou're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these aren't studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere we're talking human studies I called stuff muscle fertilizer it's that great and of course we didn't just there to create pure Korea Team we've discussed that we are the fruit XP remember that joined health weight\nOf the coffee Barry extract that nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful antioxidant protection I added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board\nFree for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get

protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol\nAnd one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that Kirk human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so it\nCauses your body to produce these agents in the brain that protect the actual to issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times\nThe absorption of any other Kirk human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion is one of the most life enhancing protective totally beneficial substances on earth\nAnd it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the current human your new green tea yarn liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today but first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the rich and rich room which is super hot right now I'm sure some of the headlines and the science behind her spiritual I Know some red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about ... ... is that like\nGreen tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body that happen during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and\nInsulin insensitivity ... helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French\nParadox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but ... appears to be key in that\nAnd additionally there is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin with blood flow to the brain\nSo when you take resveratrol you'd get brain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Christmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you greeted to junction maturity ...

R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first\nWhat does this G R D and foreign second you designed this formula in a liquid ... why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human\nOr is there a troll the big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amounts the reason that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid and a very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluids soft shell you just happen to get\nMore quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption into the intestines\nThat means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients and the supplements so green T. C. R. as green tea Kurt came in ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredient\nOf course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary bottle of ... show me do you want to do by this green tea plus the patented B. C. M. Ninety five ... there was very rich role I mean you spent close to properly least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles and store\nAnd yet today purity ... giving away free bottle how are they able to do this\nWell you can consider it kind of a smart bat and what I mean by that first of all these big but they're also very strategic they know\nThat if a person who's listening will pick up the phone call in and get their free bottle and it really is free as in free than it doesn't cost you money if that person will try the product take it as recommended they're going to feel it and when they feel that they're going to say\nGee I Want this as part of my regular daily regimen so\nPurity is really betting beyond the free bottle they're betting that people will have a positive experience that they'll say gosh I like this I Love the way I feel on green T.
