officer oh grand job that's gone well and uh but yes I Am in the Senate and are working hard\nOr northeast Florida you know people don't realize this guy's we sure do I'm sure that being a member of the legislature is not for at the state level is not a fulltime job so you've got another career going on on top of everything right part time job this salary is shocking to most it's twenty eight thousand nine hundred dollars so that's it so uh it's part-time\nBits fulltime work part time\nPart time so most people are just they have another job may I ask you if they have a family didn't

license I was a broker at one time and um I remember going back in the days when we were doing selling real estate\nAh it was tight it was tight and so I was substitute teaching because I needed to know that I was going to have at least a couple of hundred dollars for the week to be able to pay our mortgage to pay a diapers and everything so I have that and then\nBoy when you made a sale it was the most exciting thing ever to bring a buyer and seller together and\nIt wasn't very it's very rare and it was it was for you now it's that we were talking earlier your your team is just rock and right now they\nAre I Am so proud of them and uh we do have an office out in front of a ... because of all the gross out there um I Love driving out there for one I Love to go to the island when I Need to just a quick weekend I Love going out there 'cause I feel like a miles away\nBut my last tour over there when I took a drive I cannot believe all the construction going on all the growth\nAnd I know you had a lot to do with that um he went toe to toe with with a developer 'em and you saved your a community a lot of money I'm On taxes if I'm not mistaken once\nYou tell us a little bit about that\nWell I was the former mayor I mean the the struggle as a as a local official early is to keep\nKeep it nice of that to set of guidelines and uh uh\nTo to enforce the voting laws and to make sure it's a nice place up everybody wants to move in and build everything out but to keep it\nI guess I had a nice community burning the Nassau County I Know we talked about the uh the wild light a development which is gonna be a I think a big plus for all of northeast Florida\nAnd are currently Nassau County and wildlife officials are\nAre disagreeing on some things I'm working hard on bring them together I think there's going to be a happy ending down the down the road there's a couple of meetings coming up where I Believe both both sides will come together in a work things out to the benefit of the taxpayers as well as a future residents of northeast Florida\n[noise] and that if I'm not mistaken is I'm\nBringing a lot of new schools parks and um you're looking at probably twenty four thousand residence\nThis is over a long period of time um eleven million square feet of non residential use including office light a industrial and commercial but this is over a long many years\nIt's like a mini ... if you're familiar I mean if you had to be a city in itself there's already a school what's what's mind blowing about uh the wildlife development is they one of the first things that was built a is an elementary school wildlife elementary before the first house is out of the ground\nElementary before the first house is out of the ground the school is filled for six hundred kids stole my guys already full forward thinking yeah that's a\nReally you know strategy to get an immunity on your side\nRight as well and you didn't get a great job with that and I know it's ongoing struggle but um you seem to um to have done a great job and from what I understand they were trying to get out of pain but fifty million\nWell it's still it's really still a source of a debate\nOf the two sides of who's paying for for what I've helped Nassau County or the county commission or in a in trying to bring both sides to the table so it's ongoing as we speak right now but the next month or some key meetings I Believe both sides are getting them together and I\nI'm an optimist I expect a happy ending\nWell I tell ya if people are having a driven out there they really need to go up and take a look 'cause a lot is happening on Nassau County right now a lot of growth I Know we're happy about it\nOh yeah ... I remember a time before senator being before a representative being the former mayor the [laughter] it was a realtor being and I've\nTo ask you this question putting on your hindsight real estate professional ... Ninety nine thousand dollars or a cottage on the ocean front of a fern into you know if you've bumped it up a little bit a buck and a quarter were and ocean front home\nIn front of you know wouldn't our world be different ... up a few of those and made that recommendation to me yeah I'm Out there\nMy belly in the sand and Vernon Dana expecting houses and all\nYou had listings at a hundred grand on the ocean front and I got like nothing for ... I don't understand that\nWe were talking earlier about or just seeing prices seeing prices houses that are that I listed a long time ago houses that we've all lived in now and what they're selling for prices are just just a skyrocket\n... they ... I have a thousand dollar cottage on the ocean to ban is goes praised roughly ... ... and it truly was a a shack it would be nine hundred to a million dollars oh\nYeah that is tremendous the dirt alone huh there alone\nMy first house that I bought in uh in Ninety two I'm thirty eight thousand dollars and uh\nNever thought I Would live in it of course I got married I told my wife will never lived there and of course I carried or across the threshold that's our new house on you know we had to sell that when they get to the next one we have to sell out here and get to the next one and uh but\nThat first house at thirty thousand dollar house I think just sold for uh just under three ... three hundred two hundred and fifty I mean it just makes a good pretty amazing I have no part of it I'm just\nFor a guy who make six bucks an hour as a state senator and I guess we'll see you guys are generous [laughter] it's rapid\nFire here I I had no idea how I Am at me rapid fire that where the rock star or the way that we have a I have a question I was looking at some of your\nGoals and you have some um which we are going to talk a little bit about each of them but you're very interested in creating jobs that become careers or jobs in ... new businesses to the area explain how you plan on doing this [noise]\nWell it's creating programs I guess working with the schools and creating vocational ed programs in Nassau County we created a a a joint use the ... that's really doing well right now a joint used facility that are high school uses\nA and also a high school uses during the day but our Florida State colleges Jacksonville uses that night that teaches a variety of different skills and trade to ah\nTo kids and young adults ... so they can move forward with a with a job companies right now and while he knows his too we talked about it earlier they're looking for talent they're looking for people who can fill\nFill jobs in what's becoming scarce\nRight into the workforce development what some of the areas that you think of the companies that are either considering er here already need the most for someone interested in going back to school\nIt is literally all across the board and all across the board we did a bill this past year about I'm excited about really to help veterans okay that or if you've a been a plumber in the army for however long five years and years Twenty years uh\nYou you get out of the army should you have to start all over because the state of Florida doesn't recognize that you're uh have any skills\nIn plumbing and so we tried to fix that and took some steps to say state of Florida recognized experience in credentials from the military and variety of things whether it's fixing an air conditioning or bombing or ... or electric\nYeah always surprised when I first heard that was not the case you know because you know you're trained for areas and they're doing it to defend the country at the highest level of of skill and expertise but then when you go to civilian life none of that experience I guess up until this law was passed it was passed but we tried to do and I was really a\nGood that's fantastic that is awesome because my son is in the military so I'm excited about that [noise] stay with us and give us a call on I Know for tripled see you're taught that struggle to eight to five five [noise]\nAnd let's ask parent beans some hard questions [laughter]\nI'm excited to have you here Sarah [noise]\nGives us the Medicaid money that you're giving other states that would make a tremendous difference but do it in a way that brings free market forces to Florida where people get to uh use\nThat money to purchase their own policy rather than be put on a government type of program\nI think the market forces are a great way to make health care accessible and affordable\nThat bill passed the Florida Senate did not pass the or the Florida House but any way that we can use a consumer choice and competition those are the key things that are going to make a difference in Floridians access to health care\nThis past year a bill was passed\nTo allow doctors to\nHave a practice without getting certified by the insurance industry by the by\nThe a ... hour which is the uh which is a division of Florida that puts a lot of red tape on a doctor's practice well we have broken that free where a doctor can offer his his services or hair services for cash and we think that's going to again to bring competition and choice to the marketplace\nVery good that at that that answer your question\nReally guys thank you so much\nJane thanks for ah for illicit and Jane thank you and I enjoy your show\nThank you well that was the question\nWas you know ... one area where the\nThe actual ... customer very often had doesn't have any say on who they want to use you know that's determined often by big insurance carrier that's ... by the employer if we did a grocery shopping that way\nYou know if the only reason why we accept it you know imagine if you're you know well new order to buy groceries because of cost prohibited the nature of it you you have to go to where the employer decided you would be using and you can't go to public she got to go you know another one maybe all all do whatever they want us all to all these or whatever it might be\nGreat in your job would just be grateful that you got you know food coverage of as an employee benefits and um you know ... things that were the consumer can make choices themselves ethic that drives competition and makes it more affordable and then it also gives incentives to health care providers to be as innovative is they can to be better way to\nExactly especially like you said you know you are um you hold the children close to your heart and this here there's a lot of people that don't have and this gives them the opportunity of perhaps being able to afford to go in to get that to get checked\nOut we've got a challenge in our health system though in it at the uh analogy that I've given if I Know that Wylie is going to be paying for dinner when he takes me for dinner I'm going to order I Know he's not as much as I can but if I Know I'm going to pay for it then I'm going to be much more frugal\nAnd an inch and it wasn't as an insurance company paying more consumer doesn't isn't this cost conscious as they need to be as if it were their own their own money\nWe've got to figure out a way to harness that and that's why we want to bring free market and choice in to the to the marketplace a as a way of controlling cost\nI have a real quick as it relates to our money amendment one coming up to expand homestead exemption another twenty five thousand dollar exemption I understood that locally that impact could be as much as a loss of twenty eight million dollars\nHow what is the balance between not wanting to pay any more and the impact on services overall as we look locally and across the state if that amendment were to pass well\nThat is a great question real estate in Russia's any homeowner nose or how they value their homes that exemption if you talk to a\nIf you talk to somebody who thinks they paid too much in taxes they're going to say we do need an increase in our homestead exemption it's been many many years since it's increased as we've talked about real estate values have skyrocketed now\nOr if you talk to somebody and local government because the bulk of that money goes to a local government rice or they're going to say wait a minute this is this is our bread and butter money this is how we provide the\nServices are to them I've already voted for this in in the Florida Legislature I think it is time to have an additional a levee of protection for the homeowners in the state of Florida\nAre the latest polls show that's a that's an iffy if if the state of Florida is going to\nGo either way right now is it takes sixty percent of all the amendments sixty percent and uh right now there's lots of if he thinks of that that are out there to be settled from our governor to our cabinet races to the uh to be all the amendments that are out there as well which makes it exciting\nAt the bottom line though your vote counts and I know you're out of relentless Roger that dean talked about that every morning your vote counts who do it it truly does it does make a difference for a single one of them\nGive us a call at the triple to talk that struggle to eight to five five and we'll be right back on WB obey [noise]\nThere are some things you just
