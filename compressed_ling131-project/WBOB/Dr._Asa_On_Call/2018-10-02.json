more conventional wisdom says you breathe the man on a mission to retire American one version at a month he spoke\nAbout the ... radio show today we're talking about a concept that they think I got out of a copy book somewhere uh although I Do believe to quote from Einstein which is how you see the problem is the problem\nAnd um when you\nTie that to this other state which is you can't solve the problem with the same level of thinking the problem was created at a you come to the point where you realized\nThat whatever it is in life you're going to try to accomplish it's going to be limited if you start with the first base assumption being wrong\nSo that you a question have you ever been speaking have you ever been in place where you're speaking to someone and they're talking about something and you're going they have no idea what they're talking about their base assumption in this whole thing is completely wrong\nNow you could look at politics for example and you have the trickle down\nEconomics theory and then you have the\nMass wealth redistribution theory and both of those basic the Democrat and Republicans theories are a completely different point of view how the world really works and to this date they both keep trying to prove that their theory of economics is correct\nBut the reality is they're both off in some manner because if you let either one of the to stay in power long enough they will end up destroying society one way or the other\nBecause the base assumptions that they live by our off how much the off by well there's an old saying if you think about this I'm a different way to look at it as if you were to go\nAnd try to walk a straight line it's almost impossible to walk a straight line and you realize that you veer off by a fraction of an inch and every step and eventually that practice which allows you to end up miles away from where you thought you'd go\nThey've done experiments with this people just don't have it in their brain good walk straight the only way you could walk straight\nPeople just don't have it in their brain good walk straight the only way you can walk straight is to focus on something that's way out in front of you and walk towards it that's the only way you can walk straight you have to be focused on something that's real and that's the problem\nYour idea about finances the way you see the world\nIsn't real it's based on a mistake in theology that has been handed down from century ... century\nIn this country probably in other countries I don't know because I'm not live there are no ... the algae of their belief system but it ours I Know since I was a kid everything I've ever heard from my grandparents or great grandparents was the only way to get ahead financially is to get a great\nJob that's it\nHow do you make money you get a good job work leads to money now there's all kinds of derivatives off of that wrong assumption\nOne of them is I Need to work a lot so you lose your life your life it's miserable because I was working sixty eighty hours a week when I worked in corporate America my wife was miserable and did I make a lot of money I made almost no money I think I mean Seventy thousand bucks a year which is how I look at it now that's nothing\nThat's almost nothing\nRight [noise]\nJust insane\nYou know by the time you take it home ... thirty five hundred dollars a month\nYet I thought I was semi successful because I had a good job I thought was a good job but it wasn't a good job and the reason that I wasn't getting anywhere with because of the base assumptions a second base suction everybody as you need to save a little money\nOkay that's a great idea there's nothing wrong with that I did all that is probably a starting place for finances to be good but what is a little amount of money\nYou have a wrong assumption about what you think you can save one or two or five percent of your income\nAnd save up enough money to get richer insane\nWhen I was young my assumption was I Will live on half of what I earned in every year I'll Try to earn more so I get to a little bit higher\nA level so when I made you know thirty thousand dollars a year I Lived on Fifteen when I made forty I Lived on twenty when I got to Seventy I Lived on thirty five\nWhen I got to a hundred thousand a year I Lived up fifty when I got the two hundred dollars I Lived on a hundred and when I got to five hundred thousand a year I Lived on a hundred when I got two million a year I Lived on a hundred two hundred and fifty\nBecause at that point I didn't need to live on even half of it for me to have a decent life\n\nBy making that different assumption to not say five or ten percent but to save half at least half\nHas made me rich another assumption how large about how should Yom I've never owned a home that was worth more than one year's pay\n... repeat that I've never owned a home the total more than one year's pay\nI've never owned a home that I had to pay thirty your mortgage on [noise] I bought houses I could afford to own and live in I\nHave a beautiful sixteen thousand square foot home right now pay cash for twenty car garage beautiful place costs me next to nothing compared to the income I made the year I bought it\nSo you you think about this what the solutions are you living on\nA guy in the rate of the other day talking to Dave Ramsey and the guy the guy had a forty thousand dollar pickup truck\nAnd he had a forty thousand dollar your job [laughter] you don't have a home equal to what your you know so he's got a car equal to what happened is their annual salary was these are bad assumptions guys\nReally bad as some what's another bad assumption another bad assumption is college will always get you higher paying job\nThat's a bad assumption in when I was growing up they had statistical data that showed if you\nUh graduated from high school\nYou earn thirty thousand a year if you got one year of college and you turned thirty five have yet to years yet associate degree you're forty or fifty it'd be at a four year college degree you're sixty or Seventy be at a doctor's degree or a master's degree you could hurt a hundred thousand and if you had a doctor's degree you could earn in a hundred and fifty thousand\n[noise] and they had the statistical data right\nBut how has that data been used to create a situation where eighty percent of our kids coming out of high school now are going into college for stupid degrees spending tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars going into debt\nTo get a degree in something that can't even get a job in\nThat's a bad assumption and the thing that's interesting guys\nIs it like on the trains that what I found out and this is why I'm doing the show today about this like I found on the trains that deal when you make a bad assumption you finally get to the end of the road\nAnd you say whoa you're standing at the edge of political I can go no further with this idea it will not take me any further next step is off the cliff now you got to turn around and go back going back and sometimes more painful than struggling to get where you're at\nI have to let all the stuff go and do all this stuff I did and then figure out the right stuff to do see that's the real challenge folks isn't here you are thirty forty fifty sixty years of age and your rent that edge that cliff looking on the outside going oh my God I've done it all wrong\nNow a lot\nWell guess what you're going to have to go back and start over because you can't take what you've already\nDone and turn that into when we'll take a short break we'll be right back on the radio show [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nAnd they have these needs\nTo get what they want it that they're driven when they want something they are insane or in my fiance is one of these type of ... and stuff she does based areas if she wants something shooting on her phone get on the Internet and she will shop for twenty four hours straight until she gets what you want\nI mean it's just to watch or it's ferocious now on that same side of her that ferocious knows when she goes and attacks a problem\nLike when I sat around to a health club or helps her out to apartment complex was an operating effectively she used that same ferocious ... to attack that problem she's a problem attacker challenge\nShe gets bored so whatever it was she bought that she loves she bored with it no time at all and want something else she needs constant new stimulation to keep going\nTo\nGo further on type a personalities\nType it provides a basic belief systems\nOne of them is if you stick thrown up mud on the wall something's got to stick so they take the shotgun approach to doing things whatever it is they do they're doing a lot of things all the same time trying to get it all done has what happens with the type a personality their weight to almost everything they do\nBecause they under estimate the amount of time it takes to accomplish the minute the middle line cast between going from a to B C D dig thinking I can\nGet all that stuff done in no time at all they want to put five things on their car to get done today and the only get one or two of them done and everything else just gets lost in the shuffle gets put off because they try to put too many things on the car to the same time [noise] another one is they don't think of the long term they don't think\nIn the means of\nHow what will the outcome of this be and should I even waste my time to them they don't care what the outcome is because what they wanted that moment is instantaneously need that they have to scratch it has happened\nSo when my fiance he goes to the grocery store suspend eight hundred bucks is I tell the story all the time she'll spend eight hundred bucks come home with enough food for a week now in her mind she's got enough food for four weeks right and she buys all this stuff she'll never cook and she freezes it\nBecause there's no way you do it goes bad so she doesn't freezes it goes bad and\nIf she freeze that we never read it because she never wants to take the time and take it out and thought because she's never think about what you do you need dinner when she gets up in the morning 'cause that's too far ahead for type rated thing she thinks what she wants instantly so we go out to eat [noise] eighty percent of the time\nSo we never use the ... it just goes bad spoils and then she secretly Throws Away she thinks I don't see are throwing it away all of a sudden it disappears and the money is wasted\nI beg her constantly when we go ... put it back you don't need it you're not going to use it and if I go with her to the grocery store we can get down to about four hundred dollars and still have exactly the same amount of food that we eat at home because we only eat certain meals at home and the rest of the time we go out now if I go by myself I'll get\nAll of them weeks where the food for two hundred dollars\nAnd have the same weeks where the food because I don't buy all the stuff she buys that we don't use inch in each interesting because it's just the way her brain works she can't help herself\nRight it's just ... ... it's a base assumption about wife if I Want something I should get it right now I needed a want it I'm an avid challenge with that is when you're that focused on the current moment in life\nYou have no time to think about where the future is going to be where am I going to be a month or male six months from now year from now five years from now ten years from now just no way of seeing that future at All right so they fail\nIn that manner they do it started thousand projects and finish none of them ever it's just the way they are they can't finish things up now\nYou can be a and you can be a be in different topics I didn't have to be in different topics some stuff on that day I just got to do it and I started out I go get all excited to get into it in the eye burned out\nI found out that I did it wrong I moved too quickly I didn't have enough base knowledge and boom there I was just like a talk about this train thing there I Am sitting the edge of this type a personality mistake going man I jumped into this for actually knew what I was supposed to do\nNow I've got to do something else and so I just go do something else well then I come back to the single I'm going to\nGet back and fix this problem that's the be kicking in the be saying you know what I got to get back on this and get it done and get it done right that's the be kicking she'll be has another kind of problem it's called analysis paralysis\nB will never take action there's two reasons B doesn't want to take action be sure you understand what they are number one is because if they take action they may make a mistake and bees do not like to be wrong\nI Will be at I Believe I've never been wrong one time I thought I was wrong but I found out I was wrong I was actually write bees will never admit that they're wrong they will fight you to death right that's just something to be you can't do second reason bees will not take action\nIs because it means they have to do something they're going to have to take action bees do not like to do things they rather sit and analyze things watch other people do things and criticized other people but they don't want to go do them\nBeach had their way they'd be wearing the same clothes they wore in high school eating the same food they when they were a kid [noise] nothing would ever change in their

had I don't know enough to\nProbably a last hour or so\nUpton I and I don't know enough to probably um\nLast hour or so and he sits there and and now I I run out and I'm scraping the pipe anybody that's on crack out there you're scraping the residue of the pipe and re smoking at and try and do it then you're looking on the ground all over the carpet trying to find pieces you dropped over the last few days and it's horrific and then uh\nAny way I look over and he's asleep and so I had on down to the streets only white guy now they're they're going you ain't got nothing for me you're not getting nothing for me and I mean all these things are saying I'm going how did they know what to me at all by buddy Joe there he just he goes goes make didn't realize we told them you know ... crazy white guy come down with the moustache\nSo Joe just do this story the other day and he 'cause he works\nAs a Christian I worked for my company I so anyway I get back to the wrong and I to feed it\nWhile that had to happen or I might still been there for years later [noise]\nBut it would take more than one incident certain really kick\nIn my living\nA real life\nUh my fifth year reunion with my class everyone's now is out of college\nThey get these amazing jobs they've started families are they've kept with the same company since high school ... in my mind they were way ahead of me and it was very it was\nBothering me inside and then it was just going wow everybody's ahead of me and I'm doing stop to show up and I mean I got into ... you know I was a card count and then I took some kind of class professional card but I hadn't even started it yet or whatever and destroyed the class so I'm\nI'm bragging at at the reunion about skydiving with a pair of shoes not opening and\nOn my car accidents or my card counter things that they've never seen or the mafia coming after me you know so I'm blowing their minds\nAnd so we don't get on the topic of uh yeah how are you doing for work how you do or not you know what are you doing Mike how many kids got home you know how your family you know I'm just completely\nPutting up to swallow the you know for these other things that are so they're all thinking I'm nuts basically but it was a very it was\nThat starting there was a very much a driver and it was like there was a lot of now it's starting to be a shame you know I'm going you know this is this is not who I can be done that I prayed I said you know God all I Want is to meet the right woman and have you know kids and and uh\nYou know be that the white picket fence so to speak and then got brought bad at all\nTo me and handed it to me on a silver platter\nUntil Mike jeopardized\nAnswered prayer\nBy then I was very functioning cocaine addict too I look back on it was perfect well no there was a lot of dysfunction even though the hard thing for the addiction to to hide it and all the time the kids didn't even know that that's good I Would assume it was a lot of work\nHiding the cocaine and then the Iraq the kittens didn't know okay even like neighbors let's give our kids are sitting there kids over there because we were the fun\nYou know this is back in the you know when they were younger and was cocaine but then when the crack came on that took us down fast when cocaine turned into ... and and the kids\nAnd my daughter at that time and when we got it right when it all kind of blew up she says we're very dysfunctional pay Michael I don't know what that means but don't ever say that again we're not dysfunctional such where where they may well I've been trying to just horrible I didn't know what it really really meant you know [laughter] so that don't sovereign\n[noise] but I lost it all\nIn all the chili last at all\n\nAnd in the midst of a lot of this to function Mike was all ready running my pillow\nI tried to repeal even when I was sixteen years old I bought one of my first paychecks when to buy a bill or at that grocery store I worked at\nThis teenager spent Seventy dollars on he that would be two hundred and eighty seven dollars in the day is money\nOr a law so I spent the most expensive pillow thinking it would be the ... it was a down below and it was the worst because you know\nI Know now they just sell us air I mean I I mean how can that be it feels good down and goes but I couldn't return or that I Do remember they would not let me return that pillow\nBut then through all my life I'm trying different pills and I always had problems with sleep and wake up in the morning a headache Nat King but mostly these sleep interruptions are not being able to get to sleep right away\nSo and in two thousand four I had a very clear dream of the name my pillow\nAnd I wrote my pillow all over the house in ... in connecting the wind in the pie and and you know these logos and I'm going\nThat sounds really corny but I go well where's my pillow you know I mean ... it's hard for you to think back now 'cause there's my everything and it was because of my pillow got big everybody took up the ... but my daughter came upstairs and there was she looked at their piece of paper written all over and\nLives he says she gets a glass Russia I don't know she's ... years old maybe she said what are you doing dad and I go\nHome and I met this pillow and I know it really is I hadn't even got the you know what what does he mean made over was going to do it's going to be the best thing ever I've seen it and and this is going to be called my pill and she looks\nIt never was going to do is going to be the best thing ever I've seen it in and this can be caught my pill and she looks at all these piece of paper she goes that's really random dad and she went back down stairs\nWell then the kids sit with their mother at the time\nWednesday I going to get over this pillow opinion and I said oh it's just a phase it'll be it'll be all real you know I was it\nAt that time it wasn't doing anything I'd stole my lower bar restaurant so my total focus was on this pill now well then I still had to figure out the material so we tried over Ninety four different kinds of phones and fails to put it in there and one Sunday or and I who's now managing\nEleven hundred twelve hundred employees of the manufacturing that's what he does now but he's like nine or ten years old and everyday ring up from school and then we tried different kinds of stuff on the deck in\nThe fall would fly all over the neighborhood and we tried little machines to get to work and finally we get it in a work once we had the pillows all made martyrs or house everything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nAnd I went into the first two I walked into a\nWas a bed bathroom beyond I'll just say the name in Bloomington, Minnesota I go in there I said I got the best pillow ever I said this pillows going to change you know change you're going to sell\nMore than anything and helps this helps you sleep blah blah blah and where where's your buyer who is your right where's the manager and he looks to me he goes you need to leave and I've gotten the guy just had all this passion you know and I'm going what do you mean I Need to leave I said I Want to talk to your body and I learned right away\nI started calling on other stores and everybody was the same shot out\nMy brother in law's brother ... why don't you do a kiosk and I said what's sad how do you spell kiosks\nAnd then we did this chaos and I had a little sign of ... where I put on a family owned and operated color in the stencil\nAnd the other one I put a chiropractor recommended and she goes his then wife\nWe can't have this she goes someone can sue us I said I gave one to a chiropractor our friend you know and and he loves it you know but it was way far you know here's a mall and here's this in a mall just was almost too corny and I mean almost to real but I did we did sell about eighty pillows\nAnd the one day\nObviously we lost up I don't know like Fifteen thousand dollars 'cause it's very expensive to have a key us in a November and December and one guy he came up and he said hey you ever do you have a card and I go\nOut of business cards that I go oh I'm all out I sit here and I gave my number and in January of that year not ... almost complete failure basically\nI borrow money from my ex book either by Christmas presents a here by the way the reason he was my ex book he said if you quit gambling borrow your money I mean I I mean that's a you know he cared a\nSaw this guy called me in January and he says are you the guy that have been in this pill or the one guy gave my phone number two and I go yeah and he goes to his color change my life\nHe says it is a miracle and he was all about that I'm going okay and the wrong side of the hearing his you know not worry about where I Am at that this is I'm going I was just so happy for him that it helped him and he goes\nI run the Minneapolis Garton show would you like a spot in there and I go and I and I'm thinking to myself right away while the kiosk and work and I'm going to go well maybe there's more people\nAre some you know and I'm sure if I didn't have money you know and I had to borrow money to get into their [noise] but then I'm going to that home and garden a showman but what I did is I got mine that food I could sell and\nOnce I got behind it was like\nWow you know I'm seeing people they were literally come back the next day\nSo many people after that first thing is is a miracle and same thing that guys now I'm feeding off this passion and I'm just it was amazing where that I realized I could sell\nAnd I could sell and help people and I sold out that in four days sold out and I was ... and I'm going why this is where

best selling author these claim to fame is doing things like covering three hundred and fifty miles\nIn eighty hours and forty four minutes of sleepless running for traveling to the states in the days and running a marathon teach them most days and you know those\nTwo hundred mile relay races the teams of twelve take on well this guy who runs those solo dean has also written multiple books including ultra marathon man confessions of an all night runner and his latest the road to Sparta\nReliving the ancient battle an effort run that inspired the world's greatest foot race and dean thanks so much for joining us\nJust listening to it\nI think I Need to take a run [laughter] oh dear yeah I don't have a beer Enron here\nBefore we get into your running another accomplishments we love to talk to almost everybody who walks through the store for all of our interview process where were you born tell us about your parents and one of the things in childhood that using shake you to become the guy you are today\nI was born in Los Angeles so California born and raised a I'm a hundred percent Greeks I'm from a guy great grandparents\nUm [noise] I remember running a home from kindergarten when I was six years old I was the oldest child and when we had my my youngest sister I said we've got a I've got a brother who's a little bit younger than me and my sister I remember my mom is having a hard time getting me home from school\nAnd my dad was working two jobs so I just said mom you don't have to worry about getting me home and she said well how are you going to get home\nAnd I said well I'm going to run home\nAnd I remember really enjoying running I remember sitting in the classroom or just waiting for the ... you know what young kid especially a boy wants to sit still and pay attention I mean a young boy he wants to run around and go wild\nAnd I remember sitting there in that classroom to ... you know counting down the moment to tell the bell rang and then running home\n... and I still don't want us to do and pay attention\nSo you know that's all right yeah\nAnd so tell me this you you you then start to I guess do it all boys do which is increased the challenge just step it up a little bit more talk about how that happened increasing your distances as a kid\nWell there's this idea of never stop exploring and in running it's very symbolic you know Iran I ran a marathon when I was fourteen years old so that you know twenty six point two miles\nAnd I thought maybe the further than anyone could ever run a and then I heard about people running further than that and I I couldn't believe it I heard about a fifty mile race\nAnd I thought that the possible a human being can't run continuously for fifty miles I got to try it [laughter]\nSo I signed up in Iran fifty miles and you know at the fifty mile race he said well congratulations you qualified and I'm thinking qualified for what for the insane asylum and they said no you qualified for the western states one hundred mile endurance run\nAnd I could not wrap my head around the idea of someone running a hundred miles non stop I thought you know there's gotta be campsites along the way you know how many days of the tank and they said no the starting gun goes off and you run as though you're running you know a mile race around that\nOr they were very independent um almost separate nations of a sort but they all polluted and all kind of use best practices or to better themselves and I think the Greeks\nYou know the Greeks have said we can't turn it anywhere else I mean we're kind of we we've got to help ourselves they've been very self reliant is is one quality that I've seen with Greeks\nAnd um you know we're we're a definitely a minority I think that a Greek Americans make up um something less than half a percent of the U.S population but I'm per capita there are more Greek PHD's than any other class\nAnd its millionaires is while there are more Greek millionaires than any other ethnic group and this is again per capita two hundred small small base of people yeah\nYeah and I'm Lebanese and we're a little behind the greed spent years a group of people that come into this country\nAnd I got to tell you do not many made fun of a lot it didn't bother me because my parents said don't worry about it you know for every person to make money and there's ten people who love you and I found that to to do that to the nature of the American experiment and the American people there really generous they wanted to try out my foods family food\nAnd they were deeply curious in that one no go ahead and the crowd he just had to learn to ignore them and get on with the rest of your life\n[laughter] and then\nI've got a Lebanese friends I Know where you're talking about there if there wasn't that funny people really great\nPeople always just say let's turn something really ugly and something funny if we get like short so let's talk back to that since the marathons and sixty days and they just said you you start in St Louis in September Seventy two thousand six\nWith Lewis and Clark marathon you ended on November ... two thousand six with the New York city marathon talked about some highlights some low light to dean deserve got to be moments even inside you are you going what was I thinking\n[laughter] plenty of those moments of but it was great exploration I mean it was ah for for one you know just for the listeners to explain how I did this I had a big school bus\nAnd my mom is a retired public school teacher so I brought my kids along to my daughter and my son they were young at that point\nAnd my mom would wrote school them so she'd basically home school them as we're driving around the country for fifty days there are schools were sending them the lesson plans emailing them to my mom every Sunday night and she teach a lesson throughout the week\nAnd we all of a sudden became like that I kind of this traveling um road show where all of my kids' friends from school or so curious you know what were the experiences they were having a and then their parents learned about it so now their parents were falling out\nAnd people started learning about what I was doing and they were coming out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line about race in Iowa on Tuesday Morning\nSprint and yeah no and marathon for flying from Alaska guy came in from Japan to run with me they heard about this\nAnd it just sort of like this Brotherhood they can't sister that they came together\nAfter that was you know the ... that really a poignant and beautiful moments and some of the low moments where I remember running a marathon in Alaska and it was snowing and cold and the next day I was in Arizona and it was about a hundred and five degrees running through the desert\nAnd I remember finishing the re thinking\nThis is marathon Nineteen I can barely walk you know how many had to get out of bed to all morning and run a marathon let alone you know thirty more after that\nSo there were some moments where I really doubt it I could do it um and just you know kept that American Spirit to said you know when I get out of bed in the morning I Would say I don't think about running a marathon just get to the think you know the bathroom and spice of water in your face\nYou know okay that's great to just put on your shorts you know one leg at a time okay lace up your shoes okay get out the door [laughter] get to the starting line okay to start running just put one foot in front of the other uh became at point the very cerebral challenges for the physical one\nYeah I Would assume that you know I I've gotten into my ... life and he has this thing for all the young guys on the court and it's not\nAnything else please do simple words next to play\nNot to play before and not to replace five plays the next game or the NCAA finals just next play and so many kids and and and the athletes who played under his to ... talk about how that helped him focus\nOn just the next activity in front of you slice didn't become as intimidating that way\nAnd it's ... you're right I'm with running you know it gets very grand why they said yeah instead of mixed play its next step your next step\nNext step because you tend to look at the market especially during the marathon you know you might be a mile and you might see market says my Eighteen\nWhich means you know you basically have over eight miles to go and you know you might be cramping at that point you know you might just be completely exhausted it's demoralizing at the heavy weight and your shoulders to think how am I going to run another eight miles on top of what I die and\nDon't do that I just said next step put the blinders on about the future don't reflect in the past just being the present moment\nPut the blinders on about the future don't reflect on the path to be in the present moment in that now next step next step I really I can relate to that next play mentality\nYeah and it's a great thing for a wife I think tend to stay in the moment and not get overwhelmed by the ... season life which can easily overwhelm any of us if we look too far down the road or too far back\nInto the past it can be paralyzing let's talk about was cross country road trip because my goodness we talked to one person who's biked across the country\nFor Dave Dave Thomas is foundation he's a Wendy's franchisee who said my goodness I Want to raise the money for kids\nAnd so he he ... he wrote across the country on a bicycle and we followed them along what was jogging across the country like and by the way what did you learn about your country when you did this and that fifty day in fifty state or adventure and what's your family learn\nYou know I'd I learned or we're a very diverse country I mean you you hear that set all the time and it's almost cliche but the regional differences I'm not just with the food and you know the dialect\nBut with philosophy and the way you approach to life is so varied as you run across the country\nBut the one the one you know the the one uniting thing if it were all free and we're all freedom loving people\nSo that support I got along the way was remarkable it's almost like Forrest Gump I mean some day that'd be running and they'd be forty or fifty people running with me you don't ever mode highway [laughter] out in the in the desert I remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm and people showing up on the side of the road with hot chocolate\nSo we you know I I learned that running can transcend our differences and bring people together I mean there's so many things in this world that that divide us right be it you know political beliefs to Carver scan the God we worship whatever\nI when I was out there running a and people were running with me it's a commonality all of the human share and it brought us together regardless of you know the food we ate um you know the accent we had to ah it was really beautiful thing that the support of the people that came out I'm not talking about elite runners some elite runners but\nSome people just coming out to run a mile or two by my side\nYep then by the way what's so interesting to me on a dear friend of mine just to tell you a guy who was one of my mentors and he said you know if you can do these three things a lot you're going to have a happy life play sports a lot because you're not talking dance a lot 'cause you're not talking\nAnd and last but not least and this was just you love a lot 'cause then you're not talking [laughter] and I love and you're not in\nThe latter yeah I think I'll do the ladder to when we come back and I think that's what's transcendental is you're running what people you're not going to get them into an argument you're running together you might chat a little bit but there's something about just running together just throwing a ball with your kid you don't have to talk for the ball it just the movements\nOf the movement back just a beautiful thing as the ... when we come back more with ultra marathon man dean Cornell says this is our American stories and by the

original marathon and the ... the Greek runner feeding pd surfer deputies that ran the marathon\nAnd uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so\nUh you know ironically right now the book is it's the number one on Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I doubt very deeply into the history of of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and I also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked\nI also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from so I actually went back degrees to the very village my grandfather came from and his grandfather and his grandfather before him\nAnd discovered a lot about you know why I'm all about and how I became who I Am and where my people came from\nAnd that to me it was fascinating I think that's something that that you know we look at the the popularity of things like ancestry dot com or twenty three I mean you know the genetic ethic and tell you where your ancestors came from ballet did I learn where my ancestors came from I visited these places\nAnd ... how they live you know generations ago and that was really fast and they had to write about all this in the book\nYou know there's one point in time where you say at the START I was surrounded by three hundred and fifty warriors huddled in the pre dawn missed at the foot of the crop a list of Athens for me the quest was deeply personal I'd been waiting a lifetime to be standing in this place I Would finally run alongside my ancient brother\nClose out with us those words who was an ancient brother you just mentioned them and that feeling running and starting to run by the crop all this\nIs your brother was his name was the deputy and he was part of a class of people called him over there on me they were professional day long runners they were foot Harold foot messengers and his mission was ... when the Persian invaded Greece at the bad marathon\nThe Athenians said we need to recruit the Spartans to help us we need reinforcements were badly out numbered they dispatched to this man but it but he used to run a hundred and fifty three miles\nNonstop to Sparta to recruit the Spartans\nThe battle and it was because it hit her really undertaking and his mission\nThat democracy is what it is today I mean he basically saved democracy Greece was the first\nDemocratic state and the Persians won the crush of them had he not succeeded in running a hundred and fifty three miles to recruit this bar in our life we very much different and to me that it was incredible to retrace his footsteps and they do it and um my cell and twenty five hundred years later\nAnd that's we love
