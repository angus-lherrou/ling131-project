outrageous and that is you know I didn't want to listen Josh during the twenty sixteen campaign about the polls because I didn't want it because I because I thought by the way she was going to wind and solar out in the last five days or so I thought that's when the weight and but\nI I saw the race than I had all their data and it seemed to me that they were off a pointer to naturally made giving Hillary Clinton more return asked\nBy on these polls I Would say right now it is six and a half\nAnd barely six and a half trending down if the race if it keeps going the way it's going I think we're going to be sitting under six points nationally and Republicans will\nAccording to you John Doe people their seats in Virginia I'm telling you they're going to keep all nine house seats in New York I'm calling you from New York City I think that you will lose only one or two in New Jersey\nBut here's the ... but here's the thing the prize is for what I'm hearing we're going to keep bringing Lloyd he's all our seats in California but for the Daryl I used to see what she's leaving that he barely won last time\nMeaning that that would be let's say between Virginia California New York and

right way to do with\nThe sun Ronnie is David these networks they don't spend the money they have to spend Fifteen people doing jobs that one person can do right right some of the ... and things like that you would think they actually would want to spend money on real poll but they\nLet me shipped over to some policy and I want to get your thoughts Mike Pompeo justice match to Saudi Arabia to a ... by the president\nWho spoke with Mohammed bin Salman ... today king Salman denying it anything to do was to show he that's hard to believe for the average person but he was denying it up to I guess that then the Princeton turning around and telling pump able to go there\nThe president saying on Saturday he was that if it was proven that he was murdered in the conflict there would be severe punishment for the Saudis the Saudis then\nTurned around under M. B. and B. S. and said we will retaliate\nWhat do you make this whole thing Sam\n... well I think retaliated and that's ridiculous on the retaliating common coming from Saudi Arabia was on state run TV it was probably someone the equivalent of like a a you know the equivalent of a a radio host saying something right for you know so\nLet's take that and there's always the Saudis they fix it will retaliate and they'll go to and they'll start aligning themselves with Russia you want to align ourselves to Russia um you want to lie on your cells are are so you'll end up in the Shia\nThe Iranian crafts and so that's not realistic would I think is is the following this reporter was killed by the Saudi Arabians not only was he kills people's apparently\nA killed in eight barbaric\nBarbaric manner\nUm it was something that went wrong\nI don't know why this gentleman ... that was a obviously he's not responsible for what happened but considering what I'm considering the pieces he was writing knowing about MVSA ... empty as he Donald Trump is correct about M. B. S. for the following reason\nRemember George W. Bush took us into Iraq not only find you want to remove Saddam but then he said we're going to have them vote is not going to select a democracy and\nIt's going to end up having Starbucks there and movie theater okay that's the way it worked out I had no problem with us in in these regents supporting monsters there are monsters but they are are monsters\nThey need to realize that they can act like monsters in ... in your own fiefdom we're not going to judge them on what you can't do that to American right vantage an American citizen that American residents there um I Do think that the ... should go to Saudi Arabia agreed\nHas to be some kind of consequences for that and and and I will say\nAgreed to meet them kind of consequences for that and and and I will say from a selfish point of view one the president has done the right thing by sending them pay their number two\nWe can't let this be the Democrats October surprise I'm going to tell you something the election may not be nice to say that it is what it is I faced a lot politically correct so\nI just think we need to handle it I also agree though I'm leaving there is there is no reason why we should not Sheldon farms that can be used against Iranian and or Iranian proxies otherwise says the Chinese will sell them to them so\nThat's what I got to where we are and I think the president just said to handle this um if I were in the I I Would stop issuing these denials\nBecause I I mean another piece of news I mean he was they had everything from a man's apple wash right now I mean I were an apple watch that we know that even when you wear your apple watches\nA a you know the government are talking about turkey and get all your audio so he clearly clearly from all public reporting murdered sky\nI ... I don't care if this journalist or Muslim Brotherhood I don't care who is allies for I don't care what bin Laden\nIt's relevant and he cannot conduct himself if he wants to be a western society ... chatty rabies modernizing frankly NBS one Saudi Arabia to modernize economically young so he can stay in power the same way\nThat Trump is trying to deal with Kim Jong il gave up new can joke about power right right\nI think there has to be some consequences for that the president I think will announce them\nSam where in complete agreement great analysis thanks for being with us Sam Nunberg\nHolding on every shaded Sam with Steve Bannon's political action committee citizens for the American republic cars the acronym citizens for the American public you can find that on the Web Sam thanks for being with us joining us now several Gorka he was a senior advisor to\nPresident Trump in the White House he was also a a very senior member of the campaign is now the author of a new must read book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies in fact he's got a book party tonight\nCase ebb great to have you back here and the John drugs radio network\nGreat to be back with Godzilla\nThank you said let's get to the Saudi Arabians situation sep not too good first they say well Jamal came out\nThen they say you didn't come on it's like the Roach Motel you go into the Saudi constantly than this damn bowl but you know come out now they say well maybe it was rogue murder that he went in for interrogation but there's no official statement\nComing from king Salman who denies the whole thing and now the Saudis threatening other there was any sanctions or they're going to retaliate and disrupt the world's economy and shoot up oil prices ... what the hell is going on here\nWell ah this individual who's not a judge lifted opinion piece friday's loaded American he was the original alien he's been caught up in the middle of a geopolitical competition\nBetween two Sunni nations who want to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that turkey which is becoming a new ought to him and his feel go see on the\n... and Saudi Arabia where Islam was founded in the seventh century of of this person was recorded in the middle of an individual who who if the reports all true about what happened to them didn't deserve what happened to him\nWas a very very shady character with a very close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood even to the bin Laden family I'm an individual who was the nephew of the biggest problems due to the twentieth century ... so it's it's basically an individual caught in the middle of a giant geo strategic competition\nSo the president's sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Riyadh to try to get to the bottom of this find out what happened obviously the Saudis the first day when they put out which was that this individual was there an hour got his paperwork and\nDeparted but they said the dog ate the cameras or something they couldn't produce the footage of that now they're changing\nTheir story how does this affect the U.S relationship with the Saudis as it relates to Mohammed bin Salman\nWell when we were in the White House uh we were very encouraged by the reforms NBS was initiating we we always used the term behavior modification Saudi Arabia had\nBeen in bed with the wrong people for far too long of key members of the elite had been funding and supporting a jihadi out the audio ... how the activists\nAround the world that was going on a very very positive Paul this is not what we expect from a nation that says it's recalling itself so Mike Pompeo is a tough guy I talked with a couple of his closet Westport over director who CIA\nHe will get to the bottom of it and if the reports turned out to be true about what happened to ... that will be a consequences for Saudi Arabia definitely the ... the arms trade or if my expectation\nTo think that this might affect the United states backing of the Saudi Emirates coalition and the Yemeni civil war said\nYes oh so the the big Big M muscle move but right now in the region is when we were in the beginning of the administration\nBut gee Sisi the Gulf Cooperation council turned its back on ... which is the worst offenders in the region when it comes to sponsoring radical Islamic groups that that's going to be the primary concern that we we we maintain pressure on ... and the G C C continues to\nTo behave in ways that that will lessen the impact will the importance of these radical groups on top of that ... that the ... the second of the ... uh uh order effects most important of all being Iran so you know that there is a balance in the region but\nThe instability in Lebanon and other major issues and\nSo this actually has the feeling of a potentially a watershed time in the relationship\nI think you're right and there's other issues as well the consolidation of power by\nNBS Mohammed bin Salman arresting all of what you might consider his potential rivals calling it corruption putting them in a hotel the administration look the other way on that I kind of got it their business or write the kind of went with it\nBut then you've also got the blonde Gulf\nBlood K they did against Qatar which really made no sense and it's because it's backfired on them because the nation of cutter is now better off than they were so that's backfired and blow up in their face now they're trying to\n... as you know ... you know there's challenges with cutter but has also the\nThe home of a major us air base of the all you need air force base in subtle rent and not have been able to prosecute the war against ISIS without being able to use that base a base on two occasions one so the the glass of nature of Saudi Arabia toilets auto a\nProsecution of a humanitarian disaster by most accounts in Yemen and these other instances and you know I think for a long time hey let's be blunt the basis of their relationship was that the United states needed right\nOff from Saudi Arabia that's less less the case in the United states now becomes a lot of energy ... for a job up our own energy sources\nAre in our need to rely on oil from Saudi Arabia and current are had the other direction on human rights issues on equal status of women a prosecution of political decisions dissidents et cetera and we don't have to turn our had any longer\nAnd I think now that and I tell you what I don't want this to become on how we navigate their way through it but as you know I'm In non intervention list and I'm a victim and Lee opposed to the\nOur involvement in supporting the Saudi Emirates\nCoalition and voting the civil war against the Yemen he's fifty thousand people dead people are starving children eating bark off trees I mean the thing is horrific\nWe've got the whole buses getting blown up with bombs and made in the u._s._a. I mean the whole thing is a disaster we shouldn't be there bomber got us in the president who as you know I'm a big supporter of campaign to get us out we're not out\nBut the other day this is interesting and I I just want your comment on this one of the strangest alliances of all time your colleague Lindsey Graham wants a muscular national response to everything as you know part of the new concept aligning himself with\nRand Paul the non interventionist in getting out of this war and Rand Paul saying he's going to bring it to a vote on the Senate floor how would that work and when would that be\n[noise] um we we are I'm John we're out and tell Veterans Day we'll be back in the day after Veterans Day and I think you're going to see a lame duck session like no other I think it can be extremely intense in November and December\nThere there are different ways is can come up for a vote 'em\nIn the Senate you know you one senator can sort of stop action on virtually anything until you get your way on something else so I think the two issues you'll see come up and you are right to point out when Lindsey Graham who's an interventionist says it's time for us to get out\nThat really tells you something about Rand has Rand Paul and I and Chris Murphy and others have been in the in the position of trying to block arms sales to stop activity in Yemen for a while but with Lindsay and others coming on board it does show that changed in a relationship so I think you'll see\nA for a vote on the Senate on one of two and maybe both you may see a floor vote on\nOn blocking arms sales and you may also see a floor vote on a stopping\nAny us support for the war in Yemen we were in Yemen battling ISIS and al ... there is an ISIS and al ... presidents of Yemen that then separate to that the civil war between the who sees and the Yemeni government started\nAnd us activity has sort of bled over from the battle against ISIS Zapata\nInto active participation on behalf of the Saudis and the civil war and I think it's time that we that we stopped at\nA let's move on Senator Tim Kaine with us here on the John ... radio network and he's running for election to a second term that will be decided on November sixes Republican opponent is Prince William county chairman of the board of supervisors Corey Stewart\nCenter the Honduras Guatemala caravan now up to four thousand people\nTraveling to the United states there want to come to the country illegally\nThese are not refugees for filing they're calling themselves economic refugees will senator there's four billion people around the globe that could be economic refugees that could find a better life in the United states\nAre you in favor of just four or five thousand people just walking over the border in this caravan and being absorbed into the U.S and if we do that what's to say the next one isn't going to be forty thousand or fifty thousand\nYeah no you know you're right John ... that we we have to have laws about who gets in and who doesn't and we have to have border security I have voted\nFor repeatedly has you know I was part of that group in the Senate in April I'm Sorry junior twenty Thirteen that passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill and in that bill folks often don't pay attention is in that bill\nWas forty billion dollars of border security over ten years President Trump is now asking for twenty five billion dollars in border security\nOver ten years or less than we originally included in the bill that we did\nWe we need comprehensive immigration reform or where I I mean I Am not for open borders and never have been we make we need to make sure we invest the um uh the money in the right way so uh when I worked I actually worked with Lindsey Graham in February we put it\nThe right way so when I worked for I actually worked with Lindsey Graham in February we put a deal on the table for the president that the deal was Mr President can you take yes for an answer\nThat deal involved protection for dreamers which the president had said Congress should do banned it involved the complete twenty five billion dollars\nThat the president had asked for over ten years with\nCongressional oversight to make sure it was spent right um but the president when we put the deal\nOut their trashed we at eight Democrats and Republicans the president could have accomplished something that he said that he would do when he ran for office and he chose to attack it because he wants to dramatically change family unification and the diversity visa program\nEt cetera but with respect to the care of and shouldn't be able to just\nCome in their state from Honduras from from Denmark or from anywhere there there have to be rules and they the rules and to be enforced and that's why it's time that we do a comprehensive immigration reform\nWell I think the president is open to Dr negotiation I mean I think he does realize that these are children in the United states they know they know no other place I think the real negotiating issue now becomes the president is adamantly opposed to the continuation of chain migration\nAnd he would prefer a um merit based economic system\nOf immigration like Canada or or stroll you has it basically says if we have a need for pipe sitters and there's ... in Somalia they go to the top of the line because if they immigrate to the United states are going to find a job so that's the issue that's going to have to get worked out as you guys go forward with this but and and\nJohn there may be a discussion I mean in\nThe lame duck I was talking about that earlier how many issues that are after um as you know we we avoid a government shutdown at such a phony and appropriations go I'm most of the major categories of government before the end of September that was good that the one\nI'm item we just did a continuing resolution to early December for continued discussion is on the border funding area so yeah we're going to have all between the\nElection in early December will have a major discussion with the polls and about that and he wants to border security money which we've been willing to vote for and we want reforms as well\nI'm ... and we'll we'll\nWe'll get into office cashing in the next month or so\nAs this caravan get through Mexico and gets to the southern border of the United states senator Kaine what should authorities do what should we do\nWell well first I mean let's let's not wait I'm getting to the watchers or not to the bottom allowing Mexican border yet so we need to work with a\nGovernment some Guatemala and Mexico I'm On this and you know I Hope that the president's especially you know often tough talk about Mexico et cetera does not hurt our ability to\nReach and a quarter was ... I think one\nOf the issues that's important is you gotta have allies in the world and and when you have allies you can work together on joint solution is the best thing is for the caravan of people in Honduras or or not even get to the border with the United states but that would involve the U.S having a cooperative relationship\nWith Mexico for example and not spending time trashing Mexico which the president an awesome does so I Know that a U.S military and north command which basically is everything north of the Mexican Guatemalan border\nWhere you were already\nAm six hundred WB you'll be

was there or not where was she and that was my big concern I wasn't so much that she cut gym it's that for a flash I didn't know where she was then I Need your advice as to what I should say to
