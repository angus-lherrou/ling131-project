medium six on the one on one point I Want to do\nOrder to believe Dr Ford you have to suspend [noise]\nYour ability to reason given three different answers as to when the assault happened mid eighties early eighties and all of a sudden actually was the summer in Nineteen eighty two after she lawyers up\nYou have to believe that she waited waited\nReally until now to reveal that the individual who assaulted her was in fact judge Kavanaugh never said anything to anybody else although her husband now has circled back and said oh I remember her telling me doing marriage therapy okay we'd like to see the notes they won't return they won't released enough so that just not believable\n\nShe can't remember the details about the night who invited her to the party how she heard about the party and how she got to the party how she left the party where the houses exactly with any specificity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she\nTraveled back home when she got back home\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by single person including none of the people she's named including as well her lifelong girlfriend Leland Kaiser but apparently it's not change based on reports today she hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions are therapists notes to the report and others in July the\nWhole copy the therapists notes read from the therapists no she doesn't remember she can't remember ever she had an actual copy the therapists knows when she called the Washington Post or she had gone to her therapist's office and read the ... I Can't remember any of that\nShe won't provide\nFirst and read the notes can't remember any of that she won't provide the notes to the committee\n\nShe won't provided to the committee she can't remember the day that she had the polygraph this was very reason this what a month six weeks eight weeks ago whether it was on the day her grandmother passed away or not she can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\nIf in fact she was traumatized during the course of the issues may lie detector tests did she claims\n\nShe talks about the psychological impact that had that she doesn't want to fly she was difficulty flying now we know that was a flight out lie and say that yes a flat out why she's flown west coast east coast east coast the west coast she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica all over the world\nBut when she was asked to shop for a hearing she couldn't fly\nAlthough it has said that she was already on the east coast [noise] she didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California to interview her in any form\nAnd uh\nWhy didn't you know people say her lawyers must have withheld that information maybe the large didn't withhold the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright answer\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and the few years before that that the day that we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment that was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kevin O's named her her boyfriend her living boyfriend have six years\nSo you have to believe the unbelievable to believe\nHer testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must suspend your reasoning and now that I've gone all through that she's not the bubble lady\nShe came for she said it was a civic duty she's presented herself to the American people and we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor you have to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that and we're not doing that\nNow what if Kavanaugh say that was so unbelievable or contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have had more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\n\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nBut you see the FBI didn't interview him or Ford now according to Ford's lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are on in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play foot see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles with the Democrats say enough already and missed a flight and ms Collins and ms Murkowski the one that's wrong with the Democrats go ahead we're having a vote this is over\nWe're not going to participate in any further sham we're not going to participate now and the trashing the FBI I'm not talking about the senior people at the FBI now they're trashing the FBI if there lecturing us for Eighteen months about the FBI\nThat's not the senior officials in the FBI who are doing these interviews these are special agents I have no doubt the hard working men and women are the FBI that the Democrats claimed alike but they have all law enforcement let's be honest\nSo enough so now we don't need to deal honestly we don't need to deal with people\nWho are diabolical diabolical\nThat includes like that includes Collins that includes Murkowski who brought us to this point I guarantee you\n\nIf it were their husbands are flights wives who are being treated this way they wouldn't agree you know what maybe we should extend as far as I wake\nWhy\nWhat took place this weekend endless speculation endless analysis of what\n\nThe insanity is ubiquitous\nIt's all over the media all over the media I'll get to them later as I always do such I actually believe Dr Ford Israeli to suspend the ability to use your brain\nAs applies to Brett

Vermont and just\nBy a guilt by association they are Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats tried to tried to take my dad my family down but unfortunately or fortunately excuse me after eight years or putting them severely financially I'm dead or my parents were able to weather the storm and and come out victorious\nWhether charges brought against them\nNot a single indictment there were eight years of investigation or put them a million dollars to spend the million dollars just defending themselves like yeah\nCan you imagine folks being investigated for eight years\nEight years that the FBI they'll have returned some of the personal effects\nAre they took from my family so that whole cabinet that tuition very much at home to me because I Believe they've tried to do the same thing to this good man at the time that my father the good news is my dad weather the storm even though my parents were ruined financially they didn't fold under the pressure to admit that they didn't do and thankfully neither is Kevin\nOr the real reason I'm calling because I never third one bit about politics I certainly never considered myself a conservative but the aftermath of the two thousand and six in a lecture and that changed everything for me I\nBelieve it or not I was planning on voting for Hillary I Know that sounds crazy but I I was facing that decision purely on how I Believe\nShe presented herself on TV during a three televised debates I thought that she representatives though more presidential ie but that stupid that down I'm sure there's a lot of other people who did the same thing a Democrats are very good at looking polish on television they have a great outer shell with no substance underneath\nA but it was it was after the election right started to realize how crooked one side of the media was\nAnd it was started the wheel turning in my head\nUm then seeing all the venom attack by liberal on social media to force myself and others are for daring to have a different opinion which that but really energized me to get in the fight\n'em I'm now a third of Republican through and through\nAnd I absolutely be voting Republican in the upcoming elections I've got to imagine there there's other people more like me out there people who didn't care much about politics before the election of people are starting to have their eyes open to what is happening in our our all ready to get into the fight at this point I really believe this fight\nA fight Britain good versus evil you know Republican to stand for freedom and the constitution\nVersus Democrats represent hate and\nAre working hard to take away our individual God given liberties\nNow only friend while I think you're exactly right and my best to your family I'm Sorry you had to go through that you take care of yourself [noise] M. J. Fort Lauderdale Florida Sirius satellite go right ahead please\nHigh and then how you doing this evening great thank you fight for like you know first and foremost on my side and I just turned fourteen just finished reading liberty and tyranny\nAnd ... and he is working on a cinematic healthy yeah there is a tough book ... proudly now he's ... we've been cutting the training trading that trough crowd haven't broken writing a report on it\nUm but I um I listen I just wanted I Love your show on Sundays on her ... and I'm just wanted to say thanks for everything you do I had a bad heart but you you keep the company oh my goodness\nAnd looking for the stuff coming out my husband's a cop so am I Can't wait to this\nAnd so looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so am I Can't wait to this particular that's great I wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know with the left loving women and supporting women and all that good\nStuff and I don't think I'm Dr for its lawyers really care about her care about women because I thought um I just kind of thought with general I'm a former marine so I just got along with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not shore\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble garage sale and I thought but Martha Stewart maybe not inside of training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for may lying to the FBI [noise]\nUm if if the left cared about her including the Democrats in all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabin I investigation why would they want the FBI to ask one question\nThe FBI ask one question just something like hey do you fly on airplanes she's done she's only jail\nBut none of them but here's here's the thing for the FBI right now I agree\nWith you but they're not doing a criminal investigation\nBut this is what judge Apollo tunnel doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know plead the fifth and that sort of saying what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various obligations that were made and that's it\nRight now the thing I thought in your title Eighteen [noise]\nWhat title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section a thousand and one false statements yeah [noise]\nYeah I mean that's ... that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth [noise] they're doing a criminal investigation they would have to be issuing letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nUh then they're going through now if they want to do search they get warrants probable cause it's none of that like\nOnly understand that that's what they want because obviously they wanted rats would watch the term [noise] they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course the on not to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want but they don't want this they don't have an hour which I'm so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for them to get the drag this out\nNow that the the the way as if you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jay do get your point I Hope you feel well a given your week hard I Know the feeling I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer ... to\nMarch first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner in crime or Sean Hannity I don't know what we would do without you\nKnow you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up and maybe I Need a little more and more understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford or why not for the sake of appearing cancer\nAnd she was not about appearances they had a limited amount of time listen the parents is not is not going to assuage the left it's just not\nAnd so we on the right we have to start to understand this or we constitutional is it's not about I'm a pass to find the media pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in yes\nAnd so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThis these are the same people who said the man is guilty of a job interview and that he ... and the and the the er\nThe due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better at the FBI interview the two others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\nThat's what we're up against wherever against truly diabolical individuals so you're not going to be able to tease them under any circumstances probably right\nBy\nHere's the truth about most home security companies they're like dealing with another bad cable company you spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when you're at your limit you remember you know I'm locked into a three year contract\nIf you're looking to protect your home and family go was simply safe home security simply savers real comprehension protection beautifully designed to look good in your home simply safe as backups\nIn place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power or Internet where if someone attacks the system and best of all you got twenty four seven monitoring what police and fire dispatch for judge Fifteen dollars a month and unlike other home security companies simply said has\nNo long term contracts it is the best around the clock protection you can find get ten percent off simply said today that simply safe mark dot\nAnd none of these guys ever came out and apologize and they had expert after expert on TV telling us how you look at these facial expressions of the president hey look at the way he ... his words\nLike the way he carries himself this guy's got problems right here we are to your later I'll tell you that this guy is a rock star and a genius and and is is bearing these guys which is very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then they carry for who he carries force that doctor that he\nThat that was the one that did all this uh investigation on itself has tried to force trying to go through all the medical hoops\nAnd from that and this guy gets left and carnage as well because he came out said that he was very sounded very healthy right right and what I Would have bought show just says it's maddening as you as your conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that were working with nobody ever came I Apologize for\nFor saying that Trump was the manager or has all that crazy fiction\nRight they're never going to apologize for it because they never well this is a hit and run bunch and hit and run budge now they got this tax returns or from two thousand two thousand one his father's taxes somehow they stole loews or somebody stole them and\nUh the ACLU isn't around to help the ACLU is thrown in with the uh\nThe tyrants All right my friend thank you for your call\nLet us continue\nTo see here ah let us go to Ken Long Beach California eight Seventy the answer go\nYes mark I my question is are there any or a Senate precedents or any rules of the Senate would allow I'm Dianne Feinstein to be declared a two week we choose for self for many vote\nBecause of the alleged involvement\nWith no they would have to have a financial interest or family member I have a financial interest something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth you know first of all you'd have to prove it so far they haven't proven and although we all know sheer somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so it'd be a sideshow\nAnd uh my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with fame Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for him in ... when I was already four person sorry\nWell if they vote for the for that means the holding in the circuit court below stands\nOkay and and there's there's there's no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court now there could be is that what I mean that would\nBe it could have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it oh you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their side\nWe need to listen and we need to we need we need to stop acting like losers and be on the defense here we need to ram this through no worry about recess appointments and recusal and all the rest [noise] these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges are you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing in the case of ... Collins that you are you take this very very seriously\n[noise] All right my friend thanks for your call Frank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H. T. go\nHi Mark thanks for taking my call for me I'm I'm very concerned that I don't think so\nI understand the impact that this Kavanaugh hearing it's having on due process in this country and and and ... should be we should be out great because of your your process is gone then the country's gone you have somebody who who accused\nJudge Kavanaugh all of a crime and rather than the burden of proof being on the accuser which is due process the burden of proof is on the accused and not only that but now the accuser gets to determine what is\nJustified proof he has a calendar well that's not good enough all the witnesses say that that he didn't do it or he wasn't there that's not good enough we need an FBI investigation that's not good enough and then he's not even allowed to point to the inconsistencies up the accuser\nFord and all the lie that no no no you're not allowed to talk to her she's she's the victim mark if I can just go around accusing people you know mark you have women while I have a daughter yeah but that's not good enough well but I work with yeah but that's not and now it's up to you to prove to me that you don't\nDo processes done and and I don't know ... I mean I Want to have it ought to be voted but this is so much bigger than justice Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court this is the country and I don't feel that folks really understand the impact\nI think a lot too I really do maybe not enough that I think there's a rising tide here and you put it very very beautifully Frank very well thank you for your call we'll be right back [noise] much\nTo see the founder of the original Julius restaurant down Robert route cab owner of St john's seafood restaurant of teamed up the result is a new national chain called ... chicken and shrimp tip top chicken and shrimp features of time tested recipes some seafood and chicken and more the first tip top chicken and shrimp is open and made forty seven done avenue just wants to buy Ninety five\nFor a second we'll be opening in days of one oh one monument road just off limits all of them are competent and shrimp stump best you can ... now and he's forty seven ... avenue and soon monument or rode\nOne thousand people in your yard sale habitat Ramona flea market Ramona marketers open every Saturday and Sunday you need to buy and you can set up a yard sale or less money than it cost to bring wires people come to a remote doubly marketing deals on closed toys electronics produce more if you want to sell anything\nFrom household items to having a booth for your business you come to her a mode of marketing Ramona boulevard near I tend to not buy open Saturday and Sunday Dubai or information going seven eight thirty five thirty to\nChico sports present sit Spanish broadcast of the Jacksonville Jaguars all season long don't miss any of the games of the jaguars twenty he's season on WB obese one oh one point one asks\nHim and six hundred a listen to the broadcast in the Jacksonville Jaguars and ... this Sunday the jaguars will visit the undefeated he's\nGame stars and one was the process starting at ...

just some of what boys have to deal with\nJust talking about the importance of supporting our beliefs because of what goes on out there that's gotten a crab they're dealing with today in the capital

able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now\nBe real for a moment ... those folks and do the our our ... ... they're paid these are folks who don't have lives the rest of us will get a work we have lives\nAnd we uh you know they go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers are up to today yes those are all the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they're willing to get arrested so yes they did they are those people but nevertheless just in terms of winning hearts and minds\nIf they ... they are those people but nevertheless just in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nUs are segments talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's gone on for ever and a seemingly no resolution in sight but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is ever liked refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the fewest refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year\nOh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the applications\nBe implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay you to bring the refugees into the United states average costs tend to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five year cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready to hear how much it cost to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so\nWe can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we've made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement and young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason\nPeople automatically suggest that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost to import people in the competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nIf you really cared about the most vulnerable in society [noise] you'd get many opportunities that Donald Trump has been doing his policy [noise] once again [noise]\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise] two sides to stories\nOne side of the fact I brought him on the great one more call the\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimal got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nUh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer all go ahead and go

they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in in the Senate they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing of Brett Kavanaugh of things they have the actual physical evidence in regards to the Capitol had showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually for some reason\nTo believe that what they hear from this woman is actually true I'm not saying whether it is or is it flat\nBut I Believe I'm Sorry up or or Mr Mudd I made five boroughs democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things\nBut I I feel very sad that these democratic centers in Congress or confused in regards to\nWhat they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last chance and then we will see if they were right and if they're wrong they should actually think about resigning
