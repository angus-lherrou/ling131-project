chairman of the Trump for president campaign he was a former chairman of Breitbart News he was the one that engineered the improbable fall victory he's also was interviewed about a month ago I think\nBy the daily intelligence or which I've just tweeted out again it's the best interview done\nOn Trump voters and why Trump won and uh I gotta tell ya I printed it out when it first came out because I live with that I Am the person my wife and I what Steve is talking about and I read that once a week I read it every single week\nJust to remember why we're all doing this was the best article ever written Stephen K Bannon understands that Trump voters better than anyone in America and now he has just\nLaunched a twenty five percent pro Trump rapid response and polling operation\nThat is framing the midterms as an up or down vote on the president's agenda and it's called citizens for the American republic joining us now Steve Bannon Steve great to have you\nHey John I'm honored to be on the show and you know I'm a I'm a richer and boy so uh it's very close to my heart to be on your show so I'm sure there's such a big draw in my home town\nI Know and not only that but you went to Virginia Tech and Blacksburg and I was just there with my son last weekend he's a high school pitcher and they had a tournament at Virginia Tech so we got\nTo play on the big field it was a lot of fun but Steve I got to get back to this interview that you had where you defined white Trump won and the Trump voters and you related back to the fine natural crisis of two thousand they can you just elaborate on that and then we can ... it's all it all started off\nGuard popular trouble explosion that what Donald Trump olive tree down the ... all predicated upon the financial collapse of two thousand a very simple the elites in this country Republicans and Democrats Wall Street and corporate America\nBrought that All right and and that collapse or in in that cloud why in Congress or in a ministry about Bush and Obama to bail 'em out of several factors the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve it about a hundred and eighty billion dollars on the day\nThe the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve is about eight hundred eighty billion dollars on the day of the financial crisis in September of two thousand like a balance sheet other Federal Reserve the day that Donald Trump raised his hand and took the oath of office was four point five trillion dollars now what that means in your life\nIs that the fed just created money to bail out asset on real estate um ... you know guys stock you know the hedge funds and intellectual property in in the working people in this country pay the taxes that talks been fighting for example the big financial or the populist nationalist revolt was driven by a financial crisis\nBrought on by the elites which they bail themselves out and the taxpayer the little guy\nEnded up horrible you know pay the bird so I think that's why he's guilty this anger and that's why your introduction to this segment was I think stunning it sums up basically\nWhat has to happen this is a real lack of President Trump's forget about twenty twenty four\nWeeks you're having to first reelect of Donald Trump the entire program is on the table and if people saw last week in the cabinet hearings exactly how the Democrats are going to roll they don't want to talk about impeachment they don't talk about the Geisha but if you look at the New York times today which is the you know the the prompt out of the Democratic party\nThey've got like a ten page analysis on President Trump's taxes they intend to you know when to take the house too and I think during that works at the other day fifty two investigations of the Trump Administration they are going to bring the entire Trump program to a screeching halt\nAnd then there's going to be just a civil war between the two parties that's why it's imperative John in one of the problems we've got in a race is that\nTo separate out the signal from the boys the signal of Donald Trump could not be stronger that is to return America Turk a former right next to make the economic power\nManufacturing national security\nThat tasted the national interest of the United states\nOr in mind when we commit our troops and commit or a committed resources and throughout the world\nAnd it's too uh it's to bring the law and order to the United states and this was what a Trump or try and start to deconstruct this massive bureaucracy Washington DC that the Trump program and that's why the opposition is out to a out to the sky and so I think it's a pretty\nBinary choice you know if you if you like what Trump is doing and forget all the noise everything will be all the noises\nSlash and burn aid by the by the mainstream media just forget all that that's that's all noise that it's not be forgotten history the important things of history deconstructing the ministry of state you know winning the economic war with China bring bring back manufacturing base the United states getting our workers back to back employed and high paying job\nThat the Trump program that it'd be like that like the economy that go to the polls and bring some friends because it's going to be tightened things like Dave Brat and these congressional districts in Virginia I think right now going to go down to the wire so that every single folks' house\nJust in Virginia alone there's three very competitive races\nDistrict seven days you just mentioned just to to Scott's Taylor district ten\nBarbara predicting a against all odds is gonna win that Steven came back with us the former White House chief strategist Steve I got a couple more minutes tell us about your new political action committee citizens for the American dream public health begins in\nWhat is it an involved in as we have now what thirty three remaining days to them it serves\nA ... I started seeing for and it's basically the briefings to generate ideas can be a think tank to put some collection the bones of the populous movements to really start to think through tax plan at St do national security right now we don't have a\nA real think tank that generate it's number one and said generate ideas ... communications right now we have a twenty five percent a war over what we do rapid response all day long will polling what's being said about the president said about his policies a program where people we write talking points for to see people like Steve Cortez\nUp on CNN he's one of the people that works with us we give him talking points that now sort of people you see on cable t._v. all day long particularly people that go on CNN and MSNBC in addition we put people on TALK radio all day long and have a fighting op eds we have a booking department a research department of pony department we just did\nA massive national poll that was exclusive them down the hill the newspaper yesterday with mouse to bang up a pack a day on John McLaughlin what we really went and looked at the big things that are driving this\nAnd what what our polling shows that President Trump going back to the hard core issues that one or two thousand six taking his ... things on like immigration\nOr the economy and national security and so uh you know we're doing polling or doing more room but during rapid response we're doing ideas the last thing you do it to be a convening authority grass roots groups I came out of the ... the Tea Party movement and I'm a huge believer and grass roots usually run the ... and so this film trumpet more\nWhat we're doing is going around the country having rallies just exciting people the\nThe basic common citizens in this country the deplorable are the backbone of our country the backbone of this republic\nAnd uh in this seat for its really kind of a place to go and get news and information about the about the populist movements and uh and and ...\nInformation about the about the populous movements and uh and and the stone ... so I couldn't be more excited it's something I bought it for a long time and it's a it's kind of where my life has focused right now\nAll right we're excited about it now you can get more information on Steve Bannon's political action committee citizens for the American republic dot org citizens for the American republic dot org\nAnd I will soon tweet out a link that you will have home and thoroughly on the new film Trump\nThat war to van and I really appreciate your being with us I've only got one more minute I've got to ask you this question how did her all of the\nNever Trump hers running around the Republican National committee people that hated Trump from the very beginning how did they all end up in that West Wing how the hell did that happen Steve\n... is that we had to like you got ... when you win at two o'clock in the morning combat get on that night did you get what eight ten weeks to relieve the watch they tell you have four thousand ballots you have to fill a house and Senate confirmation\nPresident Trump and what we didn't have a deep\nActually one of the guys who are closest to us on the radio on on the campaign and it was a very famous staffed pain\nRemember I'd never been to a campaign office I think the president and drop dried lake accommodations with the Republican establishment and others are trying to pull together either leader meeting Trump reached out to people even droppers\nAnd how things would pull off and I think some of them work out at a lot of them didn't particularly I have a less problem with the never tropic than the progressive demographic that were brought in that clearly fought his program these global as far as part of it but Trump kind of one out there\nSo we are where we are very of is I think we're we're we're in good stead and you're on the same for a job I just was saying how much I appreciate your show at how much\nStanding there there's not just the ... movement but Trump voter\nThe Trump voter is basically the working men and women in this country the backbone of American society and uh and we have very few outlet really never makes it out to I'm Sorry I'm I'm I'm so proud of the fact that\nYou're in Virginia and getting out to the good folks that are coming about because Virginia is now in my home state but the uh the best state near ...\nAnd you're a hokey it just can't get any better than that and I'm not an animal ...\nJoining me now from Cairo are men in the middle east Edward uranium and with great to have you\nThank you John ...\nWow Edward where do we start here the first thing I Want to know about is this Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation fiasco\nWhat are they saying about this in the middle east like when you watch sky news or or you pick up the ... newspaper I mean how is this being reported back to other parts of the world\n[noise] well I think the BBC Arabic service is the one that's covering it the the closest or because they're broadcasting their English are reporting in in the Arabic\nUm and I think the BBC Arabic serve it to the BBC in general things to be aligned with the U.S Democratic Party so they're they've been given a lot of play to the accusation as as if it were you know a definitely a real legitimate accusation uh personally I I have my doubts about it a\nMuch stronger than that\nUm and the rest of the Arab media has been sort of sweeping under the rug because the sky news ah our idea based in the United Arab Emirates and us R B a TV in Saudi Arabia they both support President Trump so they are not playing up the fact\nThat his nominees in trouble um and the average this person that I've discussed it with the U.S seem to think that American politics\nAre have become very dirty so they're not you know they're they're not surprised about what's going on 'em and that's a distorted side of American Life is a you know getting the uh being focused on by the media and there is really not a lot of love for the media these days\nI'm among the Arab public a man I don't say that for any specific reason just that they think up same sense that we do that the media I'm no longer just get the facts and information\nBecause it's fake news Edwards that's really that's kind of the way you summed it up there okay let's get\nIt's called us fake news now Edward let's get to the un last week I was there as you know all week I Love doing that a un week 'cause it's a lot of fun to gene but you have to walk a lot because you can't take a cab anywhere because all the streets are closed and you get from a to B so you have to take some way or kept\nSo I was there all week and I was at the president's press conference on Wednesday in New York\nAnd he leaked out that his grand plan for the Israeli Palestine situation is a two state solution now here's what's interesting to me and I want to get your take on it\nSo here's a U.S president really the first one ever\nBoldly endorsing a two state solution basically what he said is I Believe in America first I Believe in sovereignty of my country therefore\nI have to believe that the Palestinians need sovereignty of their own country and they need self rule so I think they should have their own state this is the U.S president saying this\nSo you would think that President Abbas of Palestine would say okay well this is at least to start\nThis is a good thing or we want our own state so let's see if we can negotiate doesn't go from there and said he gets up on the un trashes the president blast Trump and says he's not going to negotiate and he doesn't want anything to do with the U.S evolve that\nI don't get that right I mean why wouldn't he want to find a way to get their own state and what Trump said was interesting he said look I'm a real estate guy this is all about real estate right who gets what land\nWho gets what incentives who gets what economic investment and we just got to get all this worked out and then they can have their own state and we can live happily ever ever after the other thing you said as you can't have peace in the middle east without peace between Israel and Palestine now that's\nUm and so he the individual we hired filed boy is with CIA and with the U.S postal inspection service which notably that was the entity for which where I actually worked um the difference with what I'm America Rising did on behalf of the congressional leadership fund as they filed for with the\nNational personal record center which has a different entity ... um the postal inspection service on their website\nUm requires that off with a request it off with the submitted via mail which is what our individual did\nUm and uh yeah and the response was never received back from us or we've never received anything back over all that didn't look particularly a confusing are alerting or problems with problematic to me because our only goal is to understand what would be the experience of someone else who was in a main road um\nBut then seeing is even though you're claims you did that for you and you've got to respond CNN so they did it for you on your ... and there was no record of it so yeah so there's also\nThe same entity that released my ... read acted personal national security questionnaire um so I mean at this point I have a little I have a little bit less safe in the fact that they are following the steps that they should be following I mean the the real the real issue here is the U.S postal service\nUm in violation of federal law depriving react\nWrote a released my national security questionnaire which is\nA fully protected document use in providing and processing a background background investigations and providing clearances and I of course received a secret clearance for my time in law enforcement and a top secret clearance with special compartment in\nA capacity is for my time with with the IRA and so the violation was when the U.S postal service violated the law by releasing that and then of course later it was distributed it fully under adapted formed by another entity\nSo are you saying that the spanberger team absolutely you're saying that you absolutely set of cost and now you're claiming that based on the top of that some of them releasing all of your unprotected information it's not out of reason to\nThink that they were competing and not being able to find the for you that you also but\nNow I'm actually saying that it's a distraction from the real violation of law\nAnd the violation of law curtailing the postal service broke the law by providing my information one of the pieces of the story that's also not reported on is that the national personnel records center actually initially denied the request when we ... the ... that America Rising submitted um\nAnd so there's so many more questions to the situation but really what it boils down to is there was a violation of federal law\nMy national security questionnaire which is the document that anyone who's seeking a security a security clearance filled out and those are not members of our military members of law enforcement numbers of the intelligence community fill out they\nProvide their detailed personal information not just about themselves but about other people in their lives on a very detailed information very personal information that document was released erroneously in violation of law\nAnd when an outside organization received that\nUm document they proceeded to pass it on two members of the media or without taking the steps to protect 'em my Social Security number my medical history any of that\nWell that was irresponsible no question about it so as far as\nThe information getting released do you think it was just in topping by somebody that just didn't know what they were doing or do you think there was some kind of a conspiracy\nThere's currently an ongoing investigation and so I I Can't necessarily comment on that topic\nFair enough let's get to a debate your opponent Dave Brat has said well we talked to was campaign about these debates he said that they had not officially committed to any debates beyond the first one in October fifteenth which is going forward\nAnd your team put out a very strongly worded statement\nBlasting day for backing out saying that there were supposed to be three debates of course the third debate was with me which has been set so that date has not been said even though I've asked about a hundred times the dirty work out for these scheduled debates I mean were they judge will grow up\nYeah so you know he's he's talked on your show even about the fact that we've agreed to multiple debates we had identified a location we identify to place a or teams had done independent walk through they had\nA uh they've done to walk through some of the ... we had told media partners we had the media lined up a local TV station that was going to\nUh to Eric racing was set up the only thing we hadn't done with sent out a press release um\nAnd that was something that we had been um a pushing for and uh certainly the house and the media partners had been pushing for\nUltimately then after a couple of weeks and and you know John I'm not the one taking the primary lead on this but I think I was about two weeks of our team the hosts end to the television station trying to get\n'em you know trying to get approval on how to put out the the wording on this\nUh we were told that he would no longer um be committed to doing that second debate that we had already detailed and that he would in fact or his team would in fact confirm it on the day of the sixteenth of October whether or not we would in fact to move forward with the with the debate scheduled for the twenty fifth\nOkay so as far as now the debate on the twenty fifth which is which was the second televised debate is not a done deal even though other team did a walk through they want to wait and see how the debate on the fifteenth us I guess you know\nI mean I'm I'm not going to sign a their their reasoning for wanting to wait until the sixteenth it it it seems like a plausible reason um but they they did not provide us with the reason why they want to wait until the sixteenth to now confirmed I Do know there's been staffing changes on his team that might have been a contributing factor\nUm but but overall when we set up the parameters of the debate one of the things that was important to our team that we expressed to his team was that given that it is a a large district um and certainly\nWas that given that it is a a large district um and certainly a from North to south stretches quite a quite a long distance that it was important to us to have the ability to have debates throughout the district north center of the district middle of the district in southern portion of the district so they are under vigils would be able to attend\n'em and and that was something that was a priority because now are the first and as of right now the only debate is in the very northern part of the district which\nA priest place has a pretty significant burden on anyone coming from the southern portion of the district or even the center of the district to to get to colpepper particularly given the\nTime of the debate for my ... no good tickets for that one they sold out within less than a minute right um and\nThere's many many individuals who've reach out to our campaign saying that they tried to get tickets but were unable to do so\nWell and the mind which was the third debate I've not gotten a date from those team the spanberger team I just want to mention has said that they've given me a bunch of ... to go back to the team with we've not been able to get that done either hopefully we'll get that done to the next week or so\n... so you're not in the U.S Senate you're not running for the U.S Senate but I Know you have an opinion appears now that the FBI background check that's been done they can't find any additional crops you think you should get confirmed on Saturday or not\nSo I I Do question the fact that the um and I of course I haven't read the FBI report um but I I Do have some concerns about the fact that some of the\nMajor allegations that they were meant to look into that the individuals making those allegations were not\nUm interviewed as part of that investigation and then a allegedly from what I've read in in the media that cabin also wasn't interviewed\nYou know over over all my concern regardless or separate from I should say separate from the allegations that were made against him last week um I think that watching his testimony did raise the major questions about his suit ability\nOr his temperament and his uh ability to be um a\nNonpartisan role you know the the thing that I think is really important is this isn't a cabinet position he isn't meant to be in a role where he's directly supporting the president or where we're partisanship would be expected in and frankly aligned with the ... this is a lifetime\nAppointment to the Supreme Court a lifetime appointment I'm at the highest level of our court for someone who is meant to be on\nOnly driven to uphold the law\nI'm partisan to the constitution and so I was disappointed to see\n'em and hear some of the things that he said\nUh last week during his testimony and I I personally found them worrying for those reasons\nYet Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has blasted President Trump and his policies publicly on numerous occasions so what's the difference\nSo I think looking at her [noise] looking looking at\nHer record on the bench in the way that she has conducted herself as a judge the way that she has conducted herself in ... in discussing issues of the law and issues of\nA\nLegislation and issues of executive power\nUm when we look at the judicial branch is being a check on the legislative

dear friend of mine are also of of a Norwegian heritage ah passed away two years ago\nAnd uh a month after he died I ah had a vision of him and he came to me and it was very clear vision of him and he told me all about his the spirit world you know his uh his after like what is after life was like and it was quite detailed\nAnd a ... he he actually gave me the the name of the book timeless that's that comes from my friend gene but ah he told me that in in the spirit world that he was in there is there's no there's no future there is no past it just as he said I just am\nAnd it's just all the present everything is just president and he said it was it was very it was a very nice and uh he had no more\nBut I don't hear about it or I start to stop stop Dr talking to Dr Yeah Dr Bruce all of Solazyme has written a book called the homeless paranormal personal history I don't care about his history told me about your history tell me about a paranormal experience that happened to you\nWhile this division Adam and was was a paranormal experience I can tell you about it a demonic experience that I had\nYes a lot of money in your goals especially ... especially if you're driving in an Eighteen wheelers through the Pennsylvania wilds or on route eighty or an eye twenty through Dallas those are those are the ones we want to hear please share with us a demonic experience doctor\nOkay sure so uh I was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage a floor and ah all of a sudden a this call him a fire appeared uh from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head\nAnd so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and in art\nAnd it was it was moving like a like a river of fire and there was this low guttural voice was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand and uh I I pinch myself I slap myself just to make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that\nThat was it was terrifying and and I uh\nI got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she told me to come over and she was quite worried about me she said come over in the morning\nAnd ah I did and then when I was there she told me well you should maybe we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it and you know don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it wasn't it was\nReal higher in I think what no I yeah and he was Columbine and all of the fire engulfed you while you were sleeping while you were in that well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me\nYou know this is talk of Bruce all over so high now the reason I wanted to Dr Bruce on because every hour I get a pitch from somebody who's written a book who's had psychic experiences but the difference when Dr Bruce is Dr Bruce all of Solazyme is a big deal he's a Fulbright Scholar and professor\nBut he had to wait until his retirement to write this book\nAbout his paranormal personal history the name of the book is timeless a paranormal personal history\nAnd he documents thirty four incidents of paranormal events in his life\nTo let the the telecast nieces ghost demons guardian
