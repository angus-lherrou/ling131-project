American one version at a whole bunch\nOf extra do on the radio show today I'm doing a um show that's going to take all four segments to get through a apologizes not normal radio normally give people a little piece of something that each segment you walk into a ... in totality\nUh inedible bite but uh this is something that if you're going to need to go to the Web site get our podcasts and listen to the whole show because this was a lot of information that I'm sharing with you and I'm trying to get you to understand the difference between getting ripped off\nBy your stockbroker your financial planner and your syndicator uh compared to being very successful in syndication world\nAnd so we pick it back up here at the fact that it lifestyles I set out to teach people how to buy their own real estate why because you get much more casual much more capital gains a much more depreciation expats\nTo be able to cover your income is a much better way to invest in real estate period bar none conversation over don't care what you have to say\nExcept for one argument people that have highly compensated jobs\nThat are very very busy have complicated lives with kids doing all kinds of things or they don't have the time in their mind and I say only in their mind to go out there and on their own real estate\nHonestly you can own a small apartment complex and on a very busy job you get a management people that take care of it all few hours a week and you're ... you're done but they don't believe that so they want it went dead so I had people asking me to invest here's where we need to make it very clear delineation\nMy personal investments have nothing to do with lifestyles are limited I was a real estate investor who started it education and mentoring program\nBut as I educated mentor people I talk to people people touched me and they said they'll can I just jump in on your deal\nAnd so when I let people come into my deal had nothing to do with lifestyle so limited it just added to do with okay I'll let your partner and I gave them with their share of the deal whatever poor\nIt got I didn't take any\nEgregious override or upfront the middle of the back beat construction the manager be leadership be whatever I just said look I'll take\nBack be construction the manager be leadership be whatever I just said look I'll take a disproportionate share of the profits because I'm doing all the work and uh if we make a dollar\nOut there you get your Sharon I get my share if we don't make a dollar I get nothing no fees up front no middle fees know back in the snow sideways fees no nothing I make a dollar\nOr we make a dollar I get my theory is you're absolutely aligned perfectly perfectly aligned in what we were trying to do you got your share the depreciation I got my share of the depreciation you got your share of the cash flow I got my share of the cash flow you got your share of the capital gains I got my share of the capital gains\nYou got your share of the appreciation I got my share of the appreciation ...\nThe perfect investment as a passive investor now here's what happened with that as it went on other people wanted to do that\nThey say wow that looks neat do what you're doing because you're able to do more real estate deal because you've got all these people putting your money you can grow very rapidly\nAnd they saw that they paid attention to that so they tried to do it themselves now these deals they put together with their own deals lifestyles are limited is a is an education a mentor and program nothing to do with us they put these deals together and what happened was some worked in some didn't\nHere's where the rubber meets the rodents indications\nSome of these guys are put these deals together and I said guys because at the beginning it was almost all guys now it's men and women but in the beginning it was almost all guys or their dad aren't aren't er or or the best salesman I got a pretty face I drive a nice car dress nice and I'm the guy that looks so impressive you want to give me your money\nAnd they go out there and they'd raise capital into a deal the problem was some of these guys were bad actors some of them were unscrupulous some of them\nWere idiots some of them had no operational skills at all\nYou know a salesman are done or to act and get your money out of your pocket I can talk you out of anything I Am about da da da da da da de la ... da da da da da da\nDa da da da Silva ... they have no stick with it at all\nAnd they would start the project in the projects would make no money and when the projects made no money since they got paid off of the profit there was no prop fat\nAnd so what happened is they just dropped the deal runaway leaving all the people to put their money into the deal high and dry\nSo I came up with the theorists would look this doesn't make any sense what we need to do is real lives of operating these properties is a job it's a business\nAnd so there needs to be a management fee whereas if the guy who's running the deal bales\nYou can buy a management company to come in and run the company and the numbers are right with that management company in there now that\nMeant the deal had to be more profitable than it was in the past or the buyers into the deal had to be willing to take any less or profit then what they were taking before because now there was a guaranteed fee coming out called management company B.\nAnd my theory was if you got to management company the and the guy's a complete loser you just kick him out or he goes away and you put in somebody you can operate the property and the property does it you know go to death I mean think about it if you if you\nIf you try to get a management company to come in there on a deal you only got paid a profit no management company going to do that they want to get paid a fee so now we're in the world these now we're in the world of people getting paid for sure\nTo do this now you can take people that are not entrepreneurial but just want a job I Want to get paid\nTo come in and do the job come and it'd be a syndicator I called them lead investors lifestyles that's not a real world out there and the real world but I called him the guy that puts the whole thing together I called the leader buster that's my verbiage has nothing to do with the real world most people out there\nCalled ... to get right so what happens is is that these guys started coming in and now they were getting paid now they can afford to quit their job and do this is a fulltime job will that solved quite a bit of a problem because now you got their full attention on the deal\nBut some people still weren't good enough some people didn't have the skill sets necessary to do this and like I said the better the salesmen you are usually the worst you are at being an operator\nIt just because you're so greedy thinking about everybody that sells I always laugh and brings sales back down to the lowest common denominator for salespeople and by the way I've been a sales person my whole life but think about it\nIf you ever meet a girl that works in a dance is a dancer\nAnd she gets paid by the look by the touch by the night she walks out of there are five hundred dollars tax free every night you're not going to get her to get a regular job\nYou get a bartender the gets paid five hundred bucks a night in tips you're not going to get that person to ever take a regular job these people to get paid on commissions and especially big commission to instantly and over and over and over again\nThey're not going to ever care about business operations success or profit that stuff means nothing you guys all they care about is the next deal the next transaction and the next set of these and commissions they can or\nThat's what's going on out there in the Internet right now with the syndicated around\nThe bees bees bees bees and the\nNon profit profit Robyn we're right back when he wants to\n[noise] do\nAre the finance and get no way to get out of it there was no way to to exit strategy the property all these things were about stuff that these guys you didn't know right then you go on\nAnd you have bad promoted or people that were illegally promoting deals you know these indications are actually controlled by or they're\nLegally supposed to be watched by the SEC there are specific rules and regulations for doing this for raising capital and one of those\nIs not advertising one of those is making sure you have only accredited and or a sophisticated investors\nAnd many of these people were just taking anybody there are throwing people the deal they knew nothing about real estate which you can't do\nTaking people that were not accredited didn't have enough money to be ... credited and valuing bold enough to get into these deals they're letting people in brothers mothers sons front hey tell your buddies about it\nAnd people were getting into shouldn't get in\nThey didn't understand what they were doing and these people were at risk of losing their entire life savings\nBecause these bad actors were doing illegal promotions to get these people in these deals now this is just some of the limitations actors that came out of all this but very quickly very quickly myself and\nThe other lead investors which is what I call the syndicator ... that were good that we're very good we came to the conclusion that boy these bad people are going to wreck our reputation out there in the marketplace now understand again lifestyles has nothing to do with the deals we\nAll know part of the deals we do not promote or solicit the deals we our education and mentoring program but this accumulation of members who are all friends\nWho are all acquaintances we got together and said boy if these guys continue to do this terrible stuff the people there is going to be some backlash or something that's gonna wash off on a somebody's going to go war all those people over there don't really know what they're doing\nAnd so does people got together the best people we had and they decided to come up with something we call the white paper white paper was a set of rules that you had to follow\nOr you could not syndicate within the group\nOf members that were lifestyles unlimited numbers now we went to attorneys and said look we don't want to be a part of these deals were these rules are about the\nThe fact that we're all part of a group of like minded people that all agree\nThat there should be as little risk as possible there should be as many rules in place to protect\nThe money the passive investors as possible the rules also protect the leads because it talks about how you have to operate the property how are you located evaluate the Ghost Ship contract close operate the property how you pay your distributions what those distributions should be and can be\nAnd what you need to put it into the deal so you've got some skin in the day and there's all kinds of rules that protect the passive the leads\nDon't need to be protected they're in control it's the passage that needed to protect\nAnd so our attorney said look you're not in the deals they can do whatever they want their their deals\nBut you can and you had the right to remove them from the membership of lifestyles a limited if they're bad actors if they will follow the rules that your group has set up to protect the group\nThe entire group of lifestyles investors then you have the right to refuse the entrance of or access to the membership you can\nRemove them as a member and so we set up these rules and regulations had everybody by and and everybody that wanted to be as solicitor within the group which side and agree to follow these rules\nNow you have to understand if you don't side and agree to follow them nobody in the group is going to invest with you because the people that are investing of going why would you not signed this which protects me argued that greedy your dad egregious your that arrogant\nYou think you know it so well that you can still\nMoney without doing it the right way why would you do that\nAnd so lifestyles deals started becoming much much much better the average\nBecame better the quality became better the down side deals became less and all of a sudden people were very very happy\nBut then we ran into the next level\nAnd the next level was information\nThe kinds of information necessary for these leads to do a great deal on these\nInvestments for these indicators which I call it leads to do it right we needed an education program to prove that they knew what they were doing\nPasses putting money into deals they don't understand having no idea if it's the right deal for them to invest it and that was also a problem when I come back to share it with you how we saw both of those educational problems we'll be right back with the dome wants to lead\nTo [noise]\nYou're listening to the radio show will be back with more like
