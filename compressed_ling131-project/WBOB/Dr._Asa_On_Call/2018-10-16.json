at a time bombs and he spoke\nAbout go do on the radio show today I'm trying to make a point for the fact that markets although they can be cyclical we believe them to be cyclical I Believe cycles can expand that what do I mean by that\nWhat I mean is is that if you have one dollar it only takes one dollar to be a hundred percent return a hundred percent return on one dollars a dollar\nSo the cycle can go from burning you ten percent return which is ten cents\nTo a twenty percent return which is twenty cents down to a nothing returned very easily\nBut what if you're earning not a dollar but you're earning a hundred thousand dollars\nYou would think that it would make sense and secondly it would be just as easy to go from you know ten percent return which would be ten thousand dollars and twenty percent return which is twenty thousand you would think those numbers all the law\nBut I'm just going to use those numbers do not align that the larger the number is the harder it is to get it to move\nThat just strange concept but I Believe this is my whole life I've noticed back when I was buying real estate\nWhen I first started as by very very inexpensive stuff cheap stuff old stuff worn out stuff and I could er twenty thirty percent return on cash flow from day one but it was only paying ten thousand dollars a unit for that stuff\nBut when you got up to where you're paying\nTwenty thousand it was twice as hard to get the income to go up by the same percentage when you pay thirty it was three times as hard and now that we're looking at stuff anywhere from eighty and I've actually looked at stuff myself now in the last two years from a hundred and twenty\nLast week I looked at what two hundred thousand dollars a door\nThat you got to think about that\nWould you make that kind of percentage change when something's two hundred thousand dollars a door when someone's paying thirty five hundred and four thousand dollars a month rent\nHow do you raise the rent will let's say a rage with a hundred bucks that's nothing percentage wise where when people were paying four hundred dollars a month threat they raised it to five hundred that was a twenty five percent rate increase but a hundred and thirty five hundred is nothing\nSo what I'm suggesting you is this cycle has scaled to the point where the return\nThe cycle has scaled to the point where the returns have got to go down because the cost of getting in the business is so high\nYet at the same token the cycle has expanded so we're we take you at number of days to get from point a to point B and then to Boise and then to point B and then to hit the end of the cycle and come back to pollinate again that that period of time has to change\nIt has to change almost directly with the size of the change because it takes longer to make those larger changes large enough to send the cycle through it's loops\nNow this is just projection this is my theory no economists out there or spouse in this\nI was bouncing it cause I sat back now for twenty seven years I've had to watch every single years my members invest and buy real estate year after year after year and every once in a while every like four years ago I said man we're peeking in this market is probably going to be over by next year\nAnd the next year after that I go you know what I think we are peaking\nLast year I decided to sell my real estate properties off 'cause I thought we had gone past the beat and we were on the edge of a bubble while I was selling cars will buy\nWe discuss their notes we share notes and although I got out of historic highs be able to get back in I'm going to have to get back in and historic highs\nSo\nLet's take a look at some of the numbers will start with single family work this whole seminar not dissimilar talk radio show will work this through two departments let's start with single\nFamily houses right now first time homebuyers are thirty two percent of all the buyers and the problem with that is is that\nThey don't build small houses anymore let me give me an example the median home right now it's two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars the average home is three hundred and thirty one thousand dollars that let's go back to when I bought my first told\nI purchased my first rental property at twenty five thousand dollars at the time the media and was fifty thousand All right so let's think about this I bought it at fifty cents on the media will the mediums two hundred and forty\nThat means we can buy a house as a hundred and twenty and still be buying them at the same\nThe same discount I was buying at at the bottom of a recession in other words when it was the absolute best time to buy with the world had exploded and things were going for fifty cents on the dollar\nI was buying a fifty cent to the median price\nWell guess what folks were still buy houses eighty Ninety a hundred thousand dollars hundred and ten a hundred and twenty all day long which is below fifty percent of the median price we are killing it\nAnd not realizing it because those prices are\nHigher than we've ever been willing to pay in the investment world but not understanding that the stuff that's being built is higher than it's ever cost in the history\nAnd the people coming out to buy their home now the first time home they're looking at prices two hundred and forty thousand\nTwo hundred and up\nAnd so who are the first time homebuyers these are the millennials twenty five to thirty thirty five years of age got their first big paying job maybe just got married or have a you know relationship maybe had their first baby and they're living with mom and dad they got to get out\nBut to get out they got to come up with the price of a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home\nThat's a big chunk to pay for it really is\nI remember when I got out my first time I bought was a condo for forty thousand bucks and I mean forty thousand compared to two hundred and forty dollars I Know it's Thirty years later forty years later whatever it is but it's still massively different\nSo how does that hook up with the apartment business will back when I first got in the apartment business or buying apartments that were old worn out tired low and stuff for ten thousand dollars a door the high end stuff the stuff I really want to do but I couldn't afford it was like forty thousand fifty thousand\nAnd the median home prices back then for like a hundred thousand dollars so\nI ... I remember I got out of single family housing because single family house as the media went to Seventy five thousand Seventy six thousand somewhere I said man is the housing business just getting too expensive or you can buy a house for Seventy six thousand dollars and make any\nMoney with it so I went to apartments where I could buy these old beat up apartments for cheap and fix them up and make some money with\nBut if you look back and say okay back then we were buying apartments anywhere from for bottom feeding stuff like I was buying a ten thousand or door to really nice cutting edge stuff for forty or fifty thousand a door\nAt houses really showing for Seventy six thousand or we were paying percentage wise the value of a new home\nVery very close nowadays it's not so we're not even that close we're not even close to close what we're paying for apartment doors compared to prices will blow your mind and I'm going to come back after the break and go into it\nAnd show you how far off we are how much lower were buying apartments for\nWhat single families cost people got to live somewhere you're going to go to the place they can afford eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to allow them to be right back with Adele ... radio show\nThis all leads them to demand as more and more millennials are wanting to move in to the household world in other words owned their own household by themselves\nThere's more and more demand for apartments and not as much demand for houses because they can't afford to buy those houses\nThey don't have the buying power to buy those expensive houses twenty five percent down on now I think you ... you know five percent down but you have to be able to stand for the mortgage payments you have to pay for all the maintenance repair mowing the yard all utilities obit\nSo it is sending demand over to the apartment industry so there's more demand for the apartment industry and the apartment industry\nIs putting up more supply so what happened in two thousand eight when the recession hit they stopped building so to nine to ten tool Evan\nNot until about two twelve did you start seeing apartments come back on line or when they did there was a shortage of apartments there was a shortage of housing for many years so what happens is boom big giant swing the pendulum and everybody jumps and started building stuff\nBut they're building class race there is no more class bees and class sees they stopped even naming anything a class de if it's a building it's a class you know even if it's a piece of garbage in the bad part of town they're called the classic they've eliminated the designation de\nBecause everything that you could put a human being in his right to vote on this day and age\n[noise] that's a market ship books I mean when I got in the business ... there was stuff that people shouldn't live in and they're not even condemning it any more they're going to pay anything you put a body and nowadays is a sea that's blue collar living wow\nTell me this market hasn't changed told me the curb hasn't changed a cycle hasn't changed it's unbelievable\nWhat else control supply and demand how about jobs it's talking about jobs for say we are right now at the lowest unemployment level since twenty thirty forty fifty years ago I don't know whether it was but it's been a long time\nLess than four percent you're now in a situation we were when I was growing up where there was called I'm\nUnderemployed in other words there's no it was over ... over employment there's so many people have jobs and so many jobs wanting people that it's a wonder we don't have inflation\nWhatever they're doing the fed is doing something that's holding down inflation fairly well because now it's going to be driven by the fact that people can start getting higher wages\nNow Mary that with what Donald Trump just in\nThis new tax law is going to change things dramatically companies are going to make twenty five percent more money than they were paying forty two percent tax at the corporate level now they're paying twenty five\nI mean it's a ... percent cutting taxes guys these companies are going to be gushing with cash so when there's a lack of people to work for them when they're trying to expand these wonderfully profitable businesses\nThey're going to have to offer higher wages I had my staff come to me already and so you know I think it would have a higher offer offer higher wages for people even like our entry level people you know a receptionist and stuff a lot more money now because you can go out on the street and wow it's happening\nSo people are going to have more money\nRight so there's going to be more money to buy with buying indexes are all up\nConsumer indexes that study how people feel about the future they're all up\nEverybody except the talking heads on TV Democrats believe the Trump is going to blow this thing apart and it's going to become incredibly positive for everybody because you don't believe in trickle down economics that's fine I I get that\nBut the bottom line is when there's more money out there and there's less jobs are there's more jobs than there are people wages have to go up\nAnd they're going to go for everybody doesn't matter with your white black Hispanic Chinese Indian wages are going up\nAnd so you've got this perfect storm where the economy is booming we're ... at the point in the cycle when you'd say the cycle should be shutting down now it should be over\n\nBut it's the beginning of a new peak because everything that Trump did\nWow think of that now one more thing they've slowed down the amount of new apartment complex was coming on line two thousand Eighteen will bring less product on line the two thousand Seventeen did yet two thousand Eighteen we'll have more demand\nMore to man less supply higher rents higher occupancy he's it's common bugs it's all happening right before our eyes the economists are saying it and the baby to delete holding their breath going I Can't predict what\nThis is going to do because it doesn't make sense and I don't want to be wrong I'm sitting here right now saying I'm willing to be wrong it's happening and

grocery store the snow was falling on Christmas Eve you want to hear what happens don't you know we've all been there to meeting that person that we broke up with that person we went to school with maybe wanting to avoid maybe wanting to see\nIt Canada personal songs leader of the band stands out is one of the ... most treasured the song originally appeared on the singer songwriters Nineteen eighty one album the innocent age is photo birds loving tribute to his musician father Lawrence\n... wrote this in two thousand three about his dad he was a musician and educator and band leader I was so gratified that I was able to give him that song before he passed on\nPogo ... dad died in August of Nineteen eighty two but not before this hit song made him a celebrity with numerous media interviewers interested in him as the inspiration\nHere's de info Byrd speaking about his single leader of the band in Nineteen Ninety One I\nIt would have been [noise]\nBecause what that meant to my father and to me and there's no way I could quantify that or even explain it um\nMy father passed away over ten years ago now and\nHe he got to hear that song he got to see this enjoyed the success of that so\nPeople were calling him on the phone and interviewing him and his last days you know who is this mandate of the band you\nAnd he just he loved that and I loved that cause I respected him so much I mean he gave me everything I Am really my mother and he we're both musicians and\nThe idea of being a living legacy is really the truth\nI don't think I'll ever be as accomplished musician as he was\nBut um I've had a different gift came to me in a different way I've been able to reach\nA touch people [noise]\nAnd that one is probably touched more people more deeply than anything I've ever done\nAnd by the way don't we all want to have our sons and daughters speak that way about us and again that's why we do these stories folks because you don't hear him anywhere else\n... music was powerful in its simplicity he didn't rely on the volume of his voice to convey as emotions instead they came through in the soft tender delivery and his amazing lyrics\nHere for example is the core is the leader of the band and which ... churches and inspired to someday possess the same love and musical ability as his dad\nAnd these are from the song this is of course the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old but his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul my life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man I'm just living legacy to the leader of the band\nIn the industry we recall any book that last for more than a year to recall them perennial write a book that's lasted for ten years would be a a very big success\nBut the irony is if you pull up a New York times best seller list and you go to the the fine print at the bottom it says among the categories not actively track at this time our perennial sellers so there's this term\nWe know that these books that that last and last and yet most of our focus in the industry whether we're making books or music or movies is about new things\nIt was in two thousand Fifteen actually for the first time in the music business that catalog albums officially out sold new releases\nAnd so we know that the things that were made a long time ago if you think of many of your favorite books and movies and TV shows and restaurants many of them are not brand new it's actually the ones that have really stood the test of time that we returned to over and over again\nAnd yet it it's strange where most of the energy in these industries go and so what's so fascinating about cereals connelly's sort of journey as\nHe's writing about this but then can he actually do it right you know he's writing a book about creating lasting enduring work well\nI I was fascinated by the idea of like could could actually do it was he sort of like a a literary Babe Ruth ... hit the ball where he set out to to hit it where he pointed and told the crowd or the picture that he was going to hit it\nAnd the book it it it never became a sort of a massive cultural trendy sensation but it did endure you know it it was published in Nineteen thirty seven and then in ... through a World War through political revolutions through bad\nDivorces new fashion styles massive technological disruption and so many other things that if it was given a second edition ten years later so Nineteen forty seven or Nineteen forty eight it was published\nAnd then in two thousand eight it was published in its third edition\nAnd then it's still reading today and and here I Am talking to to you guys about it and so it's a book that's outlived him and almost everything else published at that time it's er into the author or a cult like following among fellow writers and creative\nAnd I think what's so impressive is that he\nSet out to achieve this thing and then he and he did it he has another quipped he said you know I'd like my my work to outlive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how how many books and projects that creative kill themselves to make\nAnd how femoral most of them are\nJames solitaire is one of my favorite novelists I was reading one of his books not long ago and on the back which wouldn't it wouldn't have been written by hand but it it described his novels is having a sort of him perishable freshness and I I just love that idea I ... I Love the idea of making something\nPerennial some thin him perishable something that stands the test of time\nAnd by my goodness when we're watching Shawshank Redemption on TV or the godfather for Ninety it's time we know we're watching perennials right and they give us more satisfaction that so much of the new stuff that we know who's going to be old stuff really fast\nHere's Ryan sharing some stories from his own background that prompted them to create books and other work the stands the test of time\nI've always had this lifelong fascination with things that were old when I was a teenager everything I like it was all my favorite bands and released their albums decades before I was born um\nThey were still going strong by the time I came around I I remember picking up the great Gatsby in high school and thinking how incredible it is that this book that was written to be a critique of the Jazz Age right it was a timely periodical\nCould have endured and and somehow been so so timeless and and true even to a a random high school or in California you know sixty plus years later and\nMy first job as a writer I was a research assistant to an author named Robert Green wrote a book called the forty eight laws of power this was a book that didn't hit the bestseller list until a decade after it had come out and and yet quietly and slowly it sold\nMore than a million copies and been translated into dozens of languages I I Would guess I don't know a hundred years from now people would still be reading it and um another book that I worked on you know got a Seventy five hundred dollar advantages this tiny advances what they call a kiss off advance and the industry\nMeaning that the the lowest amount of money they can give you without hurting their feelings and they hope you'll go away and that book went on a cell over a million and a half copies and and you know now ten years after its release it sells about\nThree hundred copies a week and I I went on as a marketer became the director of marketing that American Apparel and\nIt was interesting that this company which will hundreds of millions of garment every year the best selling items word of the items created at the beginning of the company's trajectory it was ... and they had this mission of making\nBunnies trajectory it was ... and they had this mission of making\nMaking things that would be sold in Vinton shops in the future and I I just love this idea of making things that can laugh with with my own books you know perhaps the readers haven't haven't heard of me or they certainly wouldn't have seen me on the New York times best seller lists are for the most part\nAnd yet quietly and and like clockwork they sell about five thousand copies across the various titles that every single week and the marketing for them has long since finished and yet you know surprise or one of my books did appear on a best seller list last week\nA year after it had come out and so it's this idea of making things that resonate with people that really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as a creative would have been what to expect when you're expecting because every day\nIn every part of the world or a couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and so I'm I'm fascinated by that kind of where the the the work that indoors and it it saddens me that so much work that is made doesn't indoor and so I was fascinated by this question of sort of what similarities\nTo these works have in common and I set out I interviewed a all sorts of of authors and editors and producers and\nA marketers and entrepreneur is and and I tried to get to the bottom of what makes things a laugh then I you know I found a few things I think first is that work needs to be unique if it it's very hard for it to endure if it is not\nDefinitive if it if it doesn't stand out stand alone and yet on the other hand\nIt should do a very simple job I didn't want them one of my editors said to me one time she said Ryan it's not what a book is\nIt's what a book does and by that she meant it has to do something for the leaders not necessarily about what it does for the creator it's about what it does so what to expect when you're expecting it it helps you with this difficult time in your life\nAnd and I think that's what the best the best work does you know it's this this question this is a blank\nThat does blank for black if you can't fill those in as a creator you're going to have a lot of trouble I I was interested in the cast that max Martin in one of the greatest songwriter is certainly the most prolific and popular signers of all time it's written for everyone from Celine Dion to the back street boys\nTo Bon Jovi to Taylor Swift and\nHis subjects his music to what he calls the car test to get in his car in Los Angeles\nAnd I put the top down it puts it on the stereo and he drives up and down the Pacific coast highway is music\nAdding to that experience at the idea that even use it is designed to really do something for the audience is something I think that people ness and and so that that's an essential part of this sort of creative process\nAnd when we come back more from Ryan Holiday on his book the perennial seller and my goodness what a fascinating question what makes things last not just our products that\nMaybe even a marriage\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place where students study all the things that matter in life\nAll the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nAnd then we have some hills they'll find this coming year until their own stories and produce stories and I can tell you there's no better place to teach\nAnd they teach everything that matters as I said before history and philosophy literature the constitution and so much more and here's the good news if you can't get to Hillsdale\nHillsdale can come to you with their terrific and free online courses\nGo to Hillsdale dot edu to learn more\nThe courses are free the lessons are priceless and it's a perfect summer education to tell your friends tell your folks to church at school in anywhere else friends and family gather go to the hills bill dot edu and sign up for their free courses now that she'll Dale\nWho's going to pitch your work if not you right who's going to sell this than if you're not interested in selling it and so that's what I\nEnded up telling a lot of creative there's no magical from that you can hire there's no magical button you can press there's no magical media outlet even being on this wonderful show isn't going to guarantee that my book perennial seller is going to\nFind all the people who are interested in finding it and so if you're not going to do it who will\nAppear drunk or the management expert who said that each project need someone\nWho says I'm going to make this succeed and then goes to work and does it that that has to be you know so I push create is to think of marketing and not even\nYou know so I push create is to think of marketing and not even as an obligation but as a essential part of the creative process can you be as creative\nIn your media appearances in marketing and your ways of getting customers as you were and writing every page or you know developing the\nUh the vintage of wine that you're you're selling or the the boots that you want it to produce right how can that be as much of a of a canvas to paint on to make something special as as the venue you made itself and\nA lot of creative fail at this I mean the the the shelves grown with and watched movies and on read books and\nYou know our phones are filled with downloaded music and hard cast that will never get around and seeing and so that urgency that sense of I've got to make people care about this is really the essential task of the writer or the creative of any kind you know if you build it\nThey will not come that it's not how it works you have to make them you have to invite them one by one it until the crowd is full until the ... the seats are filled and that's why you did this
