B. dot com [noise]\nI Love your back and now here's some more conventional wisdom sets you free man on a mission to retire America One version at a time bombs and can you get back\nTo the radio show today I'm going to share with you six reasons that real estate out performs other investments um any one of the six could be as good as some other investment\nBut the fact that this has all six of them at the same time makes it undeniably the most profitable investment you could possibly make so we're going to cover this through the show if you want to follow and we'll start with the first thing that most investments cannot do and that is called captured equity\nWhat does that mean that means I go out there and because the market is so\nImperfect is the term I'd like to use\nIt's very easy to find situations where you can buy something below what its value is simply by below what its value is so you've got a guy the gal out here that want to sell their home a ... real good shape so it doesn't really qualify for Fannie Mae loan and let's say that the home is worth\nTwo hundred thousand dollars\nBut there's ten thousand dollars with the repairs need to be made before bed you made with lead on the home\nSo you would think you buy the house for one Ninety but that's just not how it happens what happens is we go out there and we buy that house for a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and so we capture forty thousand dollars of equity\nRecall this captured equity now thinking about what that would mean let's say you go to the stock market and say I want to buy IBM stock or you want to buy Microsoft stock and you say okay I Want to buy two hundred thousand dollars with the Microsoft stock what are you going to pay for that stock\nYou're going to pay two hundred thousand so go to your stockbroker go no no no what I Want to do is I Want to buy two hundred thousand dollars worth of IBM stock and only pay a hundred and sixty thousand dollars for the new stockbrokers they look at you like you're in saying you're out in your mind it can't be done\nBecause it can't it any other investment they get traded an open trading market that can't be done now you could do there should be by used cars you can go out there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf the time with this something that is really the six benefit but I Want to make it clear that the six benefit spread out multiple different ways across these different benefits across different games and that is\nTax wise\nIf you earn money from a CD or a money market account or a savings account or stocks that David is taxable as ordinary income\nSo let's say you make two percent of that same discount\nYou lose thirty percent of that now you down to the one point and see that'd be six off at one point four percent right let's say you make four percent\nIn stock David it's now you take thirty percent off of that and thirty percent of for them and it's going to take you down to two point one to point two percent\nRight that's that's what happens which would taxation and so when you look at that\nThe spread and return is even larger because of the tax consequences of the way real estate gets taxed compared to other income and the way they get taxed so you just you can see that to understand what it's all about so I sit in all the time\nHow is it investment if there isn't cash how is there an investment if it isn't cash\nThinking about that how was your investment if there is a cash ... now thinking about this also if you own a piece of real estate\nAnd your own some stocks and the stocks go down\nYou have a lawsuit anything but you haven't gained anything if you own a piece of real estate in the market shifts and the market value the risk that goes down if you don't sell you haven't lost anything but you still burning the distributions\nSo it's completely different if you value of your stock goes down the amount of your distributions go down\nBut in the real estate world if the world's crashes and real estate values go down people stop buying houses\nAnd they start renting that's what happened to two thousand eight nine and ... continue to happen and breads have gone up every single year since I've ever been a real estate I don't see red decreases now I'm sure there are somewhere I mean but it has to be situational for example in Michigan Detroit\nWhen all the businesses went out of business that you know the auto deals auto manufacturing went up as\nPeople left the city when people leave the city there's houses everywhere will then yes rents are going to go down and somehow this can't be rented\nBut that's an anomaly you got to keep that in mind that to nominate it's not an anomaly in the stock market on any day week month per year for that sucker to go down that just something we can do so cash flow by the way out as this question how do you retire if you don't have any cash will\n... the answer you don't number three appreciation\nWe all look real estate against the stock market and the only number they count is appreciation\nSo their concept is is it real estate appreciates it like six or seven percent a year over the last hundred years and the stock market was appreciated by twelve percent per year over the last hundred years and by the way of making up both of those numbers but it's the kind of hogwash that they tell you\nAnd so most people when they buy real estate there they have this theory location location location they want to buy real estate and a good neighborhood because they think it's going to go up appreciate faster\nCause some bad neighborhoods don't appreciate all summer appreciate one two three percent really good neighborhoods might appreciate six seven eight percent and some super hot air is a country might or subdivisions or\nCities or whatever some some market might appreciate as much as Fifteen Percent which would be just abnormal type of appreciation\nSo when they compare and they said you that\nThe stock market has always outperform real estate they're using only that one type of return which is appreciation now something we can do that you can't do which is number four is something called forced appreciation force depreciation is where\nYou take something and you will prove it\nAnd you force it to go up in value so we might go out there by the apartment complex for a million dollars renovated for a hundred thousand dollars and because of the renovations it's now worth two million and\nGranted we put twenty five percent down on a million dollar deal putting two hundred fifty thousand dollars put it a hundred thousand ... three hundred fifty thousand but we've just made it go up in value to two million we've got a million one in it that means we just made nine hundred thousand dollars on a three hundred and fifty thousand dollar investment\nThat is a little shy of three hundred percent I don't see any appreciation like that type of ... going on in anything but real estate\nWill take a short break here if you'd like to call in and interrupt this conversation we have two more ways you can make money in real estate our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven if you'd like to comment otherwise when we come back we've got two more reasons that real estate out performs all their investments food right back with the devil wants a radio\nShow [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio show will be back with more life changing as opposed to justify\n\nYou know that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money five wave cash flow of money in your pocket each equity capture a thousands of dollars you ... when you have the right team and vital white property using the right mass appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nMath appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nEquity filled a ... page on your mortgage each month\nAnd finally the tax advantage when done correctly real estate investors\nPay no taxes on our cash flow and capital gains lifestyles unlimited these are the five ways we make

did the aluminum siding on their house and he told Marie and Gloria levine I'm going to be a stand up and he told them a joke about it\nIn a sense of this was my first one to me there's always room for one on the news you can find an egg\nSo he tells them that you can get from this car and drives away and this is a living goes Murray Hill never make it\nWhen he was out of show business working this square gig as a woman Saudi salesmen and living in the suburbs and going on the road and taking orders lining up contractor continued to write jokes and he kept a\nDuffel bag in his bedroom at

stint in comedy a failed marriage and no money in the bank Rodney return to the comic circuits at the age of forty but the struggles along with his maturity made Rodney a better comedian stage name on the other hand jak Roy was lacking\nShe went to the cloud that he had worked in the past and um and the club owner always ran the names and they act and then writing print them in the air\nWasn't sure he is very loud so instead of using the name jak arranging told the club owner and manager make a name\nSo he made up a name broadly Dangerfield\nHe's starting to say and listen to me that the price for the name was Rodney Dangerfield in them but I never went family well that night I\nCan't help people and he thought maybe maybe that name so it can kind of became is lucky charm\nThe name change helped to buck the angry guy routine also needed to make over\nFirst thing he came up with what you mean nothing goes right and\nThen when you know I'm not going to work so and then he would write jokes accordingly to that every\nRodney new routine was working\nEarning him bookings in more prestigious\nVenue but at the age of forty four\nRodney knew he needed more exposure from New York there was no better venue at the time and the Ed Sullivan show what are known to audition\nSo Rodney audition in Nineteen sixty six any killed it puts Sullivan\nProved to be harder to win over to sort of
