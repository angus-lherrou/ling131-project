trying to cover the sad sad story of why the common person out there or can't get ahead in life and what the weird perceptions they have about the world\nAnd weaknesses they have is a human being that keep them from coming successful were doing case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early in life he's changed his\nHis skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah\nOf societies and which were protected logical advancements\nAnd he has not been able to keep up now on the picket backup where he says he just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers background I was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money whereas all that money\nWhy Disney on five ten Fifteen houses what in the apartment complex where's all the money\nSee this is the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job at better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend in you earn and you spend your earnings bending you're not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they've chewy ... up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke right if you shoot horses back then you had a great job or business now you're broke\nSee everything changes constantly\nYou either have to change with it or you have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about what society goes\nOf those items work so it goes on and says that was a ... social media became popular and now people can share their ideas on line without needing a programmer or hire a cheaper and more jeopardy would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran\nJeopardy would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran again again it wasn't a business it was a job I change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal does you know what uh type a personality as somebody who will throw mud on the wall hope something sticks he changes his mind or her mind\nOver and over and over again they start a thousand projects finished none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are they're just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what has he done to invest in the future and why should he deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that outlook\nGoes on and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that has high demand\nTo think about that statement I now the year I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile\nIs that not complete and total giving up\nI mean that's just I gave up I needed skilled is so low that no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so terrible\nThat I'll be saving right\nSo what did you do since I became a truck driver push I'm currently doing and love it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you still be broke you'll see still be looking for another job and you know\nUntil they make guys it clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe they'll make a robotic limbs till Sunday then you lose a job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck I've driven trucks before mass of solitude no competition\nNo argumentation nobody to deal with\nYou just sit there by yourself in total solitude don't have to interact with the world boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nIt goes on and says here's the reason for this email I hear you on the radio recently stating that you are expanding nationwide and opening up new officers in other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need\nI just wonder if you grow so large and add thousands of do preferred members that your second deal\nThat the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds due to so many people doing going after it\nWell my friend that's already true\nGood deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand people the deals are going to be sucked up\nRight but the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there of you believe in the zero sum game reality of the world you believe for me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else\nAnd that there's not enough dollars to go around that simply isn't true\nAnd I'm a cover it after I finish a paragraph here says or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business models that millions of advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments since they will be bought before you\nCan even see it I'll let me tell you a little secret no one's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate it gives back\nIt has the abundance mentality and believes it doesn't have to have all of the business\nIt believes that can give it away to its customers lettuce customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been a Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all of us real so I could talk people embarrassing and me I get on billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of me taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and earn the millions and we help them do that no corporation in America to be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why\nBecause I've already rich before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people that way right most people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want to make money\nI go to work every day because I Want to help people and I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there\nI go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work\nA once a month or two a two day just so I stay involved with my members and know that the message is still tight\n... so you think another corporation is going to allow somebody to do that I don't think so and so your premises wrong from there but it's even more wrong in another way which I'm going to cover when we come back from this next break because that lack mentality lack mentality that you are carrying\nIt so absolutely wrong and opposite of the abundance mentality that you should have to be successful I'm going to make a statement and that is is if you do not have the abundance mentality you will never have done is we write back with the Dell wants and radio show [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals now the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals now here's a reality\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done about before\nSo that part is why we went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years\nStill doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now would you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles we still haven't even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratch the edge of the market because there's\nSo many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in years to three thousand dollars three thousand San Antonio and Austin\nAnd that's only just taxes that's not counting Midler it's not counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi\nEt cetera et cetera so you're the point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil left\nTwenty years and that's it will be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there was a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in each of fucking fact there's probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just do one state and yet we still believe we have an oil now\nWe believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people as we have in taxes in every other state and union they're still being a business from to do that and that will be Ken lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all of that said were they being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email my\nPoint you is how sad is that for him because here he is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer were just something not everyone is willing to do that is the demand will always be high\nThere it is the only thing you can get rich doing is being a doctor a lawyer a thing that which most of us are not willing to do\nOr he just nailed it for himself didn't he hey I'm happy that I'm not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not willing to either go do something you would put me in a position that couldn't be copied or number to stick with anything and get better at it\nI should have got better at electronics I should have got better at programming but I didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a truck driver\nWow he goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this since it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip\nThink about it every money making opportunities he spoke of was about work\nIt was about labor it was about doing something to somebody else\nDoesn't want to do and it's that belief system which is killing them think about it if you would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate\nThat houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there\nPeople are still living in them I don't know because I'm like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business\nSo I went from houses to duplex is the four Plex his to small apartments to medium size apartments to large apartment\nI progress my skills that knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class a apartment I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff all eventually the old too old to using the new stuff I'll have to understand so I have to be on the cutting edge that's what a class say is you got to be in the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards he wants\nTo trade time for money secondly he has no assets the businesses we own have assets\nAs inflation occurs our assets go up and down as income goes up rents go up the acid value goes up\nWe keep growing he keeps having to pay more money his job income gets watered down by inflation our asset values get increased by inflation my friends this gentleman's life\nHas been lived behind the prism of negativity a failure\nAnd we don't know if there's any possibility that you can never be saved he's asked for help and I took this email today live this morning and I'm given to back alive today I Hope he's listening to a short break we'll be
