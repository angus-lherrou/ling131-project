days ago and you know man a bag full of just when they got my dream pulled out of my stomach boy that hurt\nAnd uh now I'm ready to just tear it up again and you know as I've been out I've noticed in I've stopped drinking about three or four weeks ago so now I'm like totally bored or you know normally I Would come in five o'clock and have a couple of drinks relax or watching TV\nBut if you don't drink it to the racing thing TV has no interest whatsoever\nAnd it started bringing back memories of\nWhat I used to be and how I got to be so successful both as a physical as an athlete than later as a business person is that you know my brain goes a thousand miles an hour and it doesn't want to stop it\nIs that you know my brain goes a thousand miles an hour and it doesn't want to stop and there's really you know the reason I started drinking was to bring about the ability to slow the brain down at night so that I could just relax and not care and not carrying a such a simple thing to do and I don't know how the rest of you do it\nUm where you slow yourself down or do you want to slow yourself down\nBut I'm the reality is is that there's so much more you can have in life it'd be just don't do that so sometimes stop drinking it's interesting 'cause when I first did it I couldn't sleep at all had about an hour's sleep at night\nNow I'm sleeping while you are but I'm Still getting up early and I'm getting a lot of stuff done early while I'm energetic and so forth but also I'm finding myself where normally shutting myself down by five o'clock have my drinks relax um\nNow my gosh what am I going to do a wide awake I'm not going to shut myself to announce I'm past the point of that feel that it's time to shut myself down um I've been off the alcohol now about three and a half weeks and the reality is is that I don't miss it at all I Know I never did I Know that when I drank drank because I wanted to\nNot because I had to I did it because I wanted to solve myself down but what I didn't realize that this was an interesting point I used to make this point on type about smokers you know and if you point one finger forward you can point three fingers back at

and now here's some more conventional wisdom sets you free the man on a mission to retire America One version at a time while I'm walking\nBack to do on the radio show today we're talking about your personal growth\nArgue growing are you doing anything about it or you're coming home at night after living this life require desperation coming home at night and just powering yourself\nTurning your light bulb off at night watching TV becoming brain dead you realize when you get off of work with every time you get off the by the time you get home and you eat dinner there still three or four or five hours left at night you can get something done\nI Would suggest to you that what you need to do is you need to start thinking about investing in yourself before you start investing money out here we're going to talk about investing money today to do get wrong we're going to get to that but before you spend any time going out there in investing money I think you need to invest money in education for yourself\nWhat types of education I think you need to know so far the cage and the motivation\nYou know where do you want to be in life what do you want to be alive wherever you go in your life you know you hear this over and over and over again but like I said until I got up the alcohol and said okay look I've already where I Want to be that's a very easy thing to say\nI Am a piece of garbage middle class human being I have a decent job I have a decent car I have a decent home I have a decent this kid's blah blah blah I was listening to a park yesterday\nA Youtube video the guy\nA public speaker and uh he was talking about the fact that he believed that poor people in his definition the poor was anybody that wasn't rich and poor people are greedy and selfish individuals\nThat is deposition is the explanation was pretty interesting you said you know poor people are all about me me me and uh that's about as selfish is going to be what can I earn what is my pay check where do I live what do I drive\nHowever my kids what grades do my kids yet he said if you ever heard any more sickening and cry baby ... self centered as that\nThey were hurting more sickening and cry baby ... self centered is that instead of what can I Do to improve the world what can I Do to grow my resources to where I have enough to give away\nAnd he's talking about rich people are way way way\nNicer than poor people now that is so different than what you believe but I'll tell you this if you go to a poor person's house and you meet their kids and their family and the wife and hugs and you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial information sometimes even with each other\nAlmost always not with their kids their kids learn nothing about finances because their parents won't talk about him because the parents are embarrassed about what they're doing with their money\nThey are not growing a family legacy they are piling a little bit of money into an account hoping that some day we'll get them by in the darkest moments of their life to survive\nThey are planning for mere survival they're already living a life of quiet desperation now they're planning for a life of mere survival\nWe're is the abundance in that\nPoint of view can you share that with me wherever it is there something about wow my family is going to have a wonderful life because I Want them\nBecause I Want to go and have the ability to help my church I Want to have the ability to help other people like it lifestyles at thirty five thousand clients\nMany many many of which you've already retired hundreds maybe thousands of them have retired uh how many people more can I help how can I make help quicker faster better\nThose are the kinds of things that millionaires get up and think about how can we do more faster and better for those people out there\nNo worry about ... comes back to me because it's going to come back to me\nIf I put enough out there in the universe the universe is going to bring enough back to me if you do right now have enough going on in your life to make you where do you want to be or if you're not where you want to be you're not putting enough out their guys you're not out there putting it out making it happen creating activity in your life\nYour circle of influence is a symbol\nOf the world\nNow every time you buy something and you invest in something an asset of business you now have influence over a larger group of people\nAnd you make their lives better if you've ever read out do have a nice red house or people happy there have you influenced their\nHappiness if we have an apartment complex hundreds of people are they happy there have you influenced their happiness are you out there producing happiness in the world\nSo that you can and return receive your uh bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot or any other one of the middle east hundreds of politicians you could just look at right now you could go down to listen go idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot I don't know how we elect people\nI think we go the dumber they are the better chance of them getting elected\nBut what's worse is not only do you like to eat each you sit and listen to 'em like they actually know something those guys no nothing they will not help you or your family\nGet where you want to be there out there to stop you from getting where you want to be that's what government does the government doesn't help you\nIt stops you it takes away from you steal from you it doesn't help you in any way shape or form a\nGovernment by pure nature is something that has to suck in not give out\nRight so why do you spend all your time paying attention to these idiots it doesn't make any sense right so what should you pay your attention to you should be paying your attention to those things which will help to expand the universe\nAnd return those positive will bring back to you and your family to do that you have coming to you from putting out all these positive things in the world\nBut you can't do that if you go home at night and shell out in front of the TV you can't go home at night adjust crash yourself down with alcohol like I was doing for a couple of years that doesn't work there's no way you're at the end the second you pick up the bottle and start drinking it's done for the day\nPeriod you're over I Know I did it and\nYou would ask me well why don't you stop all my ... I don't want\nTo stop gee I could admit to myself as a millionaire is actually a multi millionaire I'm not going to call myself a mega multimillionaire but multimillionaire in excess of\nHow it was very happy with who are out of that money is coming in businesses are working everything's operating they'll say well why kids' eyes sixty to just sit back and relax and the answer is I'm not really sitting back and relaxing what I'm doing is pickling myself\nYou were born to live my question is are you living\nNow I'm not asking you to go out there work don't get me wrong this is not about work this is about investing and growing your password strings\nOf income so that your family can go where do where we'll take a short break be right\nBack with a woman [noise] [noise]\nI don't want it there\nI wanted a deal I Want to buy more income\nSo let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest you could tell that's incredible I could live out that the rest of all I'd go no no that's terrible\nThe rate of return on that investment is terrible\nNow I go out and buy an apartment complex\nI met in the process of by one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you to understand who's just takes zeros off of all this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income\nIn addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month\nIn income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes that makes up a little bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around ... fifty times twelve a six hundred thousand dollars but it's paying down the mortgage\nAnother two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nNow what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight\nAnd in addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars with the deductions right out of the blocks the ride off gets my other incomes and other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year\nTo almost a million a year in income the hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the million a year it's tax free you know what I'm Trump doesn't want to show his tax returns 'cause he make billions tax free you my friend every time you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting it into four one K. and the Ira you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you had to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nEntered it with no taxation so you look at a family\nAnd he said we're should your money ...\nShould your money be at some places you know when you go to your financial plan as we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eighty years old Ninety years old me they're really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down in the principal and the other two percent but what did you could earn ten percent now\nI'm not even throwing in there all the other ways ... income for example when we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and\nWe have immediate income from that we call that force\nAppreciation force appreciation is massive it\nIt's wraps around the rule the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the improvement of the property critic twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment or act when he's only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investment a hundred percent gain on your investment can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent a year\nOut that's unbelievable we also have that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rent just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that well your money sitting there and it's the inflation is depreciating your money\nWe have the tax advantage of depreciation and the other one is when we do see these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money out tax free\nTax free and you understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars and pay no taxes on whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nYou are living in a life of quiet desperation mediocre life and you're living by a set of rules that are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're stuck there\nIs because you are numbing yourself out at whatever level you're living at right now whatever it is that you get up today and said I Am me I Am proud to be\nWhat I'm saying is don't be proud to be you be proud to be the man you are becoming\nI Am proud to be the man I Am becoming I'm happy with what I've done so far I'm satisfied but I'm not done we'll take a short break be right back with the ...\n[noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio show will be

are his are going\nAnd so when I was a bit when I Would do the voice so just kind of do the [laughter] and I would get I wouldn't be doing it ... to get into character to get the voice sounding right
