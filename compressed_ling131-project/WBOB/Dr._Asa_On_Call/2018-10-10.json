B. here this is Dan slice\n\nWill get back you know here's some more conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire American one version and there's no one will go\nBack to do on the radio show with me here today is mark ... best you're out of Huntington Beach California or the first segment mark was go uh sharing with us how he jumped at the business on his own uh had a couple of properties that accumulated with his wife and mother and now we're change the subject overdue how'd you find does\nAnd what were the you're the process you went through to get involved with us\nI think back at the time I was trying to learn what I could about managing the single family homes in the fourth place we had and so I was\nLooking on I think I tunes one day and looking for a pod cast than I came upon the lifestyles unlimited pod cast and I started listening to that I have about a twenty five minute commute to school in the morning\nAnd rather than listening to music I always enjoy something that's going to teach me since I started lifting the lifestyles and eventually after listening for quite a while I I joined um as an F F P member and\nWas able to access the online\nCourses including the two days seminar and so sort of went from there\nSo would you took the to do something that I took it over the Internet I assume on the first time around and what did you get out of it the first time around that was a different to what you thought what you know what was the ... which we like to say\nYeah I think there are there are two main things is set up for me ah one was that uh I had heard on the podcast that if you properly learn how to screen your tenants that Ninety eight percent or somewhere around there have you timed it problems can be avoided altogether\nAnd so uh I've managed property for probably about Fifteen Years now and and for the most part I've done a pretty good job of that after learning\nHow to properly screened tennis but I you know my one nightmare tennis that I had a I have to take responsibility for was really the fact that I did not screened correctly and I got somebody in there that you would\nRefer to as a purple Martian and was created a lot of stress and tension during the time that that time it was then there are so that was one of the ... and then I think really the ... the first time I took it on line\nOh so that was one of the ... and then I think really the second the first time I took it on line was just the whole idea of lifestyles um creating\nUm best product a price and so\nIn our four Plex that we had when we had a tenant move out we would totally redo the unit and get it back to you know top notch um condition and three of the four units in that building have been totally redone now the fourth unit has had attendant in there for so long that we haven't had to\nHave the ability to turn it over yet but I think those were the two main things that that\nI learned that was back in two thousand Thirteen\n\nOr actually started taking actions and then it was all the way until two thousand Eighteen you upgrade your membership let's walk through the process\nThat you went through that I think it was like three steps you went to this than to this than it is the kind of change your mind that you wanted to do more what is your step is through that process\nOkay uh well I think the first thing I did is I I Want to my wife to be on board with this and so she and I went out to Palm Springs I think it was back in January and they had a meat del event\nAnd we had a chance to meet you and to hear from Brian deferred and I wanted her to sort of understand what lifestyles unlimited was all about and then the following month I we went back to the two day in Palm Springs and uh she came with me along with my father in law and\nAre really going through the two day in person I had a couple of other\nAha moments and one of the biggest one was that you know I had these homes in Southern California that we're starting to build up a fair amount of equity because I don't want them for Fifteen Years\nBut that equity wasn't a helping me in any way it was just sitting there I wasn't getting any kind of a benefit or any kind of cash flow out of that\nSo one of the biggest a ha moment for me as I Know that you have a lot of people do the calculation where you look at your net worth and you figure out you know what percent are you making off of your network and uh when I figured that out at ... whether\nYou know it wasn't that great so I thought there needs to be something I can do to change and I figured if I figure out a way to unlock some of the equity in these properties and read a play at that I can probably shave I'm thinking maybe seven or so years off the end of my teaching career\nUm and so that was probably my biggest ... going to be a two day in person\nYeah excuse me in that situation when you look at it that how about the second day\nYou know now that you took it live you took it was before the Internet now you live ... what a ha moments you up in the second day 'cause you haven't been mentioning that so much you arrange with\nButter or a couple of things right there are a couple of things um one is that when I took the seminar live I had the opportunity to actually meet people that were invested in deals and so when you hear something on the radio sometimes [noise]\nYou know you haven't talked to somebody flesh and blood is actually doing these um deals and so one of the first people I met in Palm Springs was Steve Anderson who is our Southern California ambassador that I'm working with\nIn lifestyles and he was just a real easy to get to know person who reached out to me answered questions um he was in I think seven multifamily deals at the time so I said oh I'm actually talking to somebody that's in\nThese multifamily deals that I'm hearing about I'm\nAlso had the opportunity to meet caring and Dan Tucker who are are ambassadors in Southern California as well but I think looking at the multi family the second day as I've heard a lot of people say I'm you know you realize that you can actually\nHave forced appreciation when you get a multi family property so you can buy a property that is\nMaybe a little down and out how some room for improvement you can infused some capital into that you can\nReally fix it up Redskin rise the ah occupancy can rise and then because the value of that building is going to be a a multiple of the net operating income you can basically create value there and the idea of being a passive investor for me\nIn a property like that where I could potentially create a a bigger return or be a part of somebody else creating this return um that was very very appealing to me\nWhile I wanted to ask you this question and ever since I knew I was going to interview you kind of a trick question but\nWhat about the bad you're a bad teacher did the math not just blow you away when you looked at the fact that the larger about it back when you had to lower the rate of return\nThat refinancing actually raised the rate of return that the ability to refinance or pull all your money I created infinite rates of return uh what about all that math as a math teacher did that not just blow your mind\nThat the shuttle lay out or intuitive\nYes it is and in fact it's it's funny because the properties that we held I never actually took the time to do the math on time I didn't really look at it that way I said well I have this property and makes me X amount per month and that sort of the end of it and I didn't really look at well there's this much on the property and this is the ... percent return I'm getting\nA which I probably you know whether that I couldn't do the math but I probably didn't know the correct way to approach or thinking about that\nBut yeah one of the things that my other aha moment on the two days seminars is the idea that you just mentioned of getting an infinite return and so when I heard about deals where people would invest in an apartment complex and you know they would\nMaybe have value play or a a hybrid play and two three four years down the line\nWould be able to refinance and pull their initial capital out and ah sometimes up to a hundred percent or more and so basically you have no more money in that deal and yet you're still going to receive you know you're eight percent\nNine percent sometimes a return on that deal with no money left in there and now you can take the money you got back and you can go invested in another property um that really blew me away and and\nI think that's very nice to read anything I think that's a great place to take a break we'll be right back with mark totally and the ... radio show\nA bit out of nowhere\nHard like eight or ten deals right on my plate just boom boom boom boom boom they're just they're they're out there they're all over the place is just a matter of getting involved with it um\nSince you've started I Know there's no most of these deals don't pay off in the first couple of months so we won't go into returns let's talk about your plan into the future what do you see and how do you see your plan developing here\nWell I'm I like I said I could be if I worked until I was sixty five I could be teaching for another\nYou know nine years and I'm thinking that um as I mentioned earlier maybe I can shape seven years or so off of that so I'm thinking I may work for another year or two and my really my plan in the meantime has to\nRead the play as much money as I can out of these other properties that we have an addition to the house we just sold we also or refinanced our other single family home um about three or four months ago and I was able to already take that money and that's part of it allowed me to get into some of these other deals\nAnd so I really my goal is to get as much money working for me as possible in the mall type family\nUm arena and try to create a path of income that's going to sort of sit on top of a what I get from my state teachers' retirement so I've been teaching Thirty years so I Will get some kind of a retirement I'm from doing that and then I'm I'm hoping that once I\nGet all this set up then I'll be able to you know keep and maybe even increase my standard of living compared to what I've been doing um as a full time worker\n\nOkay let's talk about how you introduce his two children\n\nOkay uh well I looked at it and I thought you know if I had really always says well if I would've known that I Know now Twenty years ago Thirty years ago you know I Know lifestyles one of their monitors as you know retire and five years or less and I I Believe that's totally possible [laughter]\nAnd so I look at uh my kids who are both in middle school I have a sixth grade boy and an eighth grade girl and I want them to have options as they're growing up and so I thought well how can I sort of start to introduce the idea of real estate investing to them and one of the things that I did as a teacher as I sort of created a\nA two page sheet that had properties specifications and just all the important information that somebody would need to know pretty basic information about um apartment complexes and the first deal I got in with a rubber McCain as I had both my daughter Katie and my son Josh\nFill out a form that included you know what was the purchase price how much cash where they raising what year was a building build what are the amenities and all that kind of thing and then we took a look at they actually went through the ... pm I did they didn't read the OPM but they\nHad certain pages where they would find out what what are the returns supposed to be in the first couple of years and ... there [noise]\nUm you know expectation down the line as far as doing a refinance or a a you know a sale in the future and I I actually took and my mother when\nMy kids were born at given them each two thousand dollars to go toward their college fund and I was supposed to put it in a five twenty nine plan or something like that and I never got around to that and it finally hit me a\nFew months back that you know let me let them get into my deals and so the deal that I invested with Robert Martinez I teach my kids um invest a thousand dollars into that deal unofficially of course they're not official owners and uh [noise]\nSo they're they're tracking that with me I'm Robert sends out knife um videos showing what they've done on the rehab on the property we got so I watched that with the kids and we discuss\nUm just the different aspects of the deal and they're sort of excited because they're actually in the deal and I said as long as you're interested and you know you can remain in this and we'll keep learning if you ever say I don't want to do this any more than I'll give you a thousand dollars back that we invested in this deal and and we'll just go from there but my daughter has\nYou know she's learned quite a bit she's a pretty smart girl and she's learned about depreciation in Texas I'm covering the income better than it does in California so she knows that and she's been talking about that and my son Josh asking me questions like so if we get if\nThey do a refinance and they get a Seventy five percent return on the refinance\nIs that in addition to the money that you initially invested so he's trying to sort of figure out or you just getting Seventy five percent back of what you put in to start with and I thought no this is on top of what you put in so you know they're asking questions and they're involved in the process and I think that that's\nUm hopefully give no options in the future and not just you know settle into the typical thing of of working at a job for forty five years\nYou know I really like what you've done it by the way I've got to\nDo a disclaimer here because I read through your your documents are folks the kids don't actually own one percent of the property\nWhat they've done is they've set up a non binding contract almost like a dummy company for these kids to belong to to be able to follow along as if they actually had ownership they can't have ownership until they're Eighteen years of age you listen to the trust of some type\nOf but it's a good learning curve in the second point like ... if you\nEver get bored and have nothing to do\nI Would love for you to pencil out that program for us so the coal could work\nWith you and create a kids' program we would try to find somebody understands kids and be able to teach for a long time was short break we'll

that way [noise]\nUh I was just shocked kid in high school but never wanted to talk to people even if I knew your real well I wouldn't know open up that much of a lot of people thought you know hey

to me today versus me Thirteen Years ago a\nComplete different personal I mean I as far as our middle talking to people going up and meeting people\nI'm a lot more apt to do that now part of that because I'm older and I'm growing up and I\nIn business and you learn these things but part of it's because I didn't have an option\nAnd she just wants me to differ on earth absolutely I mean there there are things about her personality that if I could just\nTake an implant in my belt I Would do it tomorrow\nYou know we met so many people we never would have met if we didn't have her we'd have relationships with people that we never would have that were not for\nThe daily ... came to mind their family that we met basically through our\nOur babysitters nanny [noise]\nUh she worked for us all the time she was actually a student teacher at the school that we went to in Jackson [noise]\nAnd then she started coming over to the house after school\nTo try to come over the house after school and keeping the girls are a little bit and then she'd keep 'em whenever we'd go to an event or something like that what she ended up coming over a lot like even when we didn't necessarily need a meter we wanted to kind of keep her busy and keep her because she was so good with the girl she just\nShe came from a really good family they really had a heart for it you know taking care of them being you know\nMindful of that she was in college you have an\nShe played soccer ... times you've come help us and so our parents come to town to watch her play soccer and they want to meet with a person you

[noise] you know you you you segregated these kids out and you didn't have any interaction so I don't think they even know how to go about trying to make that happen now for the most part\nBut now since a lot of these schools are inclusive and they do include kids and everything you know I Do kids grow up and go into the community [noise]\nIf for no other reason there'll be used to it and there'll be more progressive and they'll try to get these kids involved and you know maybe they can't do anything but [noise]\nWe agreed or at a restaurant or you know maybe they're limited in certain

I went through twenty five thousand teens entire history of sports in the Eighteen eighties over the world and I got down to Seventeen about\nAnd you know the first thing I looked at was talent right I thought talent will be the thing and you have to realize that some of these teams they all are talented but some of them had talented was clearly average or even mediocre in some cases so isn't that\nThe second thing I thought was coaching you know it's gotta be coaching but to my great surprise\nThere wasn't a pattern there I'm not saying coaching isn't important but some of these teams had more than one coach you know they changed coaches or you know son didn't even have coaches coaches who really didn't take an active role and in fact\nOnly one of them how to coach who was considered a great coach when they're run a dominant began so that wasn't the magic bullet I was looking for I also looked at things like tactics\nYou know I thought maybe they just had incredible brilliant strategies that stood out above the rest of it again and only a handful of them could say that so that wasn't a pattern either\nBill Russell was relentless and I mean to an extreme he would get sick before every\nGame they play in meaningless she would throw up in the locker room and he in fact that we didn't draw because he made a rush to go for a law fuck what's wrong with you or because he cares so much but the code play was a perfect example of why this matters now\nThis happened in the ... season and they made the NBA Finals and the game seven against the St Louis hawks and\nThis was the first game sevens and it was just a huge fan of the credible pressure and Russell is a rocky now\nLate in the game a boss and a one point Lee is on a minute left and Boston ... down and Russell charge found the court and he tried to dump all this stuff this tiny mess\nAnd St Louis got the rebound and St Louis affording jak Coleman had been sort of hanging back behind the play and they quickly inbound or the Baltimore md core I have that many court with a ball and a running start\nNow Russell who had missed that Doug where was he he was underneath his own basket off the court\nOn the other side he was like Ninety six tea from the basket and Coleman was probably about forty five feet with the wrong dark\nBut when it came to the ram and to make a lay up now this is late in the game they would have taken a lead it might have in the end this blur appeared behind him swat at the ball and it was Russell and he somehow covered twice the distance that Coleman had in the same amount of time\nI mean nobody on in that arena where we're thought he had a chance and certainly must side of the non self but just that raw desire that he demonstrated over and over again in competition the thing about it and that was just it for him and what we don't understand is that studies have shown that\nRelentlessly is highly contagious you know if a group of people in and do something together thinks that one person in that group is giving a hundred percent effort are real maximum effort now all of them will raise their own performance\nIf you have someone in your mid like that who was relentless and committed to playing at all times at a hundred percent\nThey're going to be serious marginal gains that you will you will see in your team work and\nThat's just not something we can quantify so it's not something that we teach but I think it's about time we start\nWe've all been around people who have that kind of drive and focus on what it does do our deem we raise our game we raise the bar and when those people aren't present we don't even know where the bar is\nFresh exactly [noise] yeah I Know it's funny because there's some emotions that are contagious group and\nRelentless contagious always in a good way tough is always contagious sneak away he showed toughness and\nPerseverance others will too and another one is emotional control or something all these leaders had they had the ability to overcome really difficult personal circumstances and\nNot just compete will compete in at a higher level than ever and Tom Brady oh the patriots did a great example this you know a couple of seasons go after this whole deflate gate situation and he served as suspension but he came back and\nPlayed one of his greatest seasons but even after they won the Superbowl this incredible comeback against the Atlanta Falcons\nWe find out that his mother had been undergoing chemotherapy you know and they had been diagnosed with cancer season so he was going through that and he never said a word about no one knew about it\nAnd because he had the control to put that away and to play as hard as he could win his plane deal with pepper Leon\nNo doubt and we're going to get to breeding and a little bit because it's such a fascinating chapter in your book but let's talk about one more basketball player 'cause I don't think he gets the credit he deserves Tim Duncan San Antonio spurs talk about Tim Duncan who is\nShe is a very unusual guy he was a great swimmer I really had an incredible talented maybe even been an Olympic swimmer but you know the hurricane came in and destroy the local pool and I bought the same time his mother passed away and\nYou had these hard knocks and then we started taking a basketball and was very lightly recruited in fact weight forces right on the schools that really took seriously very skinny kid and just hadn't grown into his body\nBut you know he he got there and really matured and became a really hot and the prospect but yeah I don't think anyone really thought that that he was going to become the star that he was already that he would develop skills or he did but\nThe thing that's fascinating about tender there's two things I think there's so much about him that his truck different leaders but I think the the most important thing really is the way he played and I had the talent to dominate the NBA in terms of scoring you know on the stand the Scalia statistics but\nIf you look at his total it's really amazing switch telling you if she was very prolific score some years it was not his blocks and rebounds and other things we're we're off the charts she would change his position on the court and play different positions the pending on the makeup of the teen\nIt just showed that you had the same quality that Russell had which is that he ... he didn't care what numbers were what you thought of him or whether he got on the cover a magazine he only cared about the team winning and he would do whatever grunt work needed to be done and he would change his role to fit\nBut the thing about Tim Duncan that really every once in a study in the way to Munich and I was completely ...\nIt wants to study in the way to Munich and\nI was completely surprised when I looked at these cats is because the first thing I thought the first way that you know to the team is is with the speech he gave a big speech right you motivate them with words and none of these cats and gave speeches and they did not like to do with someone purposely avoided it\nAnd I did not understand that I didn't understand how they communicate effectively the same as I went right to dunk to get to see their watched him to give an interview you know she is not\nA charismatic guy he sounds like he's getting a cold and asking the same question you just had no motion you monitor slapstick riding doesn't come across as a charismatic person so how to communicate well she talks a lot but it's a different sort of communication he's always working the room\nTalking individually to one person one on one incredible intense the stairs uses his eye contact and gestures and touch to communicate very tense with people and he listens as much as he talks and who I'm sure he listens and\nHe had his interacts has all the time and he has them in the moment especially when someone has done something wrong or me courage spent twenty strings attached and\nWhen I realized that the spurs talk more than any team I've ever seen and they're always talking on the floor on the bench conflict communication and this creates an atmosphere everyone\nFeels like they can contribute to feel heard and they also feel like they have to account for themselves and all the problems that she had or addressed in the moment nothing ever faster as talkative style that they had allowed them to address problems in the moment in the past and\nThat's why they were so good for so long that's why they made the playoffs and Nineteen consecutive seasons for the credible revolving cast of players\nAnd won five ten and she had the greatest long term already percentage and NBA history it was because that the whole climate that Duncan created you know allow them to fly new people and got them talking and solve the problem is so even though it didn't always have the best talent or\nCertainly not the most money they were the most dominant team of of their hair and the NBA\nAnd we're talking with Sam Walker author of the captain class I Want a terrific series the stats for Tim Duncan wherever you might put them in the pantheon grace Nineteen consecutive playoff five championships and the best winning percentage in National Basketball association fishery\nBy the way if you like what we do\nHere on our American story

creation of Lambert tenacious style as aggressive clay and his relentless\nJak glamour was a player who had an understanding of something that all these easily captains new to some extent but I think he was probably the best example of it\nThey understood the power of non verbal communication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed it\nOn verbal communication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed to do something\nIn full view their team it that would show their level of commitment a passion that were transferred to them and allow them to play hard and\nJak labor was famous of course for a new you lost a couple of teeth in high school playing pickup basketball any uh had it for ... ... that he wore in public but he would take it off\nOn the field so they end up toothless [noise] you know mouth and he would scare people so that was part of it but\nMy favorite jak laboratory that I think shows you the genius of his leadership was that they were playing a game of Nineteen Seventy six and they had won the super bowl but they started wandering for\nPeople that are written them off like it's over for the Steelers and they had to win this and they had to beat the Bengals and\nHe was playing uh probably the five game as career in terms of number tackles the recovered fumbled basically accounted for most of the teams points singlehandedly so it wasn't a credible game but not in the middle of the game he\nHad a came to the game you gotta cut on his hand and he managed to get up and you know he went out there and of course the band just failed in the blood starts burning out it was all over his uniform as pets I mean he was a mess\nI tracked down one of the trainers I asked her why didn't you know you just reroute that bad there's when it came off the field are changes uniform and half time or something and you said\nYou're standing jak Lambert love having blows you know for me I understood how powerful that message was and how how much heart nations summit play and how much it to me is opponent and uh she eat to that on purpose and jak labor do all kinds of things that might seem create your own hands\nThe when you listen to talk about it and he always says he's calculated acts these were things that I did a you know on purpose because I understood the power they have in our study
