you can't jump because you're stuck you don't know where to go so we're talking about all three of these today are the two the stimulated conversation obviously my house and home renovation and the apartment complex renovations I'll start with the home renovation first of all a couple of weeks ago\nI woke up to the massive realization that again each and every year there is a certain amount of maintenance that must go on to maintain is super life and so although I have a super life here at this home beautiful mansion [noise]\nThe reality is is that I have to keep it up so had to come up with a plan there has to be a plan and there has to be a master plan\nAnd when I first moved here everything was dead and so my original plan was to plants this place up as a beautiful tropical garden\nAre you having issues with your roof Hi AJ Davis year after a strong storm last summer I noticed the shingles on my roof we're no longer on the road so I contacted my friend John about ...

B. O. B.\n\nWelcome back you know here's some more conventional wisdom sets you free the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time when you\nLook back to do on the radio show a today we're talking about how to take on big projects large turnaround situations and I'm Talking about my\nPersonal residents and also about apartment complex which is closed and also about your personal finances so the first step but so would you have to go ahead get sit down and look at your plan\nYour financial plan is wrong how do I know it's wrong\nWell was don't use the word wrong because Kobe doesn't like that are ... so that I'm right you're wrong that finger pointing that doesn't do any good so let's talk about effective yours is not effective are you living off fast food come so\nI'm so used to your plan doesn't work it's ineffective planned it does it give you what you want which is lots of money lots of free time\nAnd so you got to look at say what's wrong and you got to analyze it so as I Would analyzed my personal by the situation I Would look for income coming in can that be increased money going out can decrease the expenses that are in my life that are wasteful expenses\nThat aren't going to look at when I get on the income side you know what is by net worth doing for me what is the money in my house or to me which is nothing what does the forward cable there have\nBurning me and it's paying me nothing per month biracial pygmy nothing promote what do I have my savings account earning a quarter percent or half percent now days or two\nWhat is my buddy Dewey for me and the answer is it's doing absolutely nothing for you so what is the worst and most challenging are most important thing to do and that is do lose money ... money and if you're losing it if it's going out the door faster than you can bring it in\nYour not going to say it was so when I was doing landscaping situation [noise] my first priority was okay what am I losing what do I need I Need to stop the\nWhat is the most important thing to fix first there's a looked at my landscaping I realized that I was losing plants which is expensive to do in grass also\nI used that I was losing plants which is expensive to do in grass also\nBecause I wasn't getting enough water so I went around person here does I picked the area of my life that I wanted to work on which was my front yard ah actually it's the quarter ... yards and very small portion of my dry yard and I took that is that I got to master this quarter right here\nAnd so I looked at the sprinkler systems I saw there was to sprinkle heads are broken so I took him up put a new ones and solve that problem\nJak that also had an area that was flooded and so I turned a year that was flooded off completely\nAnd I put in low for water heads and said okay now when they turn is back on the area that's dry I'm going to put on higher for water heads so it gets more water in those areas 'cause obviously those areas needed it over here where it's a very tight area and there's too many heads almanac putting on low flow heads and saw down\nA\nThinking ahead at all solved right then\nI picked up the next thing you do if you're out there looking your finances you have to say okay let me start working on this one what do I do to fix that when you ... what YouTube has out there for you it's amazing what lifestyles has over here for you the information in life to become successful in whatever endeavor you're out to attack is out there somewhere\nGet your hands on so I'm going this stuff is spending our city up at night watching these videos and stuff or what's going wrong\nAnd what are they just made it very hobbies that I have not been feeding my grass in years past I fertilized my grass on a regular basis now\nBecause I broke my foot that I broke my ankle\nOr pushing my knee ... broke my elbow tore my price up off the last six months I had to build exercise at all which means there's no way I could get out there putting fertilizer and you can push the stupid cart and so\nI decided to start fertilizes thing up I started fertilizer luck put a little ... little we'd kill and all of a sudden the things started getting a little green but in the healthy areas were had not crowded out\nIt was becoming beautiful and thick go wild winning but over here in these areas it's it's not kidding me there yet and then I took it and read an article in the guy said you need to fertilize more often and I'm thinking you can't fertilizing the heat of summer it's going to kill the grass he talked about how to fertilize did not\nKill the grass in the heat of summer it talked about how to turn this thing around so I started fertilize it\nEvery week or just a little bit so that as that fertilizer got watered in and started to take effect I could put a little new fresh fertilizer on their little new weed killer on there to kill some bleach and slowly but surely over the next two weeks you could start to see a dramatic change in this part of the yard\nBut I still had the flooded out area I fixed theories that were due dry never worked starting to come back but the flooded out area or didn't I couldn't seem to fix it even though I put a low flow heads it was still getting too much water so I analyze the situation when I realized was there was actually a golly\nNow there is a\nRegular storm golly that goes along the front of my yard and sides my yard she goes to a creek you know runs out its natural but even within that goalie there was a low area so low that the water would just sit there couldn't get out of that area to go and follow the natural drainage trout\nAnd\nI thought I don't want to do instead of worrying about how to dig deeper I'll go dig deeper ditches and with the deeper ditches that maybe I could change the flow water and get it away from that area and I thought it would be easier than that why not just fill a hole in\nAnd so that's the next step to them and tries to go ahead and solve the problem but the whole it\nAnd the point I'm making is as you start to look at your situations financially we sit down with your work and we do on these things sometimes we're going to dig a little sometimes you're going to fill\nSometimes we have to fix things with a twist to the right sometimes with the tourists to laugh but we're taking just one part so for looking at you for when can we say what can we do to make it forward cable profitable for you\nWe have a lot of things to work on there and we are a lot of possibilities we can do with that money both inside before when care outside the four one K. they'll make a major difference\nBut we've got to take that four one K. apart mentally\nTo get to the point where it's actually going to make some difference and if we don't do that then we're not going to be able to solve the problem because the problem is going to be solved simply by\nDoing more what does it work in other words contributing war isn't going to make it happen that we're feeding the four one K.\nYou can actually overfeed something a lot of people putting money into their four one K. makes no sense at all because of putting in more than what the matches\nDoesn't make any sense to do that because for all case a retarded investments are way yes I said it retarded it's ridiculously stupid thing to do but if you're going to do it doing more of it is worse than doing less of it\nSo as we go to these battles each and every day would tear your four one K. situation apart would tear your personal residents situation part bull terrier earned income situation apart will look at your not exist as passionate income situation see where we can build some bathroom income\nEt cetera et cetera will look at your expense is your home expenses where are you wasting money you can save it start saving money so you can invest more\nAll of these different topics are part of working this process\nSo it's not just okay I'm going to go by red house and have some ... that is going to be a part of the process but that is not the entire process that is a part of the solution but\nIt is no way the process\nYour problem is the process is all wrong\nMy problem with my landscaping was my landscaping plan was all wrong\nIt was not sustainable in hundred and ten degree temperatures in the summer and twenty degrees freezing temperatures in the winter the plan was wrong and I had to fix the plan for I could start fixing the problems we'll be right back would you do on the radio show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nUm you know do we really need all that are just\nAll the stuff in your life that you wasted money it's just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often it and now it sounds a little bit towards like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense side of the equation now when I got back to my yard here\nAfter I had stabilize this front area had to let it sit for a couple of days a week or two and see what it would turn into I had to let the fertilizer take in fact\nI had to let the change of lawn chair companies take effect I had to let the change of a rotator heads on the sprinkler systems take effect [noise] um so I sat that went off the side as sort of watch it I made it a point every day to go out and watch it and look what's happening see what's going on\nAnd then it went on to my next his own\nAnd the next so it was truly a watering problem that the heads a sprinkler has one of them was buried underneath the plant there's growing like a hundred times the size originally planted that's all the sprinkler one time was on the edge of the bed or now it's you know ...\nSix foot under a plan so I had to trim the plant a waste of the Berkeley could get to the area\nA that was dead and another area that was dead because the sprinkler head or was not adjustable heads it wasn't hitting the area effectively a bit the head couldn't be adjusted so that has to be replacing it two or three of those out there with their heads and thirdly it was a gigantic area with three hundred and sixty degree rotary heads\nAnd they take a long time to get all the way round so you either got to leave the water running for a long time\nI'm fortunate for rotary three sixty road we had to get everything or you've got to increase the for water out of the rotary had well I Can't leave it running longer because they're in that same set of zoned there are a bunch of heads it only go a hundred and eighty degrees\nAnd so if you set it to quit your lawn sausage a hundred and eighty degrees and not over water the hundred and eighty degree once you end up under watering the three sixties\nSo now I have to go back out and take three sixty heads off and put more water and that so I can cut the whole thing backed out so I don't have the swamp in one area and a dry area these are things that\nCould not have been known when the program the process of originally designed or maybe they could have been but they were just you know they took the short cut and just did it the easy way but the bottom line is here I Am seven years later and I'd never took the time to figure this out because it wasn't until I lost control of my yard stopped fertilize mayor\nThat I got to the point where I could actually see how wrong these situations worsening my point of view is\nHow far does your finances have to go wrong before you wake up and say I need a new plan this one isn't working it's just not working\nHow long before you realize you have no positivity in your life\nWe move on to the next you know we went to the backyard where we planted took out all the tropical supplanted all these hedge is to get this what we call the English garden effect\nBox would you everywhere and we filled some of the zones with roses and they drift roses which was short little roast it looked beautiful we and others owns we put in an uh angels and and when we put the angels and they were beautiful but come back around this year again\nAnd all those angels are dead\nNow we've gone through this three years but now I don't have a landscaping company so for two months of bed sit there and there's nothing in the beds so finally we saw ready to go put some stuff in the bed right [noise]\nWell we found out was we're in the heat of the summer\nAnything you plant now will die by September all new plants that will survive the we're committed September and our plan in September and October so\nWe had to realize there is a timing to fixing certain things in your life\nThere is a timing in your life when you can get your money out of your four one K. effectively or more effectively or less effectively there's a timing when you can retire there's timing issue with when you and how you pay your bills and so on and so forth and so\nWe had to get involved with the timing issue the other thing we had to do was stop the bleeding\nSo we took a very large portions of these bettered areas and just put in Rose's again beautiful small short trip roses to filled and just make it look beautiful but you don't have to do anything with them their their summer and winter\nYou're done so I've started putting plants in solve the problem I'm done with those areas other than reading in fertilizing and that's something you got to keep in mind the expense of owning things never goes away there's always going to be waiting in fertilizing so\nWe get back to the pool zones where we're filling in these beds and now we're investing in something now we're buying that red house by buying these plants and putting these plants and that won't die that will stand you after year after year\nI'm investing I'm getting the return from those plants the beauty\nWithout the annual cost and maintenance management intensity to putting the new budget every single year\nI'm solving my long term problems by investing in something that will pay dividends for years that's what you need to do with a red house or apartment complex will take a short break be right back to the ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nYou're listening to the Joe ... radio show will be back with more
