the ... the state with may as well 'cause that [noise] I think you can help me understand a fan of what's happening in America project that I'm working on a\nGreat\nJob on by tied to the gym yeah essentially wanting to know what state sales but the last couple of years is a Donald Trump in office and find out what people are thinking\nOut by the judge he if he is the main issue with aids and they tend to elections and adults of what it means for the white politicians go about speaking to an electorate out to\nA camp by any twenty six thing that that changed so much about American politics and and so it was really interested to speak with you and find out to get a sense of how your audience say those things and and ah I guess ... not the case in Virginia as well\n[noise] okay well there's two issues James one is Virginia and when is national so the Trump policies the Trump America First policies and his administration\nAre not been can do serve to Republicans get elected statewide in Virginia\nAt one of the reasons for that is the number the growing number of federal employees that live in Virginia and work in Washington DC for the federal government the Trump Administration has not seen by federal workers as friendly to them as you know he's just asked for a five percent\nAcross the board reduction in all agencies which means jobs he also called for a pay freeze for federal workers because of the debt that we have\nSo Virginia is an anomaly than the tremendous numbers of people living in northern Virginia that are not Trump\nSo Porter is basically dominate the state and so that's why it has gone democratic and so the northern Virginia area it really makes it tough for\nTrump's Republican Party to win state wide now in other parts of the state of Virginia they are doing five south West Virginia southern Virginia or the shore area are they all have Republicans elected there and we expect all of them\nTo get reelected James nationally\nIt's very different nationally it is very different and what this president has done in these midterms which is very different from status quo when you know we use the great disruptor as he's barn stormed the country\nQuote when you know we use the great disruptor as he's barn stormed the country and he's made this midterm election a referendum\nOn his administration on his America First policies on the Trump autonomy on trade and on the success of these ads and basically he said if you\nWant jobs you vote for me if you want a country you vote for me if you want mobs and caravans you vote for them and so he is\nReally made this a simple choice and he's gotten in the states where many races are tied and right now twelve days out what looked like three months ago almost certain that Democrats would take control the house\nIt is now tied that's up for grabs I put it that fifty fifty three months ago it was like eighty five Fifteen everybody thought\nThe Republicans would win control and some people actually thought they had a chance to win the United States Senate that's not happening either Republicans are going to gain big there that tied with twelve days is starting to turn Trump's why James\nSo I'm really interested Johnson to understand the difference in the east side of that in the junior and what did the state than it is that because\nOne of the prices that are ... interesting in in things like what you're talking about the Donald Trump making these men tend to that himself he's in ... states represent to a\nWhen you have a good job and you feel secure in your job\nAnd you can bring money into put food on the table and support your family and by your son baseball shoes or\nYour daughter and New Jersey dress for dance or take them to a movie on a Saturday Night that's what you're for it doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or Democrat crack or\nThis or that that's driving Trump's popularity it's jobs it's economic prosperity its economic growth and it's being positive about what the future holds\nBecause many say that as many say some of the things that took care of and for example as as far\nAs what James\nWhere a lot of his opponents say like look at the ... on the caravan for example is as appealing to feel rather than positivity\nWell one ten thousand\nIllegal migrants are coming to invade your country how are you supposed to react you supposed to be excited about that\nI mean first of all we're a country of laws the laws are getting flaunted we have an open borders situation and so when ten thousand or seven thousand or a thousand\nIllegal aliens come in statistics show\nThat Ninety nine percent of them because of our stupid laws that the Democrats had been in favor of Ninety nine percent of them ended up staying in the United states now have you come in illegally and you stay in the U.S here's what happens you wind up in school\nSo you take resources that's number one the second thing that happens is\nYour a low skilled worker therefore you drive down wages\nSo you're not getting Fifteen dollars an hour like you should in the United states like companies should pay wages start dropping\nBecause you were flooded the market with access cheap labor so wages go down pay goes down\nAnd then if you've got two people competing for a job and one will take seven dollars an hour seven twenty five and the other one wants to wells who gets the job the one that was seven twenty five and that's the illegal so this is not a positive and what the president in a citizen of\nThe some of the ... and ... to ... and and something that they would cause as well you know they [noise]\nLike very ... and some of these ... was saying look we simply would not be able to operate without spending so many of them in that town initially illegally in life and I both to find a way to obtain a base at all but\n... who had come initially and they was that was certainly a strong on the standing\nOn the Republican side amongst a number of devices and and people that I spoke to the value of the ... of of having migrant workers who are paid to do jobs that they said they simply could not get Americans to do\nThen do it legally James and go through our visa application process and do it legally and then once you legal guess what you got to pay taxes you're part of the U.S jobs system\nAnd then you have to go back when your visa expires let me ask you something James if a a caravan of ...\nIs it expires ... something James if a a caravan of ships right now\nFrom Guatemala were selling into Sydney, Australia ten thousand of them and they just want jobs and\nWho knows who was in the Caribbean James some of them could be terrorists who knows rights could be human traffickers are better than there no one knows could be anybody but somebody funded them\nAnd fifty ships land in Sydney and they say look we just want asylum but Australian farmers you know they're going to be happy because they can pay us five dollars an hour and we'll\nDo while they're farming and clean their hotel rooms or whatever and so uh what was the reaction would be the Australian government would they'd be like sure come on in the world for all all for one we got plenty of money here or would they send them back James\nOr the the tower describing government would would most it and they did that to do on the\n[noise] the by the immigration in stride as saying a similarly fiercely ride gene was to for many years and a lot of it and his wife has done on very similar she ... the U.S close our\nBorders are in the woods that national anthem could buy the south a little bit more of a hurdle but certainly the issue was a ... a asylum\nSeeking loads of a papal coming on boats down from South Asia south east Asia as being a a a major [noise]\nAnd I just sticking plenty and strategy in politics as well for quite a while and I think it sort of thing and it goes in many ways to sort of what my destination what Easter people's destination is with with what happens in America because\nEvery one of the west the will of the Democratic well do the has has oh what a long look to America's at the lie on the hill and hitting a ton\nTo many of the debate which uh which is not unique to America at that which are important to buy a democracy the world either and at and and and the the interest in in what has changed in and says the influences which is shaping American politics today\nSo in Australia you've passed laws that basically except illegal immigrants on a skill and merit basis for instance if ... has a need for pipe sitters\nAnd there's a pipe fitter is in Somalia that apply to come to Australia and the Australian government knows that if they let them in and they go through the proper legal Australian paperwork that they're going to get a job as a pipe fitter and contribute to the Australian economy they let them it\nThat makes a lot of sense that's the kind of laws the U.S needs\nA merit based skill based system where if we determine economically that we have a need for a certain skill or for a certain job then regardless of where those immigrants might be from\nThey get to the top of the list because we're not saying we don't want him in Prince or we don't want migrants or we don't want people coming into the United states what President Trump is saying is we want them to come in and be able to get a job to come in legally and be able to contribute\nTo the betterment of society not come in go on welfare not have a skill get a phone get housing\nGet food get food stamps and overwhelm a local school system that doesn't make any sense right no country can ... if you do that\nYou basically don't have a country you have basically a massive land and eventually you go bankrupt the United states has a Twenty one trillion dollar debt\nThe policy of just open borders and letting anybody in because we happened to be really good people no longer makes any sense otherwise James no borders you don't have a country\nAnd I I mean I can certainly understand what the ... have that appeal to\nDevices I guess the the interesting side effect is\nTrying to understand what that means intensive like a ball that appeals to nice places what people think when they when they say does what sort of sentiments and emotion instead of I think has a [noise]\nEven listening to the Democratic politics now try to understand by the way that that got Raul waited I guess that role in twenty six saying that they were entirely blind to\nThe appeal of Donald Trump and his appeal to the working class [noise]\nIt's really interesting to try and understand Sybil which messages appeal and and I I'm\nKind of interested as well to to to ask you if you if you feel the Democratic party has learned anything from twenty six day and and what you observed by state and local races in it at a national level what are they doing differently I learned anything do you think\nNo didn't learn nothing that you just look at the policies that they've been acted if you look at the national democratic agenda right now\nDo you have any idea what they stand for or what they're attempting to do other than the hate Trump do you have any idea do they have a single policy\nNo they're going to impeach Trump and roll back the biggest tax cut in history\nAnd they're going to open up the borders and they're going to increase sanctuary cities in a whole bunch of them want to get rid of the only law enforcement organization we have cold ice that's the acronym in order to really move illegal so the Democratic policies are\nGoing to be two million dollars a year it's spent on food assistance programs like food stamps wake and free school lunches for illegal criminal aliens\nTo point five billion dollars a year instead of the Medicare for illegal criminal aliens\n... billion dollars a year it's spent on primary and secondary school education for children here illegally and they still cannot even speak English John seven million dollars a year and then for education for the American born children of illegal criminal aliens also known as anchor babies\nThree million dollars and day it's going to incarcerate illegal criminal aliens\nThirty percent of all federal prison inmates are illegal criminal aliens\nNineteen billion dollars a year and spend it on a little pleading for welfare and social services by the American taxpayers\nHundred million dollars a year and breast American wages\nAre caused by the illegal criminal aliens on housing and six illegal criminal aliens how I'm forty five million dollars and Ramadan says to their countries of origin\nWhen you add all this cost up this is a whopping three hundred and thirty eight point three million dollars a year\nOut of your pocket the my pocket our children's pocket and everyone listening to us right now\nAnd I encourage everyone listening if you want to understand more about the problem we are dealing with\nAnd go to the nearest book Barnes and noble store and buy my book rise rise in defense of Judeo Christian values and freedom because we are losing our country before our very eyes also for more information on that stuff\nPeople can go to our organization's website pack for America dot org\nBack for America dot org we named the organization act for America and I think

got twelve days in the midterms you vote Republican you're voting for jobs you\nVoting for economic prosperity you voting for a continuation of the America First policies led by Donald J Trump you vote for the Democrats are voting for mob and Taliban that's it and you want to turn the clock back on the tax cuts and everything else\nNow what you're gonna have to do or through the next twelve days\nOr say polls because now we have a new system in the United states ladies and gentlemen you know it's big news is now we have big poles we're big polls to drive fake news\nTo draw the conclusion let me say it again in the next\nTwelve days be very wary of what the legacy media is going to do here's what the legacy media is going to continue to do the New York times\nCNN\nThe fake news said polls\nDriving fake news for fake narrative for a fake inclusion it's all fake\n\nAnd you've got to get the food's right here from your ... of the truth in America and that's me once CNN puts a poll out showing\nMayor Gillum and Florida up by twelve boys override the Sanders and he's a socialist that is absurdity beyond belief that sort of real poll none of these polls are real\nNot one of them are real they did this do you do thousand sixteen and they're going to do it again\nAnd these are not polls to disseminate legitimate information these are polls to drive a result so you're going to get from the legacy media fake news with fake polls\nTo drive the fake narrative to get a fake inclusion and here's what they want you to do they're going to continue to tell you and lie to you with these polls are they take with fake metrics than false information these are pushed falls\nTo trying to get a result and here's what you're going to get\nYou going to get a constant drumbeat for the next world they just like they did in November two thousand sixteen saying there's a blue wave coming in the Democrats are going to win a hundred seats the generic numbers of widened to Fifteen all the Republicans are the press don't bother to work\nDon't hear that a flyer don't knock on doors don't make phone calls don't do anything because look the polling numbers show the Republicans are cook\nAnd so why waste your time go enjoy the weekend the a football game and have a beer that's what they want you to do they don't want you to work they don't want you to get involved they don't want you to be enthusiastic so they're going to lie to you with fake polls driving fake news to get a fake narrative\nAnd at the end of the day they want to fake inclusion drawn\nSo they can get their own sake result polls by these legacy fake news yours\nNo longer to disseminate legitimate information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative\nGentlemen information and inform the public they are done to drive a narrative to buttress whatever result they want\nAnd so that's why I've been telling you for weeks you just take one district and that's the tempted Virginia just one and I've been telling you for weeks Barbara Comstock is either tighter ahead and she's going to win that race out finally a poll comes out showing a tide finally some legit poll somewhere\nAll the other fake news polls\nShowed her down by Fifteen\nAnd I knew for a fact that was not true same thing now they're showing spanberger ahead in the seventh fake they're showing coal burning ahead a recommended a fifth regiment is going to win that race by double digits\nThey wanted the press Republican turnout and depressed or volunteers and they do this by lying to you\nOr we're beyond fake news now\nNow we have networks of the legacy media that won't even report certain news items if they think it's going to interfere with their narrative talking points of the day which is to defeat trumpet the Republicans\nAnd look I Know there's a lot of Republicans out there that drive you nuts and you don't want to vote for them and they voted this way or they voted that way they didn't do this or they didn't do that or there was some in fight or a primary fight or a few going on\nYou got twelve days\nHere's my thing let's unite now let's keep the house Republican\nLet's build the Republican majority in the U.S Senate so President Trump then continue his phenomenal America First policies and keep this country moving ahead what we do that on November seventh then we can fight again let's wait now fight later\nOh I don't like this one because he didn't he beat cancer okay whatever go fight with Dave later oh I don't like Scott Taylor cause he beat Randy Forbes I fight with him later oh I don't like Barbara cushy voted this way or that way\nSo I'm going to vote no I'm going to vote for nobody or I'm going to vote libertarian or I'm going to stay home it's ridiculous\nRight now what Trump if you're a Trump supporter Trump needs a Republican majority period doesn't matter who it is and he's a Republican majority\nYou want to pick your petty fights and we all have them I get it do it later\nThere's a lot of people not getting on my show that I have few did with and you know who they are not going to mention their names and they come on now every single week why because we've got to bring everybody together get everybody on the same page for twelve days and when this election\nBecause we are we are we're working against\nHundreds of million dollars in swat money hundreds of millions of dollars from the Hollywood crazy left wing hers and the entire fake news legacy media network which has aligned now behind the Democrats\nAnd so that's what you're finding so fake news is out there and I'm\nGoing to say it again you're going to get fake polls which is fake news to drive the fake narrative to get a fake inclusion and the end game is to get the result they want which is Democrats to take power so they can do what roll back the tax cuts impeached Trump\nYou ... you were two thousand Eighteen ...
