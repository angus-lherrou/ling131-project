Michael Moore\nDuring his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's a square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope as if he was having a meeting with him Michael Moore is left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood\nKills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country\nSo if the pope knowingly and wittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly\nBig fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over but I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor yet repairing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits out as if the second circuit as a conflict with the sex or the ninth throughout the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases a year\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts you're talking about maybe a million cases below the U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases\nSo whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals\nOf the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges only four by Republican in one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which was the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're seven at three majority seven three one vacancies now available but that's going to be one of the three so it was gonna say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level and all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges\nSo before you get to fired up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to all those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict courts about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be an office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it will take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent in the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and only about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday the\nDemocrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen there's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term continuous more fun becomes available away a few lines open to be calling out seven seven three one two three one one eighty seven seven three one three eight one\nOne bill Cunningham the great American in for the gray one for a living and\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done David ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the ex chair provides\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ... chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ... chairs on sale now for a one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L.

Carter Page and a quarter page of the central figure\nOf the a spy gates scandal right ah and and he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the Democratic National Committee and against a Perkins ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party ... and especially I\nImplore you read Donald Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happens\nHer experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess it was completely mess and she she tells a lot of troops in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC how the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in\nAnd they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know sly and Carter Page uh that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week fired adept filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... not well why do they go after those people will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly [laughter] that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities that wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a a five to warrant\nA petition for and approved or to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through Pfizer chords for them to survey on him\nTo look into every little or if his of his electronic footprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency\nTo spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it is real fights are born and they're supposed to be a very high bar to get a five to warrant\nAnd to get this fight so weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the price of weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there and black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty six stayed on\nBehalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\nSo Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week suing the DNC and ... with this law firm for defamation and I think about this from it\nCarter Page is either an agent of the Russian government and basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been signed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other right\nThere's no in between here there's no if and or certainly no but I mean if there was a button here would be a car Daschle and proportions\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a studio ... of the prudent Kremlin\nOr he is completely innocent\nAnd and you know I don't know if you know a lot about Carter pays like I said isn't that a lot of a media [noise] he's a Naval Academy graduate\nHe was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise] he was in intelligence\nIn the navy and an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get him to military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise]\nUm and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his initial academy education\nHe then went into private business and did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is it that they haven't noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia and you can argue with that if you wanted to understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had to reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a rock Obama was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy in won re election\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the ... government is as bad as everyone says that's what that's not a legal\nHe he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nNo sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make him a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here\nCarter Page could very well be\nAn agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that has presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and let him are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that per minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin ... Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that were true\nWhy would you file a lawsuit why\nWould you file a defamation lawsuit against the dmc because you see the perfect the fact that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense a well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are an agent of the Russian government\nWhy would you do that would you do that\nAnd I again I I he could be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck in Andrew McCabe Loretta Lynch and and the whole team over there during the Obama administration\nWho ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then oh so much of the leak to the press shocking how much of it got leaked to the press they could all be true in there with the angels", "show_name": "Dr. Asa On Call", "month": "10", "state": "FL", "day": "21", "station": "WBOB", "city": "Jacksonville"}
