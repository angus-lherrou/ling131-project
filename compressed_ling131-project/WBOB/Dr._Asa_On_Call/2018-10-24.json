I I've been involved in other groups and and my own business and you're a rerun a a small appliance ... or ... and you just don't share\nAnd so it was it with I was sort of taken aback but I I left them can't life for over a year every day to get ... get some positive attitude in my life but it yeah yeah it was not too many places that people will share their their numbers like yeah\nYeah I could see the guy opening up a store right next to Paul Paul could you help me I'll tell me how you do this stuff [laughter]\n[laughter] right\nYeah but that's what we do that's what's crazy about as we help people and share it with them and like I'm buying the apartment complex right now there's just two doors down from one Kurdish zone so I mean you say well we're going to be in competition no we're going to raise the value of the market we're going to lose synergistic we\nYou know make the pie bigger for everybody so it really is possible to have the abundance mentality in life\nAnd work through it let's talk about you coming on board here I Know that you said uh uh you would listen to us for a long time\nBut before he even that let's talk about where you started your entrepreneurial experience obviously you own your own business so you're an entrepreneur from the very beginning but what point in that ... experience will decide you're going to start buying\nRental properties real estate\n[noise] [noise] well I've thought about if down and and I mean you say but yeah I I really don't think either ... or I just know that I'm stubborn\nAnd got like ... or just just asked why why [noise] and I didn't want to end up you know an old guy and all man bitter guy at the end of my life\nGoing I I could have done this or it\nI didn't get that rave each has the off and son didn't like it so\nI had to be self employed so that got me started\nAnd I just you know somehow South Bend over there there's a civil appliance repair but it wasn't until\nYou know six years ago I I understood passive income like buying real estate but not with a game plan and show the path of income just gives you that uh\nYou know I met him five thousand bucks a month whether right you know turn a screwdriver and not and that just totally change my whole perspective a retirement so now I'm looking forward to retirement\nWell you know it's it's interesting and the limits of people that are people who wants to call and it's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven phone lines are open but Paul you um\nYou know your own your own business and you started buying a single families but she told me that your model\nWhen you started was different than the lifestyles model and that it had a different goal in mind why don't you share with everybody what that was and how you feel about that goal compared to your new perspective a investing\nShare what it back in the nineties um ... they can get a syllable loans and Arizona so I was I already knew how to buy out of state so I I was okay with that tell you you were to sit on the phone to take over and then you\nPut the gold and wants to break either so\nBut the thing that we had at the time I didn't know any better and then at the end of Thirty years he had a small house pay for and you get you know send your kid off to college the reality it was sort of still the pile of money theory\nOr it wasn't until later that the path of income coming in and whether he you know do anything or not so that that's the biggest difference I found was lifestyles and you're you're getting income every month and you're not you're doing that like this thing\nAnd carriage so I'm looks like we have someone on hold I don't know is is there a name you want to give me as to who's on hold or not are they not their mother just imagine in that\n[laughter] All right [noise] so um you you bought these houses and you know there was no casual what did you end up doing with those did they ever turned ... period of time or not\n[noise] well

like branch off boats\nUh and the other thing is I Am in phenomenally good health right now I mean is the greatest thing of cognitive dissonance you will ever see is the fact that I Am in really good shape in fact I'm In better shape than most of you All right so what we're not talking about today we're not talking about cancer\nBecause I spent a lot of time talking about that I'm really not interested if you have any herbal supplements remedies please stay away from me\nThat we're not going to talk about things that are even more important than that cheating a childhood dreams were not going to talk about my wife and I told my kids because I'm good but I'm not good enough to talk about that without tearing up so we're just going to take that off the table that's much more important\nAnd we're not going to talk about spirituality and religion [laughter] um so what is it is talk about that it's about my childhood dreams and have achieved them I've been very fortunate that way how\nI Believe I've been able to enable the dreams I've been able to enable the dreams of others and to some degree lessons learned I'm a professor there should be some lessons learned and how you can use the stuff you here today to achieve your dreams or unable to dreams of others and as you get older you may find that enabling the dreams of others thing is even more fun\nAnd that's something we should not lose sight of is that the inspiration and the permission to dream is huge [noise] so what were my childhood dreams you may not agree\nWith this list that I was there a\nZero gravity playing in the national football league ... author in our world book encyclopedia I guess you can tell the nerds early and I wanted to be an imagine here with us and uh it turns out that NASA\nSomething called the vomit comet so they used to train the astronauts on this thing does parabolic Arkes at the top of each argued about twenty five seconds\nWhere you ballistic and you get about ... equivalent of weightlessness for about twenty five seconds and there is a program where college students can submitted proposals and if they win the competition they get to fly\nAnd I thought that was really cool and we had a team of putting together and they want and they got to fly and I was all excited 'cause I was going to go with them\nAnd then I first brick wall because they made very clear that under no circumstances were faculty members allowed to fly with the teams\nI Know I was heartbroken right by work so hard [laughter]\n\nAnd so I read the literature very carefully and turns out that NASA it's part of the outrage in publicity program and it turns out that the students were allowed to bring the local media journalists from their home town [noise]\nAnd uh [noise]\nRented out wherever journalist is really easy to get a press pass so I don't think I saw and I said I Need to know where to fact some documents and they said what documents are you gonna facts as I said my resignation as the faculty adviser and my application as the journalist [noise]\nAnd he said that's a little transparent don't you think [noise]\nAnd I said yeah but our project as virtual reality and we're going to bring down a whole bunch of VR headsets and all the students from all the teams are going to experience at an all those other real journalists are going to get to film it showed that dream number one check [laughter]\nSorry let's talk about football my dream was to play in the national football league and what do we do know that I actually put no [noise]\nNo I did not make it to the national football league but I've probably gotten more from bats dream and not accomplishing\nIt then I got from any of the ones that I did accomplish [noise] um\nI I had a coach and I signed up when I was nine years old I was the the smallest kid in the league by far and I had a coach Jim Graham who was six foot four he played linebacker at Penn State he was justice hope of a guy and he was old school okay I mean really old school like he thought the forward pass was a trick play\n[laughter] any sort of a practice the first day and you know you just dig hulking I we were all scared to death of him\nAnd he hadn't really football's how how are we going to have\nWithout any football and one of the other kids and she has me coach but there's no football and coach Graham said right how many men are on the football field a time where it's at eleven on a team twenty two\nAnd coach Graham said right how many men are on a football field a time where it's at eleven on the team twenty two and ... said All right and how many people are touching the football at any given time or one of them and he said right so we're going to work all of those other Twenty one guys are doing\n[noise] and\nThat's a really good story because it's all about fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals fundamental you've got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn't going to work\nAnd the other Jim Graham story I have is there was one practice where he just wrote me all practice just you're doing this wrong or doing the stronger back into it again you owe me you're doing pushups after practice and when it was all over one of the other assistant coaches came over and said yeah coach reemerge a pretty hard and he said\nYeah he said that's a good thing you said when\nYou're screwing up and nobody's saying anything to you anymore that means they gave up\nAnd that's a lesson that stuck with me my whole life is that when\nYou see when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody's bother to tell you any more that's a very bad place to be your critics are your lungs telling you they still love you and care\nAnd the other thing about football says we send our kids to play football or soccer or swimming or whatever it is\nAnd it's the first example of what I'm going to call a headache or indirect learning we actually don't want our kids to learn the football I mean yeah it's really nice to have a wonderful three points dance and that I Know how to do at chop block and I was kind of stuff but we send our kids to learn much more important
