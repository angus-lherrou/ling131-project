high school up until the time that I was in college and then I worked for for about four years after college\nUp until the time that I was in college and then I worked for him for about four years

about their family history and in childhood and it's really interesting because you guys came from really entrepreneurial backgrounds and\nLeo you had you know commercial real estate background and then you began to Journey Out and do all sorts of different things from there\nAnd ... you know we really look at some of the things that we we learned in childhood and and how it directs our lives how it it\nForms are thinking about things and Peggy you talked about um you know your family and just that strong entrepreneurial spirit and how you were heartbroken when they sold the business and you moved into corporate America which must have been an incredible shock\nAnd awe your ... you know working and and dealing with the corporate structure that you never dealt with before\nAnd can you talk a little bit about about that you know you you touched on the pressure you touched on I'm having a ... you know to find that that next deal when you were in sales and then what what happened as you moved out of sales\nWell what I did I I was really in a quandary trying to figure out what I wanted to do I just wasn't sure you know where I fit in with my my God given gift and so what\nI did I I did several jobs on contract where I was able to go out to get for corporations\nAnd I'm In one day I just thought she now on doing this I'm not getting any benefit on working\nWell in those days I was just working forty hours but it was more as time went on but I thought you know if I'm going to be putting in forty hours a week then I probably need to to land something and so I was at a bank and they offered me a job and I ended up staying there for Seventeen years\nAnd what was happening to me like I Would maybe go in at eight o'clock in the morning and\nUm I Would leave for about nine o'clock at night you know banks were really doing a lot of lay offs and you know if the other people's jobs Scott cat then you know\nOf layoffs and you know if that other people's Josh Scott cat then you know they needed the people that were still there to handle the workload\nAnd I was fortunate to live at the ladder because if a person that I was reporting too and um and so I ended up I was like working for a bank president and so we had our regular line of business you know the\nBusiness that we were in we were in corporate banking that paid our salaries and then we had\nThe presidential duties and that was fine but it was a lot of our ... my boss laughter bank which was stressful and I wanted to hang on because I wanted to stay there long enough to have health insurance right so I scramble called all these departments around the bank that people that I've known\nThat I got you know from being there for so long\nAnd then I landed a job and treasury where corporations would call in with issues and I was in\nCorporate customer service than we would help and you know solve their their issues in their problems and actually when I got there and they told me that my salary was going to be kept because I made more my prior job\nAnd and again that was long hours I was staying after to keep that and um you know I liked it I Love the clients that on one state passed a like rule of sixty age plus number of years of being there you could early retire and so I asked to do that at that point\nNow yeah and that's you you get to that point where it's OK here I Am I I've worked all my life for this and now I'm they're telling me that's it I can make any more money and um and no no way really within their structure to earn it\nAnd Leo ... you and in sales and you've got a variety of different things that you were doing and how did how did you experience that with your career\nAnd [noise] well I tell you all and I'm\nStarting out of the commercial real estate brokers ... my ... our our ... or a tech and show about the YMCA that I ended up you know I just got for us better at all like I've been on a date and all like three years and that's how I got to order the\nTo the wine industry and doing that I Would always do it all happened as you'd end up they give you a territory and you build up your wine cells um and and and\nAs time went on you would end up getting it tore you'd be lacking pretty good money and then I cut your territory but you just go and they call you and and that's the you know instead of getting two and three quarters\nOr satellite yourself you're going to end up getting you know we're going to give you tune in at a quarter and it's just you couldn't say I'd say you know like that wants to marry and built this up I've met all my all this and you're going to do this to me and I just say that's the way it's going to be in because\nThat's the word came down from ... headquarters and I'll just I'll tell you what my blood pressure or just go right through the roof\nUm and it was time run on the other part of it we got older older a lot of times you have going on at two o'clock in the morning go do grocery store reset um on wines and um you're doing it for a lot of other people in the next thing you know that is doing a mentor is on once a month and the warehouse and\nThey just kept that and the net and things to it and I'm Sorry I just ... when\nThe uh add printing business and picked up and I found some pretty lucrative jobs I did that for a long time and that was that was good odds and when I got out I like I had mentioned in the past I never really enjoyed\nManaging people can sometimes you know it was just a manual job on the other end of the ads running machine but it was just also door that maybe they wouldn't show up or they wouldn't and they'd be compliant and or they want more money while you're in and it's just\nThat was a first right in and of of that business along with going on and um I had a tour\nThere's many in by members of my family die of cancer\nAs time went on I kept coming back home or tell patients that you know what my ears are ringing well and the pad printing business using as a um oil based inks were pickup damaging to drop it off on the on the item that you're praying\nAnd Peggy said you know what there's there's it's kind of a family business and um\nMaybe this isn't a wise thing to do\nAnd so I'm with my family being and having some cancer\nAnd everything I thought you know what I've run across inscribed charge that wanted to end up he kept bothering me you're going to bomb a business and I kept telling them you know or he wanted me to teach them how to pay for ... I had to learn on my own and it was really it is it's caught it from technicalities to it\nAnd so um I thought you know one of the fellas go after this God or get out of this thing and um you know just met mom on top of the world right now I'm off work it out at the top and so that's\nWhat I ended up doing and I'm and I'm Glad I did it because I'm Still alive today and Myers aren't rain and I'm saying was I Know that that was a a by didn't have problems that's one thing about being a ... but it was such a a neat and business and there were so much in demand for it\nAnd I'm a because a lot of people never heard of it and um I mean I could pick up customers and it just got better and better but you know if you aren't going to be alive what the heck\nYeah what what does it really adamant in those those right instead of you and ... you know this trans transformational story of you know working through the traditional model coming from entrepreneurial homes than getting thrown into more of the traditional model that most of us experience with work\nAnd then realizing the need for change and this is Len Morrow with Peggy and Leo on the Dell wants the radio show in in a moment we'll be back with more of this story as we talk about change and discovering where we really fit in life if you have a question for Peggy or Leo age\nSeven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven we'll be right back\nUm because what\nHappened is that all came back to me with the knowledge from the family from law from um\nUh just you know going to school and learning about real estate but I had you know uh but there are certain things about the oil they all family you know with ... and all and cousins\nAll this kind of disenchanted because of after the past you know my parents and the market at all you know people there wasn't there needed to be a plan and great to be control on things and\nTo all kinds of disenchanted with that it ended with a real estate um aspect and so until I came across lifestyles and they saw road solve those problems one other thing that kind of got my attention is\nI just remember my father and uncle born under a deal down in Houston and it was a deal worth it was an apartment complex and I just got out of college and\nUh I like I said you know what why don't you go to the closing down in Houston and so that gave me the closing statement unless they want you to when you get this call the account and and I want you want you to tell them the numbers and everything it's like any of this closing statement ... she was\nI said I didn't tell me about this deal and stuff and I said how long have you on this and I said five years and I said I got through it analyze it and I thought I saw an ally of the hundred and twenty five percent for five years in less than that I said forget that they are such a\nA male is is this is unbelievable and there were just limit the partners in that situation it was last are gone and they'd gotten on a\nLimited partnership and I'm I'm Down in ...\nAnd that always stuck with me and I thought man this is all of a ...\nAnd so on that kind of let me go to the point where you know real estate was still on mom on and I'm Glad I had done what I'd done in the past and um it was painful going through the argument for family members after our aunts or uncles and parents and a passing cars or you know the ...\nThere needed to be a plan and that there was one and so that was a shame\nBut um I've seen everything from trade and ... and um you know just all the benefits that go with real estate so that that kind of bought me up to that point\nSee we're ready to jump in you know you you'd you'd seen that real estate work and it's really interesting I'm I'm a second generation real estate investor too and and it's really interesting how our parents don't actually teaches the nitty gritty of the business right into somehow it's something you do homicide while you pursue that\nTraditional route but Peggy I think you are a lot more skeptical about this weren't you\n\nOh I definitely was Lynn I you know I thought about the money that we spent to be trained on a stock options and we actually did tax Wayne investing for a while and that was quite an education I don't feel like that was a waste of time um\nBut you know after paying those space I thought oh no here we go again 'cause those didn't exactly work out long term for us\nAnd so ... was just hot he was ready to sign up and it was around the holidays the Christmas holidays in like every night we have our own office in our homes because we work out of our home and he just kept coming and going you're going to sign now we got to sign up business the real deal and I still I just\nI don't know so what I did I thought I Need to put a stop to the U.S either right or proven wrong because it was getting stressful around the house so I remember David Fisher who does that um two day training he had mentioned some\nYou know members that were national award winners and these are people competing nation wide as operators of apartment and lifestyles hit one has one I think over the last eleven years than I thought oh whatever you know so I went on lifestyles website to see if I could see their names but I did\nThat wasn't really a nice so what I did I went on to um national apartment association website and I saw their names is actually wanting needs towards and I thought wow I'm right around ... right and some company that could train you to do that\nThat was the turning point for me so I decided I was ready to join and layovers like hallelujah [laughter]\nShowing you know that that's it you know and\nShe would come around you know yeah it yeah I didn't know it was she was a member

him as a wonder kind here's Chuck on this early time\nMy early years because of some of my family to go to college\nEarly years because of her first of all my family or to go to college I thought if I could get to college and I won a scholarship at Brown university\nAnd when I got through there it was time for me to go into the military because the Korean War was raging and so I became a lieutenant in the Marines and roses very rapidly one honors in school\nLike everything I didn't realize what I was successful I went to law school nights while I was working as an assistant to non state senator at one point Newsweek wrote about me is the youngest you're not you're not gonna\nYoungest administrative assistant to United States Senate I think I was twenty eight\nAnd ran campaigns loved it started a war for great success got to know Richard Nixon and Nineteen sixty eight when he was elected president you asked me to come I was at that point\n\nAs I found out because he never done this with anyone before\nI thought about that for the next three months\nI couldn't get a lot of my mind and so I went back to when he was in August of Nineteen Seventy three and I was a time you got to explain this to me and he said before I Do I Want to rejoice chapter from a book chapter I'd recommend for all of you particularly because you're Taipei high achievers you wouldn't be a Columbia rather was and I am\nHe read to me the chapter from cs Lewis says Mira Christianity\nEntitled the great\nVice the great Sam\nProbably not as always looking through life looking down on other people and things and therefore can't sing something above themselves have measurably suburbia God [noise]\nI listen to this chapter and single so so if you know I'm the Oxford dean who was a great Christian Apollo just as well as a great professor of medieval literature\nI listen to that and I realized he was running around me\nI thought I'd done all these good things because I wanted to\nServe my country and I wanted to be a success at my profession and\nIt was really all about me\nAnd I sat there that night in pain and listening to that chapter\nAnd I'm Tom told me how we'd gone forward and said here in New York with Billy Graham preaching given his life to Christ and I was really moved he wanted to pray with me and I said no I'd I'd never parade except on the church so the price but that might eat\nHe told me of his own experience when he did was like to Christ and here I was a tough guy and\nI don't think I'd ever cried or I'd love to know if I did I left his home that night\nI look back and I got into the automobile and I tried to drive away though I could not\nThe tough guy was crying too hard I couldn't see the road and the front of me and I pulled over and sat there I have no idea for how long\nWe so now maybe longer\nThinking about my life thinking about could there be a God that is if the work that I Know him\nAnd I just called out to them I didn't know any of the words I'd never seen any brochures about average all close them I never knew that was such a thing about organized Christianity except at once in a while the drug to church as a kid but that night for the first time in my life I was sure that was a kind of\nAnd I was sure he was hearing me\nI woke up the next morning figured I was going to be embarrassed and still they couldn't wait to get my hands on her Christianity and read it from cover to cover it\nAnd I can only tell you that book did it for me to forty two years without God and same chapter and that's where I almost wasn't going to be able to speak after that I've not heard that clip of for\nI mean if you are struggling with pride pick up near Christianity middle wacky over the side of the\nSo you're taking that first step and is Christian walk but if it was a lonely first up is author Erik ma taxes who wrote the great book bone offer tells us\nHe became a Christian depressed couldn't believe that this heart knows you know um they called them the White House shit man do anything to get the president elected sort of dirty politics that this guy became a Christian nobody would believe it she became a Christian and because I knew him personally I can tell you this man was the real deal\nWell a lot of people wondering whether this was just a fake conversion and people were doubting Carlson story former attorney general

that he was humble and without that conviction who knows what happened in the truck wholesome and look at all the things that would not have happened\n\nIt was just something for all of us to remember and our own trying time to remember that there's a purpose in them\nIt's happening for a reason hard to understand when it's happening it's happening all of us ... humidity right now you're wondering

have to go to jail I'll go to jail\nHis his lawyer and I I tell this in in the book\nWent crazy and he said you don't understand no one does this you take the plea shut up and take the plea bargain Chuck refuses\nChuck refused again the new man has to do things differently and not with the lawyers say\nNot what the lawyers say Carlson knew he didn't have any code ability with the Watergate scandal but he also knew in his soul he wasn't guilt free and its face wouldn't let him walk away from the fact\nThey go back to Washington and I was I was guilty as all of these sort of being all the prosecutors and I just it was forty four times on the roof\nAnd one day I realized I got to put an end to this and so I took the one thing that actually do something I hadn't been charged with or
