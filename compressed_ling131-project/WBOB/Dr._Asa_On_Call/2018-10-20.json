and your life waiting to hear the truth the lifestyle you really want to our world changed\nKnow you were going to be a national award winning and the video and founder of lifestyles that was\nWhat was going to do once a radio show where the hype is in the health begins ... always we're working on your financial freedom with me here today is the developer of lifestyles discovery dot com which is a appraisal software that we had developed for us a welcome to show David\nBaker do\nSo well let's go back many years ago when I first started this stuff but if there was almost no way to know if you're buying a deal that was profitable deal because you were crossing the real estate agents to give your data and if you go way way back their data wasn't even computerized she it was simply listings that we're in\nWhat they looked like magazines at that time and that was all the the listings they're each month to get a new set of listings type of deal later they started having you know software type ... and at that time\nI had to buy real estate company to be able to get access to the data there was no way you could get data unless you owned a real estate company\nAnd so I did and I started having the opportunity to manipulate this data and to be able to come up with the ideas that way you actually can not decide whether or not you should buy a piece of real estate didn't let you have accurate comparable sale\nThe reason the value of the house is based on it's comparable market sale in other words that which is in the neighborhood that is directly related to it that has sold within the last three six and if you have to go that far back twelve months\nAnd that's how appraisers come up with the appraisals\nThe problem is you have to have access it\nAppraisers come up with the appraisals the problem is you have to have access to data and real estate brokerage firms I have a giant giant lobby\nThat kept us from four years from being able to get that data because if they had that day to day control everything they can tell you something that's a good deal or not a good deal a bad deal or they can talk to you into lifting your property 'cause only they knew what your property is really worth\nAnd they also control what you would buy because they're telling you what stuff is worth now I'm not saying the real ... agents were scrupulous or that they misrepresented\nAre not making that statement although I'm sure there were some of them to do that but I'm not making an overall judgment student I'm just saying you we were in adequate as a real estate investors into you came along I don't remember what year was it was ten years ago were Fifteen Years ago whatever ah ten years we'll get\nTen years and you came to me a sit down [noise]\nI Want you to look at what I developed\nAnd when you came to me and you showed me that software program\nInstantly I knew that the world had just change for real estate developing a real estate purchase and sales and rental um the first program David started was program called quest\nAnd what we did was we bought data stores from the real estate companies and he put this program together that you could read but we only had it available to our members and only in the Texas market so\nTwo for one by one more age you have large X. dot com\nLeaves the summertime [noise] go to the original to this

am\nSix hundred one on one point one of them talk radio W. B. O. B.\nWelcome back you know here's some more traditional wisdom to set you free the man on a mission to retire American one person at a drawing\nLooked back to do on the radio show with me here today is Damon Janice who's the developer of the lifestyles discovery appraisal software and a damning as I said well we went to break it like you just walk through it and tell people the multitude of things that the software does for you\nI think another over to our you'll be really after him and if I wanted to share that I went back and I did occur in the database start a couple of months ago and over the last ten years that we've had the uh appraisals ... there have been two million valuations\nOh wow why a lot and and then I when I started in that and you're talking about twenty minutes before we had to stop doing it I Wish him now take like and then I hear so much out there so I calculated it saved about fifty nine years of productivity with all of the people have been doing\nA pretty cool [laughter] uh um so so what the system\nDoes it actually really some years which made the program even harder to make it simpler but it makes them more powerful so what you did she go and you enter an address the subject property address that you want to evaluate\nAnd it takes crunches numbers for a couple of seconds and that brings up a screen that shows you what the value of the property\nAnd a confidence level associated with a and then it shows you the rent value is what you can rent or and the confidence about the first to go to the commission house in most cases\nYou can just go with those numbers now there's also a teacher or you can look at detailed comparable you want to see what all the property are similar to the subject carpeted how much they sold or in the last century or so long and it shows you all that information\nUm and and occasionally you want to go and the confidence is low on sale or where do they want to go into but most of the time you don't even\nNeed to do that with data are good um and then what will happen is pre sold out the cash for calculator and\nUh and all you need to do it because they are like why rent and you want to but again based on that valued at what price you want to\nBut again based on that valued at what price you want to\nDo you plan on purchasing the property for that you put those two pieces of information and this calculator conscious all the numbers\nAnd ended up at like instantaneously very very uh so what it tells you how much cash out of pocket it will require to purchase property\nAnd that depends on your financing whether the conventional loan or hard money laundering private financing whatever it handles all those scenarios they'll tell you how much money is going to take to purchase property\nAnd then it gives you a court cases in the nation that telling you if it's a great deal or not and that is that it shows you the unreliable ...\nYou'll have your annual cash flow and then it'll tell you you're percent return on the capital gain and percent return on the cash flow\nAnd so once you have that information\nOr which again it just takes just a few seconds there are a very very fast\nUm then you you can say okay that was like a really good deal I Want him to Florida or\nIt's not and I'm just going to go check and that property so you know you can you can run through the they say you can you tell in the morning when your breakfast and there's a term really quick and just stay on top of it and they get a feel\nSo once you have the evaluation of course it's been keeps track fall out of all that and\nUh and you can um you can go back to the previous evaluation in bed and took the numbers from 'em and you can make copies of evaluations can export them into a Pdf file them into your real estate agent uh can\nUm do all those kind of I mean you can add in the evaluation that you can remember he a functioning we're making\nYou know it's a really come a long way this the the problem that we had in the past\nWas that we couldn't get the correct information now we're not only getting the information you're giving us a percentage of accuracy or how did they act as a software program come up with it they suspected percentage of accuracy\nYeah it's really interesting because the ... the news comes from multitude of sort of like a piano or\nYou know if some of the day that is available there's public information there's private information that companies have the data providers that we're using are collecting all of the nation and depending on the horse it's more reliable or less reliable\nAnd so they have a an evaluation model that it kind of an algorithm that goes that based on all of this\nInformation put this particular property law signed the confidence to\nThat reminds me of something I Want to mention are quite a lot of people got to do in order to do their evaluation because they'll have like a sail value on around you have to be very careful with that because their data is is very problematic I had a subscriber emailed me about a month ago\nAnd he said you're you know I spoke discoveries showing you the property or a hundred and twenty thousand dollars and I was telling the four hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nAnd I went and I looked at the comparable than there is no way to property worth a hundred thousand 'cause all the comparable or like a hundred and Fifteen hundred and thirty thousand dollars and so you know the softer states from making a huge mistake and going and pay too much\nFor a property but I dated at his own party and then the confident you know that's a fine value and the red value is so helpful because you know you get like a Ninety five percent confident on the wrist by all of your diet you don't have to worry about a very powerful\nYou know I remember reading an article once and it was a long time ago so don't remember the exact percentages are so I welcome you to look it up on the Internet to verify what I'm saying a for everybody who's listening but I had read this article ... had gotten the sued\nBecause people were making decisions on on data that was not accurate in ... had to come back and part of their restitution was to admit\nThat they were like only Ninety ... they're like Ninety five percent inaccurate in other words if they said it's worth a hundred and ten thousand dollars\nThere is a Ninety five percent chance the wrong not right but raw some nominal about no I don't know if that meant they were wrong by one dollar or one hundred and five dollars evolve what I'm saying like Ninety five percent of the data was wrong that was just blew my mind\nThat I probably should look at a price state that but I'm I'm well become you to look it up and see how closely came to that are ...\nBut I think I heard about that and it's a it's been a problem and and and then my you know when we were evaluating a\nA year ago and I started to get data from different providers and I was working at the landscape I Would compare it to him about what we can occur to you know all these different parts of it\nAnd and bill was consistently and you know off of what of what the numbers but I Would think it'd be really careful I met\nA professional investor should not be used in free data to to be their evaluation\nA village really get you know they get paid for referrals out to each other but not that's a great business model the company that we're getting data from they get paid because of the accuracy of data provided and so\nYou know institutional investors and private investors and paying for cetera argues the data that we have available and much of a very\nVery well I Want to thank you for coming up we're coming up to a break here uh lifestyles discovery dot com take your free seven day trial offer and go see what ... damage and this is talk about two wonderful software Dimon thanks for being on for everybody else will be back with another segment and just a few moments\n\nTheir average or they're mean as a hundred and twenty four thousand dollars\nI'm Sorry a hundred and sixty three thousand dollars my bad or if you go from fifty to fifty five it's a hundred and twenty four thousand um and it goes down precipitously from that point on as you get younger and younger and younger [noise] um but these are people\nThat are saving these are not everybody these are just people that are saving so even\nThe wealthiest right the wealthiest age group which is the senior citizens about ready to retire\nTheir\nAverage is only a hundred and sixty three thousand bucks folks I don't know how you retire at sixty three thousand dollars you're going to take the money out of your four one K. and Iran are you gonna have to pay taxes on it\nRight you're going to have to pay taxes on that money it's still in your four one K. instill in your eye ray you're getting paid thirty percent taxes maybe you could get down to Fifteen if you don't ... much out each year but that means you're living on almost nothing\nYou know to have that much saved up you've probably used earning over a hundred thousand dollars a year\nAnd now you're gonna have to learn to live on nothing\nIt just doesn't make any sense to me how can people live on that much income or lack there would be a better way of stating that you need right now to think about starting producing passive income streams yesterday I spoke to a lady\nThree years into the program her and her husband are producing Seventy two hundred dollars a month in passive income tax free which would relate to making ten thousand dollars a month in earned income after you pay taxes\nThat or the income you'd had around the Seventy two hundred dollars this is just one example of thousands of them that we're brought on the radio and war demonstrated at one of our case studies or at one of our expos of people that have had massive changes in the future because they took action\nBut this this number this set of numbers this data uh is very frightening so let me find out who's giving you this data so that you can look it up if you want to look it up this is um money\nThe websites called money visited CNBC dot com money Kathy opens\nThe data's coming from a pie I which is the economic policy Institute report economic policies Institute report\nSo are there you go five thousand\nThe median savings or does in the fifth percentile maybe better gauge the medium for all families in ... five thousand dollars and the medium for families with some savings\nIs sixty thousand dollars there it is my friend's half of all Americans have almost no money to live on when they retire [noise]\nHalf of all folks and if you take the people that aren't even tried to save its way more than half its way more than half don't have any money to retire so it's amazing to me\nThat people allowed themselves to get into the situation without at least trying to do something to change it think about it this way even if you had the highest amount\nWhich was the seniors about ready to retire which average a hundred and sixty three thousand and you take that in your four percent a year that would be three thousand two hundred\nDollars a year I make them up one percent be a hundred and sixty dollars four percent will be four times that right hundred and sixty\nNot to be more to be three thousand I think\nYou're a hundred and sixty two little on air math which nobody loves nobody loves to share a radio announcer broke for the girl for the calculator just doesn't make sense she if I can find it could only be accurate mistaken are making to take a hundred and sixty three thousand dollars\nTimes zero four percent what'd you put your financial planner so George or sixty five hundred dollars a year a year\nSixty five hundred a year not a month a year and I just don't like that then that's the best guys that's the best average and that's people about ready to retire\nThe ... group everybody else is precipitously blowback in fact the meeting on all these people\nAre the median on all these people sixty thousand dollars with savers and only five thousand dollars would not say per se so if a non saver I'm Sorry ... savor ended up with only sixty thousand bucks and he took four percent drawn that\nHe'd have what one percent of sixty thousand six hundred or six thousand six hundred right there we go with that math again it's just crazy stuff\nSixty thousand times point zero four percent twenty four hundred dollars a year you'd have to live on twenty four hundred dollars a year plus Social
