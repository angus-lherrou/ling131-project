probably gonna have some friends over probably have some kids play with it um maybe we'll use it for charity purposes\nAnd so we need to go go and think about all this and you get these answers before I can start you know getting out my cat camp software in designing the program designers laid out for you and you don't want to do at that moment [laughter]\n[laughter] I sat down and I wrote him an email that said I Am so sorry this is the second time I'm going to walk away from doing this with you I you know send me a bills whatever time I wasted the beers I really apologize I Can't answer

like there are people out there that are wealthy they're nice they're likeable that care about other people I'd like to be J. J. walked that's the kind of rich I Want to be where everybody likes J J what\nWhat else do you want to be I'd like to be fit when I'm old I'm old now but when I was young I wanted to be a body builder I knew that I had an image in my head of me that I had drawn up in my brain\nTen years before I wanted all my body building contest I knew exactly what it looked like and the day I Won the pictures they took our exactly\nWhat I Do ... and early in my life now as an older guy\nI've got to get out some new visions that started the other deserts after going through all this I I start seeing a poodle I Want to be now what do I want to look and I went to my daughter's first body building ... she's ever been in her life and she won the very first cousin she's ever hit a wall and was there I was there was some friends\nThe old people got up on stage how old the hundred fifty fifty to sixty sixty Seventy\nAnd they had one dude was over seven years old and the people that were in the fifty to sixty to Seventy year old contest\nMy friends with them and go to a you could beat them right now and I started thinking about it\nWho I Want to be at six years old do I want to be that old guy or do I want to be that guy that looks like he's physically fit in fact is physically fit who do I want to be at sixty one years of age who how I Want to dress you know\nI like Mark Cuban ... blue jeans and white shirt look\nThat's comfortable\nI don't want to be the guy has to get 'em ... suit everyday suit and tie that my ego stroke with my my suit or would have to wear a suit every single day to feel important\nThat doesn't sound good to me so much rather take a short break when we come back I Want you to write down just a one word who are you modeling who do you want to be in every way\nShape and for people to come back we'll go further down the list right back you know wants to be\n\nHow what do you decide who you want to look like what you want to look like right\nIt's a choice it really is in every way shape and form it's a choice after she knows sixty year old guys up there\nI I came home and said you know what to do a few less meals a week\nA few more exercise programs a week and you're going to look like a sixty year old body builder and said might as well do it it's worth it to be that that a couple of hours a week more than what I'm doing right now because I'm doing some now but a couple of hours a week more eat a little bit less drink a little bit less and boom\nIs it worth it\nWhat do you want to look like next how much money do one half\nNobody ever system thinks that right did they go on as much as I can get that is not a goal\nI asked lady yesterday on the radio show I said did you when you first came and you've never believed in me this was true I said now that you've been around all these people and\nI said now that you've been doing this for a while I Want to ask you a question tonight I'm going to a meeting where there's going to be fifty people party not immune party and everyone is going to be a millionaire after all lifestyles members every one of ... million I said do you can you see yourself being a millionaire and she goes\nDel I Am on the second I decided to take action on being one I became one she is I Am a millionaire now I just did our financial that were millionaires\nSo the question is how much more do they want\nEven them I bet they haven't sat down as 'cause I asked the husband I said look\nWhat is your number\nOne is the number where you'd walk away and say I'm not going to work anymore you already got a million dollars your wife's already got three apartment complexes but you're still working what is your number and the guy couldn't give me an answer that really a straight answer you know it's one of those things where\nYou can never really thought about it have you how much money do you want and caviar that with how much do you want to earn per year and do you want to do it by working or bypass the streams of income\nThe real number you need to understand is what will you be willing to give up your job for because you want to not because you have to because you want to use their income and I asked people this all the time guys you make\nA hundred thousand dollars a year you'd take home\nSixty thousand dollars a year after taxes income taxes Social Security Medicare state income taxes and your four one K. payment you are taking over sixty thousand bucks a year if I could give you sixty thousand dollars a year where the tax free income\nRight now would that be enough to quit your job\nAnd invariably they would say no [laughter] into get it they're living on sixty thousand bucks a year they're earning a hundred thousand bucks a year but they're living on sixty and they wouldn't take sixty did not have to work anymore it just blows my mind\nBut what is your number if you don't have a number then you will never get it fixed it will never work for you right\nLast one is whom do you want to spend this time your life your money your your everything with whom do you\nWant to spend the time with you know that's an important question here I Am engaged sixty one years of age is pretty late in life you know\nBut I found the person I Want to share of the time with I really loved the woman I enjoy every minute with her mom [laughter] that's a stretch to say I enjoy most been through there but that's with anybody's relationship right but the bottom line is that I Know who I Want to spend the rest of my life with now into you figure that out\nYou're just wandering generality I've met so many people through lifestyles that go through a divorce and within three to six months after the divorce and married again it's mostly men men many man cannot live without being married they need somebody to take care of them\nThey need a mom mom I take care of me and so I don't think they actually pick just the perfect girl did you pick the next girl next in line step up your turn to take care of me I Can't take care of myself\nSo did you pick the relationship and are you in a relationship that works at a guy the other day this is bizarre tell me he said\nI'm probably going to get a divorce and I had another guy I met\nThe other day and he said you know I'm living separated from my wife we still see each other very dysfunctional separation because I still go over there and I see the family and the kids on holidays and stuff um but I don't even have a girlfriend inside anymore I used to have a girlfriend that I have that anymore that was the reason we broke up but\nYou know I said well are you going to get divorced or not I don't know well are we is yeah I guess I should really check to what about the money 'cause yeah I guess I should in just living the life of\nWandering around hoping it's all going to work out isn't going to get you where you need to go guys\nRight guy told me [laughter] I go because I think I'm going to get divorced because I Can't seem to get anywhere with my wife so I think I'm gonna get rid of her go ahead and get somewhere like well that's an epiphany without a bit me who can take a
