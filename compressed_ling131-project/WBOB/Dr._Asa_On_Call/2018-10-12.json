I'm speaking blindly with Bill O'Reilly on six hundred W. B. O. B. [noise]\n\nYou know here's some more conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to remember one version of bumps and\nThis is Len Morrow infidel today with Jillian Garland on the ... radio show and today we're talking about how to harness your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will allow you to create the wealth and passive income that you need to live the lifestyle that you desire and of course we believe\nThat real estate is the best vehicle to do that and\nSo we talk a lot about that and it's not that we love a real estate it's that real estate is the investment that gives us the types of tax breaks I'm the type of a runway that we need del talks about it as a train you know that that the stock market goes up and down\nIn a moment based on the news based on emotion\nReal estate is like a train in the distance you can see it coming you can take a vase of action and get off the tracks before it runs you over and uh I I just just love when he talks about that is done several several shows using that analogy and it says it's so true we can see\nThings happening and they don't they don't happen in a moment's notice they don't happen in a day\nAnd I even when the economy changes we don't have all our tenants moved out you know one of the great things about real estate as we all like to have a roof over our head\nAnd that that allows us to to maintain occupancy in our apartment center single family rentals or through all\nMarket cycles it but when we talk about fear Jillian you know as a mentor you you hold people's hand figuratively through\nThrough this transformational process and for me it's the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life\nIs to stand by someone side as they fundamentally change their life\nAnd are able to achieve goals that they thought were out of reach for them\nSo we talked about\nHow we develop those\nParadigms in life the things that we believe in in your experience what are the things that people here are growing up that create a belief system that makes it hard for them to get away from\nCreate a belief system that makes it hard for them to get away from\nWorking for a company you know the idea that somebody expects are going to work for the same company you know their whole life for most of their life\nIs should be gone but yet\nIt seems to be a strong paradigm that the getting that good education is going to get you that job and you're going to be able to move up and invest in a four one K.\nAnd then move it to a self directed IRA and invest in the stock market and retire and I think that's that's still the paradigm I still see articles telling millennials this is what they should do\nAnd where does that come from when people tell you stories\nWhere is this highly ingrained paradigm coming from in our society [noise]\nPersonally I think that the paradigm comes from how your upbringing and how you were raised I'm I was a very very fortunate individual and the sense that I grew up in a very loving household and I also had the experience of being raised with my grandparents as well so I had two generations telling me what I should do in order to\nCheck off all the boxes that I'm supposed to as an adult you know\nThe education was very important in our household so went to college and then there was always the conversation about\nHow it's so great when somebody has a job for their entire life or they just hit their tenure at at this company or whatever the case may be and there is a sense of accomplishment pride you get accolades for that\nThough obviously growing up in a household like that you want to adult do you want to be just like that you're emulating the people that you were raised by\nThat becomes a situation where I wanted all of those things\nNow don't get me wrong my parents do not invest in real estate um they they support me and my decisions to invest in real estate and I think that they are very intrigued um they still also have the fear which is kind of comical because they have seen it first hand how wonderful it is and how much it's changed my life\nUm but it also becomes a situation to where you know they\nAre fearful because they still hear things and they keep sample in two thousand nine when the real estate market crash they're fearful and the sons but what if the real estate market cautious again and you're invested in real estate what's gonna happen\nAnd I just kind of smile because it becomes a situation where you know I'm not investing in the stock market where everything is just gone with a couple of little ... than a couple of flashing lights all my money disappeared from one computer to another it's a situation where I own real estate and I have rental properties and\nNobody is going to do a mass exodus out of my homes because they need a place to live and I've done it right I fall adult map and clean and functional and providing people with safe affordable living though they're going to continue to stay in my tenants so therefore I Will continue to be able to make money no matter what the market throws at me\nUm I also think that a lot of times people are so scared because\nThey always hear the horror stories of you know their uncle neighbors friends brother had a rental property one's Twenty years ago and it was a nightmare and all of these things went wrong and yadda yadda yadda we all have heard that story every single one of us can account for that\nAnd it's just not true that got\n\nAction just didn't do it correctly he might have a ... a rental property but he didn't own it correctly or he didn't buy it correctly or whatever the case may be\nThough I think that the biggest push for change lifestyles are the reason why so many people are\nAble to leave their um comfort zone of what it is that they're supposed to be doing up poor societal norms or ... or their upbringing is there's it's a whole group of like minded people that want a better life as Adele likes to say the only thing standing in the way of a great life is a good life\nSo it's really remarkable to have a huge group of support system family a group as lifestyles as because\nEverybody has the same goals and not to be successful and for other people to be successful as well you know I'm the abundance mentality on success is not apply to become thought type of thinking and that is able to propel you to the next level\nIt was actually kind of funny because I was having a conversation with my mother the other day and she was talking about her um four one K. and she just you know put money into her four oh one K. and she never looked at it as do many Americans do because they can't touch it and tell their retirement age\nSo she hasn't looked at it and years and years and years and she was looking at it and she was so happy that it had gone up and\n... and it did it went up so like I said it it it worked well for her but it also became a situation where I started having the conversation with her if she would have invested whatever she put into her four oh one K. into real estate\nThat number would be ten fold higher but I think that so many Americans are trapped in the thought process but\nOh yeah it went up\nAnd once again she never talked to she never paid attention to it though it's a situation where if it went up substantially or if it dropped or if it went up a little but she's just happy that it didn't go down and how that is that you know you work your entire life\nAnd state and save and save and you're just hoping that it's going to be a little bit more than you put in\nAnd that's not a way to live a life and that's definitely not a way to plan for your future\nSo it was comical and like I said my parents were very responsible and successful individuals in their own right but it was just kind of comical\n[noise] and and you hit on a really important topic and when we come back to and I want to talk a little bit more about that because it it is the uh it's interesting paradigm that we have surrounding for one case in taxes both of those things are\nTaken out of our paychecks so we kind of ignore that that money is really hours\nAnd then we don't understand the dynamics of how they work and that's part of what drives the fear and if we can harness that we can drive success instead\nThis is Len morale And Julian Garland on the ... radio show if you have a question get on the line eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven eighty seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven and if you want to find out more about our activities of the kind of\nTo that four one K. and and you ... you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that had a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement [noise]\nIf you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nJillian can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something new you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated can you talk a little bit about that\n[noise]\nSo for me going into lifestyles and learning the entire process of real estate investing kind of became a no brainer after the fact I Know that sounds silly but I Am I'm super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass of happened the kind of guy I can take you done any rabbit hole of gloom and doom\nAnd I'm also very risk averse so I understand I fundamentally understand where people that are coming from but do you invest in for one k.'s and think that\nReal estate is a scary thing because you know they watch those and Spain HDTV channels where like we're gonna flip this house and that's how you make money we're going to take this house down to the studs and you're going to get off of work and you're going to come here and here to stay here until three in the morning\nBusting out drywall you know that's what people think of when they think of real estate investing and it couldn't be further from the truth\nSo I decided to take it upon myself to go down my rabbit hole of gloom and doom and try to find the loop hole and lifestyles on limited path I wanted to see where there there was something wrong or\nHow the gotcha I'm always looking for the gotcha\nSo it became very appearance me pretty early on that there really wasn't a gotcha because I'm In control I'm the one that makes these decisions and in regards to me being risk averse this was a perfect fit because as we talked about earlier\nIf you're investing in a four O. one K. you literally putting money into that account your own money\nAnd if you're lucky you have an employer that matches it and then it just you pretend it's not there that is the best course of action because what's going to happen as it goes up it goes down it goes up it goes down\nHopefully it continues to go up but more than likely it's going to go down that's actually the gamble real estate investing isn't a gamble real estate investing the tried and true process and\nIt can be proved if you just educate yourself you know a lot of times people come in and they want to talk to me about their fears and their concerns and they're always looking for the gotcha and the answer is just be informed just be prepared for those situations and that's what ... does it\nPrepare people for situations um a lot of times people are scared about things like well how do I deal with the situation is a kind of need me to the toilets clogged and they can't do anything about it and something happened college Palmer\nI I'm not gonna tell you to go get a masters in plumbing and just\nCall a plumber that's the logical set up um but at the situation to where we your correctly educated unprepared for real estate investing you change that toilet out when you bought the house so the likelihood the statistical possibility of that toilet going south on yeah it's pretty slim\nSo you know we if you do everything right from the beginning\nThat's how you are able to be successful and real estate investing and you know every single month that when you're trying to it pays the rent you're going to pay that mortgage and you have money in your pocket because that's the path and stream of income that's coming through\nSo in regards to the tax benefits to it it's a life saver you know you're able to take advantage of tax benefits and light off that you wouldn't otherwise be able to if you weren't a real estate investor and then so when you're looking at that\nLying on your tax returns saying how much did you pay in taxes you're just going to start with only that number down because of your ah deductions and real estate so\nIt is to me it's I at the risk adverse individual I feel that this this significantly less was\nMore ... I ... I'm Sorry I feel that this is a significantly lower risk for an investment than just giving your money to an employer but give your money to a four one K. management company and these people just go in and invest and whatever and it goes up and it goes down so\nI think that this is actually the more conservative way of investing in your future opposed to the conventional paradigms which is kind of ironic but it's true this is actually the safer way\nYeah and and it is because you know again there's those those um miss out there about real estate investing and and that have to be overcome you thinking about the fears that people have\nOne fear that people have about change is that when I go to change I'm being asked to suspend\nA logic I'm being asked to suspend the the knowledge that I think that I have and and the point that I think you just made is that we're not asking anyone to suspend a logic to ... to to ignore the knowledge that they have acquired over life we're asking them actually to go back to some fundamental core beliefs about\nPeople and how the world works and when we come back from this break we'll talk more about that and and we'll get some more encourage meant in tips on harnessing your beer to drive six that\nThis is ...

who are going to stay with our company\nWe're going to invest in them we're going to train them we're going to teach them about our company about what their role is about our customers whatever it takes takes a long time\nSo we want people going to stay\nAnd we reward people who do\nI take this off barrier and we call them persevere and so we have um three five ten Fifteen twenty twenty five thirty and now thirty five or three people in the company who are now being here thirty five years or\nMore than passing perseverance and of course they've been successful with the company they wrote it\nMore than passing perseverance and of course they've been successful because they wrote it all the way [noise]\nSo let me tell you a little bit about these awards\nFirst awarded for three years and happens to be a watch\nBe wearing a today than to watch engraved on the back your start date that's a nice watch it's a cashier at everything we do is sort of special I I spent hours choosing to watch the watch happens to be something called an echo drive\nI don't know why we're talking about here but it's it's it talks about the level of detail that I'm involved\nEcho Dr watch\nIt is run by solar power you don't see it looks like a five march but there are solar cells inside the watch and its charger book even by room by room like in once charged it can stay in the dark and you draw the six months and still keep the time\nWe received a call from our doctor\nAnd he said that\nThe ultrasound showed that David our son did not have kidney my first thought was okay how can we fix that and\nOur doctor said well you need to go into the apparent in college as a specialist to see if you know to to for him to look at it further when we went to the doctor and he checked everything out and confirmed that her son did not have kidney and what we learned was that\nKid needs help actually produce the lungs or or develop the lungs because basically the baby will drink the em the audit fluid and then he'll be it out and the drinking\nAnd that actually develop the want [noise]\nAnd so the issue wasn't necessarily is lack of kidneys but the fact that his lungs would not\nDevelop we were told that we had you know that he would probably come middle mid thirty weeks gestation\nAnd so uh we're just continue the pregnancy and just try to enjoy every moment that we ... that we had with him\nJust sometimes he would move he couldn't move a lot because there was no clue it by we would just to play music for him at night and just try to spend whatever time we could with him\nFor about thirty four weeks in the pregnancy I\nStarted to having contractions and went into labor\nAnd so we went to the hospital to deliver David and now this whole the whole\nTime you know I at that point it has been a couple of months that we knew that David would outlive I also learned about an organization called now it'll Amy down to sleep\nIn that organization provides remembrance portraits two parents separating the death of a baby when a friend first told me about it I was a little hesitant I thought\nIs that appropriate to be taking pictures of a baby in the situation but I went to the website and I saw how beautiful the photographs were and I realized that we would never have this opportunity again to be able to photograph our son and so I decided to have the photograph of our son\nSibling we went in to deliver David out his heart was still beating\nAnd when it was time for me to to push the hold the heart monitor author man because they knew that he could possibly die during the delivery process so they took the heart monitor off and\nThe thing I was hoping for the most was that he will be born alive and so when he was born that they that he did not have a heart heartbeat and he was not breathing\nAnd they handed to him to me and I was I was so crushed that\nOur son was important alive but then at the same time I remember looking at him and thinking wow he this baby was in his beautiful and just like any first time mom would feel about a baby and their their first baby just\nHow beautiful and I cannot believe that I was carrying the baby but then the reality struck again that he was not alive [noise]\nWe we spent the time with him and then our photographer came in and she thought a graph\nDavid and just you know documenting or time with him we gave him a bath we held him\nShe weighed him a we have pictures of him on the scale of each of us holding him of us as a family of him alone and uh we you know we just cherish those moments that we had with him\nAbout six hours after she was born we just we knew it was time that we needed to let him go and it was the hardest things I ever did [noise]\nGive him over to a nurse and know that I Would never hold him again [noise] so at that at that point we uh you know I was being discharged from the hospital and we now needed to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time\nWe were able to speak some of those things through there is many many other families who who's a baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare but we knew\nThe baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare that we knew where we would hit wherever we would bury him and\nSo I remember going home that night and trying to go to bed but then I realized where whereas David see at the hospital to the funeral home pick 'em up and I called the nurse at the hospital and she was kind of her shift again and she assured me that he was still\nThere and I was just wanting to know where my baby was so we went up so a few days later we had a memorial service and we buried our Sunday then\nWe were told that we could go on and\nHave other children that this was a fluke occurrence and I have seen on line other stories with babies who had what it's called Potter syndromes uh where is that\nThe parents go on and have healthy children and his chromosomes ... turned up okay and all the other tests for fines so we were clear to have another baby and we got pregnant a couple of months later\nWe we're cautiously optimistic and um we went in for a number of ultrasounds I was still considered an ... a high risk pregnancy because of our situation but we still would need to wait until the sixteen week cultures town to see if our baby had\nKidneys [noise] so the sixteen ... found we went in and the doctor within their with ultrasound technician and I'm laying there\nAnd he just pause and he said wait a minute let me step in and so he stepped in for the ultrasound technician and he was looking and I kept asking what what's wrong what's going on and he wanted ... but he just kept looking and I said that the kid needs and he said he does and I said okay then what's\nWhat's going on because they knew something had to have been wrong\nHe\nHad us go into another room and my husband and I just we waited for the seemed like forever and then the doctor and he came in and he said\nHow your baby has a sit around the neck and severe fluid\nBuildup and what we later learned was that it's just a kayak or almost a hydra high drops at the fluid and falling around all of his organs and at that\nPoint they were unsure of the gender of our baby because of all the swelling and then the doctor said that his heart stopped beating at any time and so\nUm he said since he can't move and I didn't feel and move it all that I Need to come in every week to see it as hard as it is still beating every week we went in and I started getting more hope because I thought maybe\nThis is our miracle maybe this is what we have to go through to have to have our miracle and and nothing has ever been too easy for me throughout my life so I thought maybe this is a miracle every week we went in and then by twenty four weeks since the pregnancy and we\nLearned that our baby's heart stopped\nAnd so the doctor said you can\nYou know you can still carrying a baby for a while and you'll probably going to natural labor if you don't buy a certain period of time I can't remember how long that was then we would have to induce or you can go ahead and do and I looked at him I said what am I supposed to do is I'm Still carrying em and knowing that he died so my husband and I went\nTo the hospital that night and they enthused labor [noise] and we had a little boy that we named Ethan [noise]\nAnd I had a camera in my bag [noise]\nAnd I\nRemember thinking you know let's get some pictures because when his when he was born his condition was extremely severe\nA lot of the teachers were not identifiable he could see his hand the spelling was selling was pretty severe and I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring now down to leave that to him\nAnd I remember thinking about the camera in my bag that maybe with him covered in a blanket\nAnd my husband and I holding him we could have a picture of him but I just didn't have the courage to do it and I didn't have any one encouraging me to say you know go ahead and take some pictures and um so we never photograph teeth and the and that's one of the biggest regrets in my life [noise]\nAnd what a story
