Texas and um this is a [laughter] a name I'm going to have you used to not use it before but uh we'll get used to actually so Kevin as we are as we start back up here let's talk about you got that you got the corporate or you got the college education of the way you've got a job\nNow you're married you you've done the American thing when that what time did you start to think maybe this is it into\nA probably a pretty early on in my ... to like corporate job so I I work\nFor a white my first job was in high tech I worked for his doctor manufactured probably the only one out here and now everybody's but I Know what I'm Talking about but that was my first job coming out of college I was there for years and years and I think just going through that whole process I'm\nMaking a little bit of money and just kind of going through corporate America politics and the system and\nUnderstanding what's possible you know I always felt like there was something more I was just spending just an incredible amount of time doing what I was doing and then travel all the time and you know seven AM meetings to turn around Seventy a meeting and there's just\nNo burning time at both ends you know and trading a lot of that or or if it was you know very little money\nAnd I think throughout the whole\nThe whole process you know over the course of those Eighteen years\nI knew there had to be something different I I figured there had to be something of an easier way a better way of of just replacing my income if I were going to retire\nYou know how am I going to replace that income that I'm not going to be making you know and high tech you know you're lucky to make it by you know I'm\nFifty five sixty is laws you know out of the question and so I'm not that I felt like my time with limited but I felt like I needed to figure this thing out whatever retirement what was going to be going to make that happen\nAnd start early and then start early is what we always talk about what what what we're taught us\nAnd start early and then start early is what we always talk about what what what we're taught is that you know work and pay them and we did that and we work and we said quite a bit you know with with what we are bringing in [noise] and um\nYou know I think always something out there that I just couldn't put my hands on and it wasn't until you know\nReally twenty Thirteen um that I that I discovered lifestyles on that and and that was only only because of the friend of mine you know when we were walking in and having to quit coffee break down all the way we were talking about\nYou know a real estate investments and things of that nature and he kind of turned me onto it but um you know\nBefore that it was the same thing that everybody else does you know it was a four one K. was areas of us thought it was the mutual funds that was the goal in handcuffs and if you're in corporate America out there you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know they latch on to you and fought the golden handcuffs on you called stock options mendota ... that that can keep your ... or more years because they give you [noise]\nYou know so many shares that will or maybe best and maybe you know be water\nBut um you know at the end of it I was I was making really good money I had a really good we had a really good life I mean we're making six figures easy you know and what we thought was pseudo job security you know without really knowing what was going to happen or when it was going to happen in terms of ... but um\nBut it wasn't until twenty Thirteen that we've lost style and decided to make that job\n[noise] so let's talk about the transition because you know you got to got good job working [noise] you know and you hear about this what was it that that enticed you wouldn't somewhat explained it to I think just must be your friend or work or whatever [noise] uh what was it to the Taj you about this thought process\nI mean I think I ... yeah um I I think I realized pretty quick it was everything that I had been looking for you know the whole idea of real estate and I've I've read if people you know a millionaire next door then millionaire\nUh there was another one out there but I I read those books and stuff and knew that real estate was was something that that I thought made sense I just didn't have the means the knowledge or the education to figure out how to do it\nWithout putting everything that we had saved at risk and so there was hesitation and the skepticism and and it was you know me talking about these five twenty nine plans for kids you know college savings and and and and their future education then you know my buddy was you know Carlos was telling me about you know investing in in a\nSingle family you know property than he has three kids as well we had a lot in common to a bought three of them\nAnd his idea was I bought a house for each kid\nAnd when they're ready to go to college we're just going to sell the house all the equity out and boom there's or college tuition I thought man at most incredible thing I've ever heard how the heck did you figure out how to do this and you mentioned you mentioned lifestyle you know and um\nYou know we got into it you know through through that way you know through hell and then that that little five minute session\nYou know to major Kevin ... as you sit here\nAs accomplished as you are right now that that simple concept at all he wanted out of a worse you know so many of our members want to be completely retired so many of them want to be millionaires\nHe just wanted a way to fund this kid's college that's an amazing thought that it can be as simple as that yet empowering you thought that was amazing\nAnd now with ... you know promote all you've done you can realize that that was a very tiny step compared to what he could have done so it's it's interesting to hear the story\nFrom that perspective so how did you come to lifestyles originally did you go to a free workshop that you bring your case study how'd you how'd you get over here\n[noise] yeah his his membership civil as he he's he's been with us for quite some time since two thousand nine but he's only bought those few homes and I didn't know about the case studies or anything like that are really anything beyond that Arthur helping a lot to do my research and found that pretty workshop and that was my\nThat was you know my my end and two and a lot about the kind of you know see what this was about and and whether or not we thought it made sense and we went through that I'm Free workshop and and that progressed into you know the two day\nAnd um I told my wife I said look at the ...\nI think it was five hundred bucks or something like that at the time and I said look it's gonna be the best five hundred bucks we we've ever spent because this was going to completely change our lives or it's not but it it it's a hundred bucks you know and so um\nWe made that small jumps and that's what it is I mean it was a I mean for for my buddies is by three single family homes for him that was pretty big you know for me it's a five minute conversation which has the potential completely change in my life it did and then it's the next you know small little step that I had to take to make a ... a five hundred dollar investment just to figure out\nThe nuts and bolts of this thing of what it's about and you know in understanding a lot more this what I thought was going to be single family and you know real estate I only had no concept of multi family or apartments or anything of that nature but it was just the course of these small steps that that we took in these small decisions that we made and\nThat that really honestly got us to where we are now you know\n[noise] well you know when you get this thing you look back\nYou'd probably sit there and go like it happened so quickly I don't even know how it happened I the older I get the faster time flies by these dates you're thrown at me or not that far behind you they're not that long ago and I know the manual were three or four apartment complexes now many on right now\nWe own well I mean we're uh we're owners than sixteen bills more than three thousand units we we own or manage two of them currently ourselves so we have our own property management company and and we own owner managed to those\nSo three thousand you to sixteen deals\nAnd that's like a blink of an eye in your life if you think about the lives of your children in the destination of your family that's a blink of an eye\nTo own three thousand new sixty properties unbelievable will do short break here when we come back I wouldn't have Kevin keep going with the story and explain to us how we got through those extreme numbers and so we'll be right back and Kevin Germans and the ... radio show\n\nDo\nFinances are probably not even on the table for you the more you're probably that point that many deals that much either you under your belt that you just don't even worry about it\nUm the other one is that\nRetirement is not the end but it's really the beginning you think about what you were able to do right now Kevin with all the time you have to think about a new business to create a new business to go with your family do stuff\nLet's compare time wise because now before even if you want to do something and you were ... brilliant engineer you couldn't do it you had to get up and go to work now something hits you in the middle of the night you get up tomorrow morning and you attack at like a dog talk about the time difference in being\nYour own man\nI yet again it's it's it's a night and day difference and that that that really is what it's about I mean and in corporate America America you're you're trading all your time\nUh for what seems like good money and and and that's what it is and you know I Would\nI'd be out the door before my girls even walk up before I could get them you know before they even ate breakfast you know headed to work just to avoid the morning ... you know what I mean we catch 'em to catch a seven AM call you know work my twelve fourteen sixteen hour days go back home you know\nMost times you know not even be able to to get some you know before they go back to bed before I'm coming back into the door I'm you know catching better or not you know sometimes some cases only to hop on another phone call at seven PM and [noise]\nAnd then that's the circle is is this just vicious corporate circle that just turns in grinds and\nAnd um it's it can be um\nI I don't know people keep people get used to that and uh\nIt's a it's a time the empire I mean I spent a lotta time traveling overseas traveling the world and when I was younger that was great got either world got to see a lot of things but you know with my kids and everything I Want it to be home I wanted to\nSpend the weekends with them instead of being stuck in an airport you know I wanted to be able to wake up in the morning and in and make the decision whether or not to go to work you know do I have to go to that meeting is that really important and I put it off to Margot I Need to do it now you know and\nI can do all that now you know I'll give you a quick example we were we were going somewhere I forgot what we're go we're going out of town on a weekday and uh we're stuck on the freeway it's probably eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning something like that\nAnd one of my girls goes ... who are all these people when we're talking about who were all these all these people all these cars what what's going on we're stuck in traffic\nThis this morning traffic and they had no concept of mourning trap you know what I mean because they had never done that with me before\nYou know like these people were going to work this is what people do this is what most people who this is not what daddy does you know daddy leave\nHe goes the property that today oh when all that God and he comes back before that traffic it because they they didn't know the concept of a morning traffic because they've they've never been exposed to it so [noise]\nYou know stuff like that I mean in terms of time it it's been it's been a big change is that an an amazing change for us in in one that I did really anticipate happening you know just from a retirement\nPerspective you know my my playing with fifty five that's when I was going to retire but I had my spreadsheets engineer spreadsheets number of all that stuff calculated I beat my plan by fourteen years because of lifestyle\nWow ten years I retired when I was forty one you got me be right thirty four [laughter] but I I was able to get out of their forty one you know personal choice no layoff notice that burned me writing letters manager was saying you know what guys\nI'm going home [laughter] you know what I mean and that's what it was it was making that decision uh hey I don't need this job\nI don't need the job I don't need this anymore I have the passive income I had my first deal with the lead investor you know we had a plan in front of a a sat down with my mentors at the time you know multiple times to say I am I crazy you know I I'm seriously thinking about doing this job a very very comfortable W to\nInsurance the whole thing too I'm just going to throw it all the way a job because I Believe in the system because the system in the last two years has done more for me than the last eight team\nAnd that's how significant that was for us and and we made the job I mean Lara retired shortly after we join\nShe retired and late twenties their pain and and the plan was for me to get out and um I made that happen in June of twenty sixteen shortly after closing our first deal but it was because of that half of them come\nThat got us to that opportunity that created that opportunity for us to make that kind of decision and that's a that's a big decision that was a very big decision but it's been\nIt's the thought you said it it really started after I retired you know what I mean I made more money after retiring did I ever did in the Eighteen years I was I was at that company\nYeah that's a really scary part is is that if you look back and be like I thought I was getting somewhere but heck I was scratching the surface on the opportunity for making money that's that's crazy part did you start out as a passwords elite on your first deal\nUm as far as passes by me for for all that was back to replace them betting that that income right I mean that that was the goal is that we had\nThat dollar amount per month and in terms of expenditures that we were trying to replace them so through we jumped in the multi family you know when the two day you always talk about going with the end of mud and then we took that to heart it's like look we're in a place where the savings\nThat we've been you know hoarding up for quite some time that we can go with the end and mud we know we need to be a multi family that's where we need to go about your job and so we started or lots of us\nWe're going to have to jump out of this segment and into another we'll be right
