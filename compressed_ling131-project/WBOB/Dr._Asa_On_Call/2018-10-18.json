he will go\nBack to do on the radio show with me here today is um Mr Scott bad Oscar he is the latest news the most current multifamily mentor other Houston market area scot doing with the lifestyles for a long time on stubborn apartment complexes going after a few more right now and has been helping people diligently even before he was\nOn the mentor a team so Scott\nI'm going to ask you the probably the hardest question to ask any mentor\nAnd I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyle may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd it's really difficult because you know he said well I Would agree to myself that no one ever has failed deal and you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything or you'll never be wrong\nNo one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and that's what I Love that but\nUh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for it so it's not insulting a there they really really really really really want to help you get what you want\nTo the point where maybe they're not\nUsing enough of their own personal um ...\nConservative ... to ... them from making yeah restraint and and being able to if you look I Know you really want those I notice when really you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up the hearing the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you [noise] um [noise] you know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... people put through deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do what you don't want to do it uh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and make millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card and how many people that I've consulted have become national park association winters so\nAnd how many people that I've consulted it become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you yeah because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and and this and what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to kind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals by deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term success as a any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money [laughter] I really look at this and Curtis does a great job in a multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it and so I look at every deal that way whether\nOr not and that now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals that I've mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you gotta give 'em a little shut off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like as if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people that I Know we'll do this today\nAnd uh and then they could potentially jobs and they're going to be great [laughter]\nUm the hundred and sixty four ...\nScott Scott ... you're just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know what do you do with someone who won't take actually hit him with the cattle ... what does that and I used to say it'll tell us if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let those when get away so I've always called the cattle ... move\nOkay started a hundred or a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal\nAnd we we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at at analyzing the numbers\nAnd a way and we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUm this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market were up an act or\nYou know ... for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that that's what I had to do a little homework on\nAnd when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that I thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull them back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm alone quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we're going to take another run at it this afternoon and so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet\nUh we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were pretty heavy on and I did we didn't get very deep into it but I\nCame out on the road trip and I said the steel too rich there's not enough\nUpside to this deal to make it worth their while [noise] and uh we would call a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to do diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my kind of position here is to make sure that people do get a little too anxious or lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal under contract and I was completely blocking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory a Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou know I remember during your rise and so forth you were you an interesting personality your personality fears and nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you in you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end in which better be careful that hurt other conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field but we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this um about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember time flies you know the last\nCouple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kinda the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying Partridge out and then you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nAnd then I'm looking at your your your work for the day and then you got like one new deal you just close into more deals you going after\nWhat did you do do do you do consulting changing but we had to go to a break so I don't know what you're talking to break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Jews are taking our new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going\nMan the market really is good right now let's get going so what's the hold out one back if you guys want to ask got specific question our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven\nI Will leave the phone lines open during the break and\nWhen you get in well for you to write up when we can go next segment we write back was got Ben Austin is a ... radio show\n[laughter] [laughter]\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever to you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not good even guess what percentage I don't know how many units are not going to guess buddy it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all the taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would be like to take the money\nAnd the sophistication and the experience that we're the cumulative in this group and take some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or without being insulted elites they have less experience than we do\nAnd be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area and ah you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed them last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston\nAnd Dallas and San Antonio in going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going to uh you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd they're now saying we opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things that creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened a A R a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald and when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to do and so ah anyway as I Am sorting and and I didn't batch delete I was just hit and delete delete delete scrolling through the subject line the Cincinnati deal pops up and I went home and I clicked on it\nAnd I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas it was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was upon us a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying this deal out of town and we've got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nAnd she said whatever you want to do if you want to manage outside but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right and she said that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there\nSo things are manageable if you'd like to try and do it so we ended up doing it um I went to my three\nUh kinda largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys a little bit of a flyer but boy you back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year we're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high yield play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up there we put it a little bit of cap it acts and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks and our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased threats that we are getting out of this place\nSo that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my masters who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded the lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him\nAt the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and it couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI got to tell you a J. B. data Durham\nHad a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to the night before the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed have got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on and we have members as as you said that found that show uh most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into her drive to and I did their their studies they invested in some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan\nUh well what do you think that a place to take a break right there's got to come back we'll finish up on Detroit and the other national stuff you've been working on right back with Scott and often the Dell wants to review\nOf [laughter] [noise] [laughter] [laughter]\nYou're listening to the radio show will be back with more people are supposed to just\nYou know that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money five wave cash flow of money in your pocket each month equity captures the thousands of dollars you when you have a right he meant by a white property using them right map appreciation we it was the increase in value overtime\nAll right property using the right man appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime\nEquity fail to pay down your mortgage each month\nAnd finally the tax advantage when done correctly real estate investors pay\nNo taxes on our cash flow and capital gains lifestyles unlimited these are the five ways we make money in real estate which is why real estate accounts were more millionaires in the world today than any other investment vehicle you should have some real estate in your portfolio to learn how to attend to lifestyles unlimited free workshop\nCalled eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\nAnd register for the next available more jobs\nThat eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n\nYou have to decide I Will get it right now is the world over the world was going to crack\nDown on the question here you see how you can connect with down off the air on your radio dot com click on Twitter\nDown\nI Believe the good teachers as you said to be able to breathe through multiple levels of words that are completely different from one to nominate down that\nWe know you're out there\nHiding in plain sight living a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grave\nThere's a better way a better life at lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income lettuce show you how it's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\nOr tension all man here by a grand for your lead you down but your best days are behind you think again if you suffer from any type of the the regardless of the reader medical history but doctors\nOf the alpha medical group can help you in now\nThere is no needles no surgery no medication just knew it was debatable proven treatment from Europe using a boost the energy wave power after the ... medical device regenerate its blood vessels in a red tiled tissue was short being office sessions\nAnd it's all done with virtually no needles no surgery no medication told now from falling from Asian call and I know for seven six three fourteen hundred nine or forty seven\nSix three fourteen hundred one hundred percent\nNatural none of these are worried about six or a tile is function go nine or forty seven six three fourteen hundred today in your\nLife back when the alpha medical groups called and I know for his seven six three fourteen hundred for a visit our website in alphabetical group dot com\nIt's time to start planning your two thousand and Eighteen Christmas Party and the Salem center is the perfect location we have an auditorium back can be decorated beautifully and we can post your get together for a U.S twenty people or as many as four hundred\nPlus the Salem center has that wow factor you will want for your holiday party may sit down lunch or dinner yes we can do that a mix and mingle of and we can do that to an auditorium style Christmas program of course you can do what\nIt also with a memorable style at a price point that it's very reasonable to give us a call now we have space available but we are filling up very quickly the number eight six one zero zero eight six one zero zero\n[noise]\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one ...
