some of the hallmarks of these devices that were sent that mean number one is the obvious one Mark I'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated in and and exploded again thank the lord that happened\nUm but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but other things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught\nUm outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we've seen of the devices mark\nYou the uh just hallmarks of of of of just a rookie tied behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the be pronounced hype\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to secrete a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male hands or the target you don't use height that\nAppropriate detonate in front of a male handle or the target\nYou don't use hype that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed that John Brennan at CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious the basic Internet search would have produced that information he worked at NBC which I mean is it it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\n[noise] well let me ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded work that somebody wants to look so amateurish\nWell it's certainly possible I said there's only one of two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught\nFor some reason or it's so amateurish that it's ... it's ... some kind of a you know motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd in the selection of the of the targets um you know of course there's people want to you know if people all over the media right now are given out these ... especially if you're going through these other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive to have no idea\nBut I Would encourage all of them take this very very slow or because I when I what I see mark in my experience in the space especially with the secret service and all of its mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have these Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient in the way they do it and none of the ... marks of tactically efficient up planning where you are and this is a\nHighly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that certainly doesn't speak the stomachs expertise in this in this space\nInvestigator and you're looking at this I Would think you would make no a imagines a scenario say you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and figure it out that way rather than\nWhile this mode of that motive and the other mode and you're really you're you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you and I do um we're always hesitant\nTo jump to a motive before we actually have the facts and the data there I mean this is what common sense reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark the most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how\nTheir most important thing obviously is who did it who the actual person it\nWe'd have no we have zero close right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of the initiate are on these devices which usually leads the signature\nThat they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is and I got to tell you it's grotesquely irresponsible for these people out there already were absolutely convinced\nThat that they know exactly why this happened it's just it's it's insanity\nYou also find it a really gut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they try and tied to Donald Trump\nNow rose Donald Trump yesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable TV [noise] he was said to be a racist multiple times on cable TV because they use this word national listen I'm going to explain this later in the show\nI'm aware that where it actually comes from comes from the progressive actually comes from Theodore Roosevelt his new nationalism speech but I don't want to jump out and getting into that later just shows you how ignorant people are but they were going on and on and and now these same\nHosts the same guests the same contributed call them whenever you will are talking about the rhetoric too hot things need to be coal do they understand the media have led this this this battle with the vicious rhetoric\nMark they've they've accused the man\nOf being a Russian trader a a a guilty of trees and we've had we've had so called air quotes you respected commentators accused a man of treason accusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces mark what other things you\nSean and the people in this industry of always been clear on on the conservative side of the people responsible for their own actions\nThat maniac who shot up his needs college and the baseball field\nI that guy's responsible for his own action\nBut having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation and public have to be more responsible but that's not conservative than the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make some kind of a political issue without having any band hounding factors disgusting ...\nOne of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during a campaign some fringe name sleep whatever his name is this guy yesterday on TV I think it was on TALK shows refused to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and other public officials in restaurants that was just yesterday\nI heard it I saw the exact same what you're talking about but that's who he is the fate of him before mark ... who he is I was not surprised one of my brother well we appreciate having you on then you're great friend God Bless you we'll be right back\nIf you're like most people and you

hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nIs significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why and met a share is so\nDangerous word nationalist it's a very very dangerous or you got to listen to me throughout the program I'm going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead\nWe know this president is\nAll I just want to be precise on Congress or in your ... between the primary in the United states and Hitler and I want you to explain exactly what you mean because obviously this is a this is controversial\nFor what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and the national is meaning that you know when you listen to him he was talking about and German from the germ is a and that\nI Am on\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans\n\nThese are historically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nServing historical echoes somebody well founded ... a lot of things over the years in the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with the liberal movements people like feed or hurt so the founder of ... who helped to create a state or federal air boulevard who helped to create those sites of Colombian Venezuelan\nBut on the twentieth century nationalism is taken on a much darker much more negative connotation bingo socially of essentially a fascist movements and you think of national if you're going to people I'd Franco in Salina and Hitler and Pinochet not exactly people at the president of the United states which applicant evacuating\nAnd that's why it's very hard for me to think of people and he was so straight for the describe themselves as nationalist this was not a popular term with Kay\nOkay well I'll explain one very big one who was on the twentieth century in a moment and then we have Joe Scarborough really low some really low some individual cut Nineteen do\nWant to read this this is kind of a this is this referencing nobody\nCan sue please\nPlease my my beloved viewers out there do not\nDo not draw parallels between what is said here in these anybody so he's\nWillingness to attack Trump and he thinks he covered by saying don't draw parallels well why else would you be doing just to give us a history lesson on Hitler\nGo ahead isn't that would hurt me\nVery deeply and you don't want to hurt me deeply I don't want to weep on the shows\nThis this doesn't throw like anybody whatsoever it's just [noise]\nIt was going through it rains and rains and volumes I Love World War two and ... the um being Churchill fan love what\nRosa so I was reading this this is\nFrom um ah the United states has a strategic services in describing\nThis happened to come across this lady's gym because when you think uh Joe Scarborough you think of a historian particularly when it comes to World War two don't you nobody sent this to him or put it under as rather huge bobble snows no no no he found this on his own go ahead\nBile and this only pertains Adolf Hitler paints and nobody else I can I just can't say that it up for this is what they have for Adolf Hitler's psychological profile and for those of you in the midst of\nReading World War two\nOf government reports you'll find that fascinating as primary rules were never allow the public to cool off\nAnd never admitted to a fault or wrong\nNever seen that there may be some good in your enemy never leave room for alternatives never accept blame\nConcentrate on one enemy at a time and blame them for everything that goes wrong people will believe a big lie sooner than the little one\nAnd if you hate it three times that you know\nSo there you have ... comparing Trump the Hitler even though he denies that that's the entire purpose of this then Don Lemon on CNN cut twenty go wow\nI'm a national\nUse that word we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been uses a slur\nOf of sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nOkay now keep in mind he's or media figures\nThese are hosts some claim to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk is cooling down the rhetoric is is bringing the country to get is this news isn't even news at all\nThen there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC I'm getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do this stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one go\nAnd Peter to ask you also about his hazing that weren't nationalist saying you know out loud I Am nationally and how does the president conceive of that term because it doesn't in any way have racial undercount\nRacial undertones racial overtones the word nationalist\nGo ahead\nAnd they're telling us that are not just racial there's enough over 'cause this is something that the president and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pay them pay you get\nThe draft and there's many others so yesterday Trump is compared to Hitler he's a racist he's ... he's all these things\n\nAll these this is the media the media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media and tonight they're out there saying toned down politics as divisive it's too late now they're reporting and they're not really reporting slowly but surely they're aiming at Trump\n\nI'm not a nationalist ladies and gentlemen I'm a constitutional asked I Believe in Americanism not nationalism\nI Believe in Americanism not nationalism\nIn the correct Max Boot and everybody else who heard speaking\nOne of the leading progressive with the last century progressive he ran as a third party candidate is the head of the progressive party was Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd on August thirty one Nineteen ten those of us who actually do study history Scarborough\nHe gave a famous famous speech you know what he entitled the speech the new nationalism\n\nThe new nationalism\nAnd in this speech the new nationalism Theodore Roosevelt borrowed\nFrom a gentleman by the name are Herbert cruelly if you have my book rediscovering Americanism you know what I'm Talking about\nHis and his essay is\nFamous essay in something called the outlook magazine promise of American Life this had an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt the progressive movement was really borne out of the Republican\nParty early on and it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd then there's new nationalism speech I said he called it his new nationalism speech he spoke about the new nationalism the object of a central government\nThat need for a ubiquitous federal government they need to be interfering in the\nPrivate sector a rejection of market capitalism in many respects a rejection of the ... I'm telling you the truth I rejection of the declaration of independence has written a rejection of the separation of powers that can finds\nThe ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was on the on the left on the progress of let their new nationalism\n\nSo why do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler why do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be that's a progressive term that progressives own that word\nIn the twentieth century\n\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory Meeks is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\n\nThis is a phrase a word\n\nThat is central to understanding progressive as ... and the central location of the American government they're intellectuals wrote about it all the time\n\nExcept the president's to be criticized softly it should be using a word out of progressive ism but no the progressive so run the media for the most part the leftists\nThey want to compare him to Hitler Hitler\nHitler who rounded up millions and millions of people and slaughtered them\n\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one
