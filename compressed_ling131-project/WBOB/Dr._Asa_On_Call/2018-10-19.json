... she is one of the single family mentors that Dell's company lifestyles unlimited where an education and mentoring company for real estate investors\nAnd Laurie I'm so glad that you're here with us today\nWell hi Lynn thanks for having me today I wanted to talk about the power of passive income\nAllow you to live where you want and invest where you want\nAnd there's so many things that throughout our lives prevent us from being in the places we want to be yeah we move for jobs we knew for a variety of different reasons and often those moves are taking us away from the friends and family\nThe activities in the sports and the recreation that we enjoy\nAnd we're suffering through and one of the great things about retirement is is most people envision retirement as this time where they're spending time in those places that they love\nAnd if we talk about passive income and\nThis places that they love and if we talk about passive income and how to create passive income so this is creating\nThe the wealth and the cash flow that you need to retire\nYou want to be able to create that no matter where you're at and Laurie is with us today to tell us a little bit more about that is she works with people every single day to achieve this goal and she is giving back because those who came before her past back that map to her and she is now passing it on so\nLarge and you you know I really feel like people need to be responsible we we have to be responsible for our own outcomes we can't rely on our employer the government and our kids to take care of it so that's\nThat's a big one that well here is people are moving from places that they love because they need more help them more care and they're moving in with their children and having to move where their children are at\nAnd their children are not necessarily living where they want to live because they've followed their jobs\nAnd so you get into this this cascading cycle if people not never really being able to be where they want to be so\nIf if we take that responsibility or ... and we accept that that we're going to do something where we are going to take care of ourselves and we're gonna set ourselves up for retirement no matter what age we are right now and that we can get this done in in you know two to five years\nWe're going to need dot passive income so can you start by telling us a little bit about you and your story and then talk to us about passive income and what it is and what it isn't\nOr hospitality drug use Angie or Beverly Hall now eight six one zero zero one zero for Angie or Beverly

because it allows us to live where we want and invest where we want\nAnd we spent the first segment talking about\nThe little bit about Laurie Ann and her history and moving around for jobs and never really being able to be where you want to be because something is dragging you elsewhere in order to make money\nAnd if you can create passive income that that cash flow that it's coming in every month without you working in that business or working very little in that business\nIt gives you tremendous freedom\nTo live wherever in the country you want to live close to the people that you love and the things that you like to do and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie [noise]\nWe've been working with a variety of of national uh folks people from across the United states and some from out of the country who are investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now wait we launch our national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works and and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\nSure well you had mentioned in the last segment how we feel that people if they are in a market not conducive for cash flow property and for investment by an old property\nWe don't expect them to give up their life and their job and move away from family to go move to a an area of the country that that that meet the model and so\nThat's why we teach people but you can do the\nModel in a city that make the whole market snake and so we we teach them the price point you've got to do two things in order to him that outside of your market and to analyze whether or not you're a market is a good one too and that are not\nSo I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices are home\nTo an ... or not so I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices they're home prices are out of the ... out of the sky high and they go through the roof they're with their home prices and in order to get a Nineteen fifty nine will be a little bungalow you could pay half a million dollars for that\nOn a red prices went market doesn't support being able to pay for the expenses on a hall of that a lot better off than it doesn't make sense to actually invested in that area\nThat that that's pretty simple what normally we'd look at the average eye of the house what it's going to appraise or on the market\nAnd we can generally ballpark look at that and say well rent would probably in order for it to make a good investment property what needs to be about one percent of the price of that house so he's got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollar house that you're going to purchase or an acquisition by on hold for cash flow\nYou'd want to consider that you need at least Seventeen hundred dollars a month for rent and the people in that area aren't paying that amount will then that means that the house is too high priced for the model\nSo what we do we look for areas that great if it happens in your own backyard because\nThat give us an advantage or more familiar with the neighborhoods we're familiar with that which which areas are good and bad so to speak but the thing is is that we can always if it's not in our backyard and if it's in another city\nOr another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market and the what the rent our\nOr we can look at rental comp you couldn't even find that if you you use search just a normal website like real true dot com or or something like that the what rental homes are going or in the area\nAnd then look at what price as a homes are selling for and then you can put that one percent will and see whether or not it makes that\nSo um you get your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics\nYou might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance or something on your team but that's in the area and see what the insurance rates are going for that you can start calculating what benefits would be a for that property\nTo see how much that the expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check tenet will be painful though once you apply the same principles to any market you can find a good markets and invest it\nAnd if you can't find um something you know lots of times people get stuck because they want to invest in their own area\nAnd is so many many people are living in areas like you say where the the numbers really don't work out well for rental property which is why many of us live in areas that don't have a lot of renters in the area and but\nAs they expand out from from where they live they can find many markets usually in a variety of states across the U.S where it makes sense and maybe there's some on the east coast in the west coast where your numbers are just so high that when you're charging four or five thousand dollars a month for\nRent you're you're into a dynamic in the market that's that's difficult to as a landlord it takes you longer to find tenants even though people may have higher incomes they also have higher higher expenses and so they they get into a situation where\nYou have their traditional tenants taxes\nAnd and toilets where they're really looking at appreciation to maybe you could talk a little bit about our model and how we look at appreciation of as being the cherry on top instead of the foundation of the investment strategy\nExactly well well we all know that real estate is and appreciating asset so appreciation though is icing on the cake you don't want to go into a a a deal\nThinking that it's going to appreciate because that that of a speculative nature that we don't want to speculate on anything we want to run good from numbers and I'll tell you as long as\nTheir property in the price point to to uh to afford\nTo to make a profit off the rent than appreciation shouldn't shouldn't come into play that just simply what ... what you get in the by on hold so for instance if you work you add\nIf ... if you go into a a market and it happened to be\nUm let's say a hundred and under two hundred thousand dollars and you look at that market will say well you know prices are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating\nOur ... and and so you would want to still not go in for ... that mostly people are just going to speculate on that and then they they run the risk of getting burned be run the numbers the same on every deal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThe fundamentals of the market that prevent us from repeating the past and that's really what Laurie is here to talk to us about today is\nMastering the fundamental so we don't repeat the past and being able to live where we want and invest where we want and that is the power of passive income this is Len Merle and Laurie ... now on the ... radio show in a moment we'll be back with more on\nThose fundamentals of real estate investing if you have a question give us a call at age seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that age seven seven seven eleven eleven\nFind out more about ... real estate education and mentoring program called eight six six nine four five six five six five to eight six six nine four five six five six five Margot to retire in five years or less dot com we'll be right back\nConnecting up with an on line with some of the real estate investing groups that are in the area and you want to be able to ...\nSo that then you can run the numbers on each deal to ... to see if it makes sense but that's not enough just to find the property and do that you've got to be prepared to take action and once you do find a good deal because if the deal is going to go pretty quick\nSo you have to make sure that you've got everybody they're having their final all lined up but it sure that it's a lender that lens in that area\nBecause they're going to want to play the route to the property to make sure of the value these are all checks and balances that we can use to make sure that our mission is going to be a good solid sound investments\nAnd we're not going to lose money on it\nSo we look for these properties we get our ... only start wars are due diligence as I mentioned earlier we want to make sure of the insurance costs\nOn on that particular area um there are instances like hearing the DFW multiplex where you will do for ... to ... like the heart because ... county happens to have more uh more tornadoes and hail damage than we do ... and all\nThat each specific area you're going to want to hold on and on those particular aspect of the property so once you've got your team you've got a lender you're going to need if it's going to be a we have ... what are you going to need a good to be a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with something that's not quite so ... we'll fix up and yelled at all you need a handyman you'll need to check out for schools that are common in that area and these are all done by people are just\nEqual the is it common for foundation problems in that area that might be someone that you want to because they will go out and then back\nTo the people they can be your boot calling your ... on the ground for you actually need eyes on the ... someone able to go out there for you\nSo we believe everything ... right in our own backyard with all the way in our area the thing is you put in a little bit more ... to ... before you get into a property\nAnd that's I Know that's that's a powerful concept yeah and and uh I I to share a puzzle that the lone wolf\nA reputation that real estate investors have because we require such big teams in order to succeed you know you've got you've got your lenders your insurance agents you've got your contractors your handy man the trade to reverse your foundation folks your\nPlumbers and your electricians and it sounds like a big team to put together but it is not that difficult to put that team together\nAnd holding them together if you do what what we learn to do from Dell right which is to treat people while you pay your bills you have good communication you're educated and so you know what you want to do and you can speak with them\nIn an educated way then they enjoy being part of your team they enjoyed the transitions they see you making\nEye in your own business and in each property I should go whether that single family or multifamily and\nYou know you you talk about time getting to know the market at you and I went through an exercise in Las Vegas where we looked at property and in\nAbout an hour we got a handle on the market we learned some things that just delighted us and we we actually had a lot of fun together and evaluating property and we found out wow you know insurance is a lot less in Las Vegas than it is in Texas cities\nAnd you know every area has different things you know Phoenix has been a really fun market to evaluate I've enjoyed learning about Kentucky and um yeah we're looking at different areas in St Louis and Kansas City and of course it Lana we've been\nMembers who have been investing in land for quite some time and I'm In Detroit since the recovery have been some amazing opportunities as well and each one of those markets has its own\nIts own flavor and so you may have a little bit more expensive in one area and like they may be a little bit higher and property taxes but their insurance is lower some states are lower in both\nUm it's so there are a focus of our attention right and so as we go through this well look at you know where do we want to invest\nPersonally where what markets you we find exciting what market do we find interesting and where did the numbers work and that\n\nIs you can't fall in love with those homes the numbers have to work for you and said Laurie you know when we when we talk about the numbers that is a way to level the playing field across the country right\nOh absolutely and and that's one thing that we tell people to ... is getting emotionally attached to keep the ... all the time people will when I got a wonderful properly they say that well I wouldn't wanna live there myself at if\nYou can support the rental market and see that people are renting in that area then that means that the people that are living in that area that would want that how it shouldn't be about you what should be about a good clean respectable place clueless\nAnd I had a I'm a realtor when I was first getting started and\nHe pointed out a house in our ... you know I just don't know I it's I same thing right I'm looking at it on a highway and lived there and he's pointing at every other house in the neighborhood and he said every single one of these homes has a family living in it and this one\nWill to the question is are you the one who's going to make the passive income from this property or not and I thought that was a powerful question that we should ask ourselves in that
