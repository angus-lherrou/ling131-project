on the show and many times the really good today I've got a couple of 'em like they do just as really over the top ... sure where that would work through ... through and these are the kinds of things where\nYou have to just take this from took this for granted that I'm going to lose my mind on this right approach so for the type of person doesn't like somebody who lose their mind probably not a good day for you to listen to show on the other hand if you're somebody just hates the fact that it's legal\nFor financial planners to lie and misrepresent the truth\nThat they can do it on the radio they can do it on TV they can do it in articles and no one ever comes behind them in fact checks anything they say\nWhich makes that ridiculous if if I were to just be you all types of facts on the

out re fi they're telling you that see it's the members who have actually done it year after year after year for twenty seven years we've been doing this\nThat the facts are revealed\nNow these people can't misrepresent because they are partners in these deals most of them do and so their partners are getting these financial reports getting these returns and that's why we're still here twenty seven years later it's because we're telling you the truth but these financial planners\nFirst of all I Know that none of them know anything about making money none of them I'm willing to take any one of them you can find in this country I don't care if he's Fox News on down put him on the radio with me and I will destroy them\nWhen we talk about the facts these guys know nothing about how to make

back to do on the radio show today I'm just losing my mind over this\nMisrepresentation so financial planner stockbrokers and the whole industry out there who's telling you lives the one line specific is that real estate or that stocks are way more profitable than real estate is and this has guy it was like seven reasons the main argument\nThat they come up with as you look historically the stock market has progressed at ten percent per year and historically real estate is appreciate it ... percent here they're just killing everything that we do with real estate we don't buy real estate hole for appreciation\nThat is just not what we do these guys do not understand the thing they're talking about\nAnd a real estate investor doesn't buy a piece of real estate and hope it goes up in value hey maybe you bought your home and hope it goes up a diet but that's not what investors do and if you're in the best and that's what you're doing then you don't know what you're doing either right so the next when they're talking about his lowered transactional costs to go you know you could try to stock for five dollars\nGo look you could buy stock I make no money at all have no evidence\nRight pay taxes on what a regained you make\nBut by God you can buy that Dr only five dollar trade\nWow that's really a ... or you could buy a piece of real estate that puts out ten to twenty percent twenty five percent sometimes a cash flow which is you know the highest casual do go out there right now CDs for about two thirds I wanted to point nine the other day for a long term like five years\nA burial liquid would go back to that liquidity arguments very liquid but you know you get a you know five your CD or two percent\nOr where it's this real estate stuff we shoot ... between eight and Fifteen Percent sometimes you see the deals like we bring on all the time but over Fifteen Percent twenty twenty five ... well they don't have any of that we have not only the ... percent appreciation we're forced appreciation and you saw there yesterday with the people were saying they they pulled out\nIn two years I think it was a two hundred and fifty percent return for there are two hundred sixty eight to be exact now if I remember right and uh you don't see that the stock market there's no two hundred sixty percent return in the stock market so what's the difference if we make and I think that they said they made it totally ...\nWhat's the difference if we make and I think that they said they made it totally had like two million in the deal I'm let's just say a million let's say you put a million in a deal and you make two hundred percent with that that would be two million and now you've got to pay fifty thousand dollars to get out\nOr you could buy some stocks that don't make you anything pay you know to evidence you have to pay taxes or whatever money you might gain if you do have a game and you can do that for five dollars\nWhile that just doesn't sound like that impressive bubble point on seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate the third one is it's less work\nWhile now how the heck you come by that\nThe bottom line is if you're going to go pick stocks yourself the amount of research you'd have to do would be on the oddly\nI Know when we were when I was day trading back in the day I'm you know we were reading the newspaper every day all the articles and journals you can listen to all the news you could try to figure out what was the next big play it was a full time job trading stocks\nOr you can handed over to somebody else and let them do it for you which means there's less work now in real estate we're the same thing we can go out there and operate our own business and be a hundred percent involve making a fulltime job or we can hire a management company to manage our business more than just be the asset manager portion of the deal and\nIf we don't even want to be asked manager which is just telling the by telling the management company what our goals are we can become a pastor investor and let the lead to be the asset manager the management company manage the property and the on site people do the work\nHow can they say that there's less work than none zero we don't have to locate evaluate negotiate contract close finance operate anything\nThat's not less work guys\nThat's more work\nTo go out there and figure out what all the stocks and bonds and things you want to put yourself in doubt again you can just blindly turn it over somebody else with them do it all for you and then there's no work at all granted but that's not an argument that makes stocks better than real estate this guy doesn't understand\nWhat the options are whoever this guy is I've never heard of this guy before Sean man you shouldn't be writing articles about stuff you don't understand it just\nI don't know if the rest of you out there irritated by it or not but you know you're here every time you get on the radio or TV you hear the same stuff\nAnd what's funny is you know I'm the guy on this radio station here he talks about you know it's either the left or the right left or the right now it's not even a left or right it's a left and the right they're both spewing the same garbage out day in day out\nTheir forest reason\nIs more diversification they're saying why are you can't own properties how lose San Francisco Rio Amsterdam all over the world but if you own stocks you can only to accept any company in the world again\nThis guy has no idea what he's talking about\nOur members are investing it deals themselves investing and deals with other people and they're investing deals that had the diversification of different operators\nThe diversification of different locations the diversification of different types of deals in other words a value plays a new place and the diversification geographically whether I Want to have my stuff in California I Want to have much tougher for to Atlanta Houston Dallas\nWe have maximum\nMaximum diversification and again this guy has no idea he thinks he all he could do was buy something right in your own town where you live\nBecause he doesn't know what he's talking about so was my bitch about today my argument is not that these guys are right or wrong they are definitely\nWrong put together an argument that proves that they're not wrong that they're right\nMy argument is they kicked disputed this stuff on radio and TV and the Internet without anybody being able to come back and argue the point against them they have suffered themselves within their own little zones of mediocrity\nWhy because they make their living selling you this stuff that's why this is how they make a living they don't make a living by picking successful investments they're not investors\nThey don't care if you're stocks go up or down they just care if they get paid they're getting paid whether your stocks go up or down\nThey're getting paid right\nJust crazy stuff the next one which makes no sense at all number five is the ability to invest in products you love\n[noise] [laughter] [laughter] what you care what you were invested\nWhat do you care the product you up okay we can invest their products we love hey I have a senior citizens property I used to have I loved that I really loved helping senior people we are low income properties oh man I really love helping low income housing people to get a nice clean place to live\nHey we've got some resorts stuff man I Love owning some resorts stuff\nI can invest in the stuff I Love it just so happens what I Love is something real what do I mean by that how would you like to have a boyfriend or girlfriend or a spouse that wasn't real it was just a piece of paper\nOr a computer program and it's the same stuff to every day when you got out of bed good morning Mr ... I Hope you had a good evening Mr ...\nI Hope that your life will be wonderful today Mr what because there's just a computer program which is rather tat tat tat tat tat tat none of it real that's what you got from the stockbrokers financial planners\nThere's no real investment there but with a piece of real estate my friends you own something tangible I've never lost a piece of real estate never had one run away never had somebody steel one they're All right where I bought them and they stay there until I sell\nUs my friends these guys don't know what they're talking we'll be right back if you don't want to do radio show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] do you do\nThis guy even bother to do any research report he bright something Sean Sean come on Sean\nReal estate investor when done correctly don't pay any taxes on their income you pay taxes on everything you do every single transaction that you make money and\nYou're paying taxes on how the heck and you say there's less taxes and fees oh there's a because there's property taxes they don't have property taxes you don't need property taxes because you don't own anything you own a piece of paper\nAnd the only gay and you get is capital gains and that's all taxable by the way even if they threw out some evidence that would be taxable\nBut the property taxes\nWe pay come out of our net are gross proceeds to allow the net proceeds so we're we're talking to you about the rate of return that's net of the property taxes you dumb completely ignorant person writing articles\nThere's no way you should be allowed to write articles hey if I were going to write something I Would go look up the facts before I went and wrote something it made a fool out of myself this is just the most ridiculous article I've ever seen in my life there is no seven ways why stock you're better real estate he named up seven reasons real estate is better\nThan stocks and my friends if you can't see that\nIf you live in that war will he lives in I'm not going to call you agree I'm going to call you financially\nInsecure I'm going to call you living a life of quiet desperation that people become real estate investors when done correctly the way we teach it between two and five years generally replaced the earned income\nReplace the earned income with passive income wow now that leads me into the next article half\n[noise] this was written by CNBC see NBC up it's an article about Tony Robbins and his feelings about what is\nA financially secure or you know wealthy\nPerson and Tony Robbins talks about the fact that he thinks it\nBeing wealthy is a feeling a ...
