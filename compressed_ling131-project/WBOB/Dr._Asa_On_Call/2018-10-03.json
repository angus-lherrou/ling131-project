Germany grand car down with maybe opening somebody you've heard of\nMeans that the the sales a motivator does coach got started in there in the car business or a and that guy that real estate and he wrote a book called ... and ... and it basically the book was\nUm how much money that he had the example you'd ask somebody how much money as a lot of money to you and for many people that would say a million dollars or five million dollars and that is that that\nAnd for many people that would say a million dollars or five million dollars and that is that's a really big number but that to work toward to the child or to the family of somebody or hundreds of millions of dollars is that really a big number\nAnd so when he was thinking what you need the extra way of thinking you got to change your mindset right because you're only going to go as far as your mind's going to let you go and so instead of choosing one million why they choose ten million how can they didn't treat the hundred million um and so the concept is is uh that that you just got to be able to shoot higher because of your goals\nAren't aren't scaring you\nAnd they're not big enough you're not going to achieving at the very most out of yourself so I think that was one of the books but I think I read\nSome time back that maybe a few three or four years ago that really woke me up and we're like wait a minute you've got this ability you're voting this machine that's like you know being able to operate these apartment complexes and generate tons of costs are pretty investors\nYou know be able to provide for for for yourself and your team why aren't you know scaling it up a little bit you you you can do it you know do I think you've done the same thing I mean when I joined the business you know when I joined during your group you know you weren't nearly as massive as you are today now you're all across the country now you've got\nEverywhere you got member from multiple countries and and and you know nearly every state in the in the country and I mean doing all these great things all because of what they learn it lifestyles right but somewhere along the way you decided you\nWant to wrap it up right so I think it's a similar it's a similar or a concept\nSo Robert [noise] as you as you look at this thing and you're you're producing this result\nAnd you talk about legacy not want to leave behind something less than what you could have left behind how do you bring your children is in in what age I I mean I don't know how old your children are going to get a couple of guys but um how do you see bringing up kids into this\nMan I ... my boys are everything to me I've got a twelve year old I've got one that just turned ... and they're really crazy good soccer players\nUm but what I think I've been able to do for them is that you know like my mom did it for me they have an expectation to when they have an expectation that fight they have an expectation that to scrape and do what they're going to have to do and so I think that business um you know a has brought that out of me to another level\nYou know I'm constantly what me when I'm we're I pick 'em up for soccer practice I had a day of work I go get them every day I take my kids' soccer every time I don't miss that as often as I can I don't think I don't miss very many games either I'm and I'm\nWorried that car and when I get them I ask them how their day is going\nAnd we didn't talk about it and then it's march or how how's it going with me and we sit down there by ... business ... business conversation with him I tell them what's going on I go you understand what I just said you understand why that's important they repeat it back to me and you know where it it just so much fun when you when you\nHave a conversation with him one day and a week or two later they're like hey that means this and this and that are like yeah that's exactly what that ... you know\nSo it was like what did you start lobbied I Love ...\nI'm Sorry what age did you start teach what would you like that the question was what am I going for a long history of bake it yeah I I Would say maybe\nI mean we have conversations all the time I think they certainly ramped up it wasn't by design like am I talked today I think uh\nYou know it's probably been there since they were like five six or seven probably where they could really understand and and it's like okay so you're saying that daddy owns these buildings right here right and he's like yeah yeah do you know understand why that is important and we go to the concept\nOf paying rent and working for your money and how viable money is and how you had to have somewhere to live in and just you know be able to to to explain the benefits as well you know of only that piece of real estate you know and so it's like they they get it I mean I I have no doubt I'm growing up that they're ... they're going to have a will\nTo want to work with me I'm In the future because I think it's just you know the way I I Do with my ... I wanted to go I thought I wanted to work or whatever I mean what what little boy doesn't want to go work with is that I don't know why that would help our over to my dad was a you know like I was always like either you're not going to do that I Know why because this is a good enough for you you need to shoot higher\nLike wow really they are yeah yeah\nYou know that it's okay you know when did we get on a store and all that and and he was like no no you go find your own path you know you so I'm curious to see how that's going to play on the future I Would love to have them in the business but you know it we're going to have to see how how the card\nA stack up later on I'm curious to see if if ah if I push them away way my dad did they can you can do bigger and beyond or but I think that they're going to be the continuation of of of what of what our company is and and the and the like say behind it\nCan I see a president Martinez someday do other than my hearing we wind up\nYou know it's all funny used it is so funny you said that right because I I think you know I I've got one that has so much swag right and he's got so much confidence\nAnd he just like man I think that's an expression what he's going to be president that states are you going to run a prison gang wanted a Chu I figured it out but he just got so he can just inspiring he's like you know\nThe leader of people in his little school right that I could totally see him in that capacity the other one is very straight arrow\nVery like by the book doesn't have as much creativity you know I'm a just does either good soldier he's going to go do exactly what you do to the death of his ability you know I'm so it's really really funny you said that I could totally see\nOne of them um if somebody puts puts it in his ear and it's something he desires that he wants to be I could totally see that\nYou know looking at it as an upper Spanish a little bit but I think other than that there there are they got a good shot at it\nThat will give you were going to get the signs out now Robert getting done early so that we're in position to be able to put area than I Do it [laughter] and we can take a short break we'll be right back with Robert Martinez ... radio show and\n\nHe didn't\n... actually I actually was it Robert I wasn't thinking of that just count on that it wasn't okay I I don't consider the solution situation I considered one of the turning point to your career where you told wholesome stuff coming out of you that I'd never heard before\nYeah you know for sure I I think finally said you know reaching out to eat go above and beyond the model our model it's up by working class property being the property you know buy properties where my mom was the same as most everybody else as well just some some refinement here and there but we're gonna fix anything that's going to break or the next five years\nWe're going to make sure that there's no reason to move out right we're going to take care of all the air conditioners because that's the number one maintenance headache\nAnd if you're residents if it's not eighty six degrees in their apartment in August and it's a cause Seventy two they're more than likely to renew right and we make our money and there were new game so it's it's a you know that process is a little bit different when you're going to do it in a market where everything's already knew\nRight where where they can afford the rent level at that number then they then they can afford the rent not written that rent number at other similar properties which are also knew\nSo I think the the the business model of you know fix and everything that broke in and and get into a new rule is very different in the a market um I I think I think you have to it's ever it's much more um\nThere's a higher emphasis on leasing leave the nice thing because you're you're dealing with people who have more options money gives you often have you a lack of money doesn't give the opposite of the Evan plenty of discretionary income\nAnd you can be can pay rent or you can choose to buy a house when you're ready or you can choose to move to a different part of town you know you're not locked in I think one of our business models also depended on the schools that that that we that we uh we we we like to buy in the suburbs\nSo school but school districts are very important to us you know families two and three bedrooms right I think this property that I'm that we have sold recently you know there was a eighty percent of one bit\nSo there's a there was a lack of two bedrooms right and it was very interesting the Tibetans are always full rights I don't know why they just didn't do it more choose but\nUm you have more one death which means you have more of a nomadic more of a um ... not a transit coming up the word but you know more of a of a of a of a demographic that's going to move quicker and it's a younger crowd right so as a as a you know young people want to meet people that want to couple up they want it\nWhich are to get married and moved out to the verbs right so I think the model we had to learn we had a um\nWe had we had to play with a model on the fly which um I didn't anticipate I thought we would go in there and be the low cost a provider which you know I think whatever occurred I think we got caught in the economics\nOf the economy and what was changing you know when we were doing underwriting on that deal boy was a hundred dollars a barrel only by finally get into the property a few months later we're at Seventy dollars a barrel\nBy December of that year with sixty dollars a barrel ... a year later an hour at forty dollars a barrel so you know where we had all this monster job growth now we have monster job law\nAt the same time we have fifty thousand brand new units coming to market which are also planning that hundred dollar oil sticking around and we're all kind of playing with the draw trying to fight for a a reduced or diminishing rental population so what we learned you know all that just use the back or what we learned we had a market much better\nThat meant we have to understand how to contact the people that are going to be living with us\nSo number one millennials younger crowd for all of a social media is you got out of your social media game\nNumber two you have to understand that when you have to be there in a fight you on different websites you got to have a good website they expected to be able to pay online they expect to be able to they don't want to go to the office and drop off a check\nThey don't want to go the opposite right or maybe ... some of them are going to do that as they're coming out of the most of my working all day long they don't have time for it and they want to be left alone\nRight so we have developed this virtual online presence so bad to resolve that property we develop a twenty four seven call center or they can call it any time of the day whenever they wanted even after hours\nAnd they can come in and and get information or set up a tour for another day or they need to train a maintenance request to hurt the very idea so that particular property made us better\nMade might be the portfolio better made his ... in that in a better translated into record performances and higher Castro for the investors\nKnow when we toured you your property and the bus tour you've just added a whole different armed to your team explain that to people that they're three different people you picked up the you introduce as to what they're doing for your company though\nYeah for sure so you you answer like what drives me in that business what drives me is building the business growing adding the pieces you know competing with the bigger players right and taking market share from them take an award from them taking what they do and then I'll turn your spirit and just you know basically shutting it back to them\nI really really like ... billion to visit the part that back in December I realize that we didn't have a true marketing group you know I'm really strongest sales and I can I can I can train my girls and how to sell but I needed some help on understanding the\nOnline marketing and so we were able to bring on a few people are two of them\nA a word am um they were they were writing their writing a ten thousand you know for a photo\nAnd they were the marketing arm for that and I realized that we didn't really have Web sites all we had was like you know kind of like a mannequin kind of like a a shell of what a website was I didn't understand all the Google Analytics and all these other things that were behind a website that they explained to me like whoa so they told me that that you could get increased leads\nDid you have at our website that has certain key words in the ...
