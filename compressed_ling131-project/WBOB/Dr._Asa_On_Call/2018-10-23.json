the water\nBack to ... where the hype is to help begins said today I'm Talking about all kinds of just actual stuff\nAbout your life about my life and about the things that I picked up I didn't go in the last two weeks now uh because I was in the hospital for a period of time and it's an interesting story because all of my life or not all my life in later years when I was no longer competitive athlete and I'm\nReally was retired at a very early age I didn't have a lot to do uh I picked up the habit of drinking alcohol and alcohol never affected me quite the way it does everybody else I was able to drink get drunk get up the next day and go to work and do whatever I Need to do or get up and survive I never had hangovers I'd never really had any problem\nBut I just came to the conclusion that\nAll right this is stifling me in some way shape or form and I always talk to people but why do you smoke why do this why are you fat while you that whatever and I just wondered what would be on the other side of not drinking so I decided to stop drinking\nLo and behold when I stopped drinking what happened was you know your body is used to getting all that sugar each side as you sit down and have a glass of wine\nOr your drink whatever it is you sit back relax and your body goes off thank you I Need to death so relaxed or\nSo when I stopped drinking ... and I just stopped cold turkey and people said do you know you should do something about your drinking maybe go somewhere look let me tell you something I don't know what's right for you what wrong for you or whatever but when people told me I should stop drinking I said I Am not going to go to a real quick because\nSick people and they're sick people teaching sick people to be sick they're telling you that you are sick they're telling you that you have a problem that you can't overcome that problem and that your goal for the rest of your life as you get up every day and not trick\nThat is not my goal I stopped drinking multiple times of elaborate just because people say you drink too much what it is okay out several shirt and I just stop\nAnd I've stopped now for three weeks and I didn't have any kind of a reaction to it whatsoever they said well you need to be in there they need to get the drugs while you stop drinking blah blah blah\nWhatsoever they said well you need to be in there they need to get the drugs while you stop drinking blah blah blah blah blah and\nAll that stuff you know might be right for somebody\nBut my drinking was on purpose\nBy drinking was because I wanted to come in relax my brain is going a thousand miles an hour I was built to go out there and wind\nWhether it be athletics or business or whatever to be successful my brain goes a thousand miles an hour goes twenty four seven I Can't sleep in fact when I stopped drinking I went three days in a row\nWhy slept one hour at night that was the one side effects of that I couldn't sleep because there was nothing there was no doubt owners in my system to take me down and it never bothered me the next day I was up I didn't feel like I didn't sleep it's a weird weird deal now what am I tell you all this\nBecause when I went to them just as a couple of things like that you're out over the last two weeks\nAnd one of them is is that too many of us believe that were helpless\nAnd that we we're cripples that we needed crutch and that just isn't true\nYou know I'm sure there's somebody out there is going to say do you're crazy you have to have these rehab clinics you have to have these twelve step programs guys that was during a three to five bottles of wine at night I stopped cold turkey\nThat was at the bottom line is people drank not because they need the alcohol\nYes eventually your body starts to crave the I'll call and I used to get the five o'clock rabies is like my fiancee would always laughing because it's five o'clock\n... abide by get to five o'clock and I could get a drink the booms all okay everything's fine but the ... like ravens is all they ever got these I I Know people that get up in the morning and start drinking vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds best shape of her life there's no\nThere's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in life the reason I started drinking 'cause I'd already made all my money I had already won all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off\nAnd there was nothing left me to do get up in a day do my radio shows and get back to society go to a few events where I Would help and talk to people and teach and motivate whatever that was it the rest of my life there's really nothing for it I I worked in my garden and I've got you know giant yard they spend most of my time working on\nBut the point is is that I decided to stop\nAnd just see what happens how many of you can just stop doing this stupid stuff you're doing like paying off your mortgage like putting money in a four one K. U. R. blindly addicted to the stupid financial stuff that you're doing as well as most people addicted to alcohol and drugs\nYou can't stop yourself\nWe had a seminar out in uh Las Vegas\nI got emails back for people who are like oh my God you can't expect us to stop contribute are four one K. you can't expect us take our money out about four one K. you can expect us to not have our home paid in full do you are drunk on ...\nYou're out of your mind drug up on somebody else's belief systems because those belief systems do not work and will not work towards becoming financially free and especially rich wealthy above and beyond the average person\nAnd so it's like dropped off in this alcohol which was interesting was is it I started eating something at night that I'd never eaten before I started being like fruit nuts and stuff stuff that we normally think is healthy\nBut what I realized as all that stuff is the kind of stuff that irritates something called dire ridiculous or something like that ... stomach disease and it tests in disease where there's power ups and stuff and all that stuff got in my stomach and all of a sudden I had a ... a um [noise] that you know it hurt\nAnd it hurt really bad so I went to the hospital emergency room and they took X rays and said yeah you've got a hole in your chest and so now I'm sitting here in the hospital for six days under massive medication like living on water liquid diet jello that kinda stuff [laughter]\nI'm just sitting there going to like you know number one I'm so happy that I don't have to worry about my businesses my money my finances or whatever that I had the time and the energy to be able to take care of stuff like this but was it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out soon but it's a drain to train\nOf the infected materials out of my body him on all kinds of antibiotics\nBut I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I I could run a mile right now I'm back to the doctor said I've been over the bridge that you'd be feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in Iraq you can see me running or walking with holding my you know\nThe thing that feeds stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like try to get it some exercise and right now the guys are paying your Dover cheaper to yes I Am\nThat's why I had to take alcohol was to stop being an over achiever and slow back down\nBut now that I've stopped drinking for six weeks or whatever it is I don't know three weeks four weeks I Can't tell anymore it's gone it's over um now that it's over now I'm sitting there going oh my God I'm an over achiever again what am I going to do with myself and so your brain starts to expand back out if you\nEver could let go of the addictions you have to work and four one K. and Iran and all the other ... then that over achiever will come back out on YouTube we'll be right back with a do on the radio show\n[noise]\nYou know tax free that I was making you know ever at my job by double\nThen it went on about a forty unit made some money and then I went and bought a six year and the sixty four unit was really the that was the criminal the crown that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff this one property I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down\nTo buy that today you'd probably have to put probably five hundred thousand dollars down to buy that property [noise] um but I bought it and after I bought that one I bought the one across the street and I bought the one next to it and then I bought two of them around the corner so here I was\nMaking like fifty thousand dollars a month with five apartment complex was phenomenal it was phenomenal just money was just roll yeah and it was tax free money right there it was a boom boom boom boom boom just rocket\nAnd at that point I Try to you know I pretty much quit in my brain\nI'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the ... and here I was making fifty grand them a tax free\nAnd I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people I tried to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me\nTo the next level to where I should go right and then\nAt lifestyles mentoring all these people some people came in were way more aggressive I lost my badge I had decided that it was over the season of my life was my growth was over that's the season I was living in [noise]\nI had more real estate anybody else in the group ah had prestige people knew me I was doing seminars um I was on the radio you know everything seemed like okay you've arrived\nBut then some guys came in and started by way more realistic than I did one guy came in about two hundred and forty units are ... are in one apartment then a couple of months later bought four hundred and eighty units and all of a sudden the guy was\nHad more units and I did\nAnd then he bought a portfolio and it just went on and on people's just certain following these guys and buy more and more and more and more real estate and I'm thinking wow this is incredible\nBut wait I'm totally happy I shouldn't worry about the fact that these guys are making more money and buy more properties than I Am ... why shouldn't even care and and then rationalize myself I don't care I'm not greedy I don't care what these guys do I like helping people make more money than me\nBut one day somewhere along the line the season of my life changed\nAnd I said you know the only reason why I don't want to go out there and do all this because I just don't want to do it all I'm at that point in my life where I've locked wiped down it's simple\nSo what I did was I went out and found a guy and you guys know ms John Johnny Lama Ridgway and I talk to him out of working in corporate America he was vice president second largest management company in the country I should look why don't you come to lifestyles\nAnd I will set you up a portfolio properties all by them you manage him will be partners in the deal and then you'll be able to give up your job because you need income I Will produce a job for you income for you and he agreed to do it took me about two years to get him into a place\nBut then we went out we bought for apartment complexes in a row\nAnd daresay were destroyed with these apartment complexes my whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money in four years\nThat I had made in forty years previous to that because now I was doing this not only from my own self satiation\nBut for John and all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there and do something we had to do something big and we got out there and the excitement was back so here I Am I'm In a new season of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now\nPlaying a big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys I'm running the big giant deals and we bought a hundred and forty unit two hundred and fifty six year hundred two hundred and Seventy unit to three hundred and twenty unit so we just kept growing and growing and growing and growing\nNow during that time\nWe made some massive income and today I right now buying I bought for more properties this year so far about I'm trying to buy my fifth one right now and I was looking in my personal financial statement and I just looked at this and it just blew my mind about how incredible\nThe money made on these properties where and when we come back from the break 'cause I don't want to short\nA short this thing I Want to go into and show you we made so much money in a eight year period of time or whatever it was I don't know what it was two thousand eight to two thousand\nAh see we got a sixteen about eight years we made so much money and eight years it just blow your mind and that was an additional season of my life\nAnd it wasn't until that season was over that I had ... that season\nIn my brain and
