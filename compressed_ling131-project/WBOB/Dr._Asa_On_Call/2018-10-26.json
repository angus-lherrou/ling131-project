business and of course history and we do with this day in history every day and we love Bush and we've done David McCullough and the Wright brothers and we've done that great great book about mark\nTwain's west an epic tour in his life to we'll get some money back because he'd been broke from so many adventures and misadventures in the stock market and in business and a book review corner attention in the wall Street Journal and the title was the Franklin house divided and here's how it started\nOn the fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six Benjamin Franklin was in Philadelphia having helped to draft a declaration of independence while his son\nThe governor of New Jersey was under arrest in Connecticut having been branded an enemy of his country for pre existing in his royal duties and opposing the revolution in less than a year William Franklin we'd be taken to the notorious\nWitch feel go a destination for among others traders who would abuse their privileges and lighter incarceration\nAnd that led us to the gas the joins us now the book review was for the loyal son the war in Ben Franklin's house and then you'll mark Epstein joins us now thanks for joining us and\nIt's a pleasure to be with you and then he'll tell us what drew you this book\nWhile I was interested in Benjamin Franklin from the time I was a kid you know it's one of the most first of all American man who was great and better [noise]\nUh [noise] and probably the first great scientist in terms of electricity and of course everybody knows the story about been flying the kite [noise]\nAnd I remember seeing that would cut of Benjamin Franklin followed flying with ... with his little boy\nAnd I wondered what would it be like to have Benjamin Franklin as a father I mean a man who was not only a great inventor but um [noise] created the militia in Pennsylvania and order to defend the frontier of Indians and then you know created the first postal system in Pennsylvania and [noise]\nThe University of Pennsylvania and then of course became one of the greatest American patriots during the revolution but would it be like to be that man's son oh and then of course I found out that I'm Benjamin Franklin's only son was illegitimate a bastard\nBut that he was raised just as if it legitimate sun and the two of them were partners in politics in military affairs a later in diplomacy [noise]\nUm so it was an extraordinary father son relationship and the fact that they went different ways during the revolution and the [noise] William Franklin became the governor the governor of New Jersey while his father of course was the greatest patriot\nDrove them apart and I thought what a tragedy what a great story so actually wrote a poem about this in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd do you have that problem with me right now [laughter] no no I mean it's it was published long ago and [noise] as often happens because I was a poet before I became a biographer\nAnd in England his son rose very quickly if he went to the bar and got his law his law degree in his mid twenties and shortly after that was appointed to be the governor of New Jersey so at that point in his life he was in his late twenties\nOr his father was a fifty in his mid fifties he was even more powerful in the in the government than his father was so he had an extraordinary career\nAnd so let's get down to this conflict I mean by the time we get to the damn backed as we indicated before\nThe country was in pretty much open rebellion and the civil war was brewing\nAnd William took the stand in bend took the stand and talk about their final meeting in particular was remarkable before we get to that build up to that if we can set up that I I think almost just tragic scene between the father and son\nWell it's really extraordinary the extent to which the two men were living in different world speak because I'm by Seventeen Seventy five [noise]\nTwo years before the actual a declaration of independence or we had been living in America he was the governor of New Jersey and he'd been the governor of New Jersey for more than a decade\nAnd trying to represent the king's interests in America and trying to prevent this revolution which he knew would be a disaster and a lot of people even Benjamin Franklin up until suddenly and Seventy five [noise]\nFelt that would be a big mistake for America to separate from the mother country me while\nHis father is in England and his father is\nStill working on behalf of the columnist representing the colonies interest in uh in England uh against parliament and he's seeing more and more corruption in ah in England and in the meantime the the the\nThe English government is sending troops to Boston\nAnd the rest of America in order to enforce these uh taxation laws and he's growing more and more bitter against the uh the English government so that the two of them were living in different worlds\nAnd [noise] when it finally came down to the ah Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd the declaration of independence a Williams thoroughly on the side of the king and the crown and his father at that point was a confirmed American patriot revolutionary\nSo they just want different ways even before that I think it was a certain amount of jealousy between fathers and sons as sometimes happens tragically\n'em and um his dad but I think it was a little bit jealous of William\nSo let's talk next about this father and son there at loggerheads what happens to William next as you stay in the country is moving to more clearly ready for war Williams not\nWell first of all his father came home in time to try to talk his son over to the side that ... would be the safest that is the side of the revolutionaries\nAnd the two had some very very storming confrontations I'm In Pennsylvania and New Jersey oh where where his father visited him and he did everything he could to try to get him to come over to the side of the revolutionaries because that was his side and the family side and William refused\nAnd William uh ended up being the last um the last royal governor to do the kings business in America [noise]\nA stubbornly refused to leave the governor's mansion and had to be taken away bottle am was put into the worst prison in America the ... field jail\nWhere he was in solitary confinement a with bread and water for Eighteen months a and suffered terribly during that time um have finally was released prisoners exchange but his father had very little to do with a pen eventually went back to England\nAnd they said they're really heard Ben Franklin I mean hey it's his son in no matter what kind of jealousies might have existed to watch this before this kind of played for your son had to be difficult moreover he's a very public figure and it wasn't as if his son was some wildflower he was a governor who is now in jail how did you all that\nWell Franklin said nothing I'd ever heard him so bad and his entire life and you have to believe that [noise]\nAnd it was a lot of public criticism of him for not for not helping his son out but remember he was the minister plenty of potential jury to France\nAnd could not be seen as being in collusion with a you know with the story and so he was a horrible ... it's really a tragic situation a which really is kind of like the um [noise] uh the revolutionary war in microcosm\nAnd do you think he really understood the sons or should\nI don't know I don't really think I think too that part of the tragedy of the book and what I finally end up saying and the end is that these were two men who could never reconcile although the sun want it to William on it to more than his father did they could never reconcile because they they just\nExtreme this break between father and son can be bought it happens\nAnd and in the end the father didn't understand the sun but the son didn't understand the dad either [noise]\nI don't think so I don't know what a what we haven't spoken about is that at the end of the ... became a counter revolutionary violent counter revolutionary and his father could not could not ever forget\nAnd indeed he couldn't and by the way father son stories well they're reverting\nAlways drawing everyone in I mean this is Arthur Miller made his living telling fathers sons toys that gets into Bruce Springsteen's made his and this is as good and his harrowing father son story as I've ever read a Daniel market obscene the loyal son the war in Franklin's house thanks so much for joining us\nYou know\nWe love to do these stories about history and there's always so often we bring you this days in history by Hillsdale College but stories like this are always brought to us by the find folks in Hillsdale too\nAnd my goodness one of the things I had forgotten to ask\nA Daniel was what the similarities word today\nTo then uh in large measure that populist movement of the revolutionaries well it came about because they'd been felt like they'd been governed by foreign and for a power and that's of course the British Crown and in large measure today a lot of the populist movement\nMany people believe is because there's a foreign power called Washington DC and many people in this country feel like\nThat foreign power or that far away power isn't responsive to their needs and to their lives again as always these stories the stories
