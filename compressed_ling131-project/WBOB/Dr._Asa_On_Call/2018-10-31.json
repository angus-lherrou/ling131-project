I'm an actor by a lot of houses and I don't want to work hard\nI mean I ... I\nLiked what he looks day but it just I just didn't see how that was going to work for\nYou know we kind of amazed by the end of the second day that either or the end of the first day either going to be my family or at least it wasn't going to solve all of our car it might make it better but not out that\nWhat was the moment I don't know which one do we want to pick this up or maybe both of you should highlight it because it could be different I always like to ask you sitting there let's say the second day and boom the light bulb goes off in your resume you you talk about [noise]\nThe second day and boom the light bulb goes off because in in your resume who you talk about um you know you decided right then and there on that second day that you were going to go ahead and upgrade and go out there and get started what was the light bulb went off bath and he said boom now I get it\nFor my life the ana why\nAnd how apartment they value\nTherefore it here and I'm like that evaluation got back and I literally standing no harm I Will happen and it won't\nFigure it out I Can't tell what about a million dollar arm and come back we'll have five hundred thousand dollars at a bar you about five hundred thousand dollar\nOh about what their money and I was like I Am\n[laughter] I don't think it can be done\nNow did you share that with Gregory Gregory did you ever ... had second day\n[laughter] I Know that\nI was saying that if any I that that really caught my eye and I guess the other part is uh how much passive income over now or sort of you know a different way of looking at things and I've never\nBeen exposed to that and that really changed how we approach things especially since after we've joined lifestyle [noise]\nYeah they're little calculation and I came up with a Twenty years ago has probably changed more people's minds about their finances than anything else\nWhere you take all of your passive income from last year and divided by your network the average person makes less than one percent on their net worth per year so it's a frightening realization or for us that are highly invested by the way\nWe would be considered incredibly good if we capital ten percent return on our network but we fighting somewhere between one in ten percent is that fight to keep everything you have reinvest it did not let your equities grow in your house and not let you wreck with these grown your documents\nOr et cetera et cetera et cetera and to keep that stuff blooming so that's a great epiphany so you guys came out of their decided upgrade um let's talk about then\nThe next step how much education did you pick up on because you guys are highly educated people we have massive education how much of the education did you use before you went out and bought some\nOlive oil we literally out of town from our first mentor appoint ... we had a teacher I'm at a time\nAnd he gave me a whole ... thing and a whole take it that he has ... ... am\nWe talked and literally on the way home we have a store and buy\n\nAnd immediately started reading and watching everybody and we both watched all and that\n\nThat's interesting because I'm I'm In the process of buying a class who apartment complex right now my fiance he's been in the business for twenty twenty five years as a manager in as a supervisor you know when I made us both do right before we while we are in the process of buttons and went back and took the whole multi family series again\nThey're just not enough education out there you forget things it sharpens saw you ready to go get attack and so and so forth outlets talked about road trips did you go on any of them case studies did you do them\nLet's hear about your thoughts of knows\n\nWhat Congress should probably talk about taste I mean I was used to it and he did a study\nBut be ...\nI went on several case studies before a totally mentioning it to Tibet tonight and getting her to do to the free workshop just you know seeing family after a family where single family has has changed their their lives and their retirement pattern\nAs well as you know multi family ah deals in a case study them sharing you know than the numbers and such and you know saying deal after deal that had been positive ah\nAnd then once we were joined lifestyles and became preferred members ah we've been to every Dallas road trip um\nUnless we were like on vacation or such we probably been to eighty plus or more are also I've been down to San Antonio central Texas road trip\nTo three times now and uh shortly after we joined went down there and we haven't been in about six deals out of out of San Antonio and if you met some good passes down there and we we tried thoughts\nSo the the\nCase study and road trips a very very useful you gain knowledge is well it's also a networking time with a you know everybody involved with lifestyle\nWill get back to the network he aspect and second Greg Rob I wanted to ask you this uh Bethany as a a financial I counted I guess you are I don't know proceed up an account and Greg or as a business owner can you imagine\nSomeone come up to you and say Gregory like I'm thinking about becoming a you know that can you show me how to run one of these things and and best and you can you show me your financial statements let me look at them and she or payroll and your expenses and your insurance could you give me all the insider information or\nWhere to go to a break right now I Want you to think about that when we come back I'm going to pose that question and\nThe questions of basic simple question of were you surprised at how open\nPeople were with their own personal and business financial information and business practices will pick that up on the other side if you want to call our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to a lab and we'll be right back with Gregory Bethany and the ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nWell I think part of a number of exactly what you fat and they're always deal selling on there I always opportunity to ask if they fit in your lifestyle call so there's no need for me to not tell you from paying it can't it may end up helping me again writer\nGotcha\nSo let's talk now much changes topic oh go ahead Greg good morning I'd go ahead\nWell I think it goes along well with the case studies you know you're not a member you come in and you see these families up talking numbers in and you know spilling their God\nThey're they're doing it just you know because they're grateful that they were able to make this money on this deal um and I think it's just it sets the tone I'm\nA you know that's sort of what we do here in a you know and what's expected and\nUh I just I just you know that\nI don't know how you say it you know I guess that's what I expected as a little harsh but uh it's just a friendly caring type atmosphere\nLet's go down a different route now and let's talk about you brought it up earlier Gregory Gregory um that about networking\nMassive massive massive opportunities that network both on the road trips case studies the advance the expo everywhere and that led to you\nInvesting with thirty three different lead investors can you sort of par set out for us how did you get to thirty three different people\n\nUm well they ban an aggy or that sort of sticks out a day that love you hate you but uh\nYou know like you know meeting people and you know they're all all open and uh I don't know but then he helped me out here how did we make thirty three just being active\nI mean well being at ... ... ... I think you know it goes back to I in a way almost tape that's like a part time job I'm part of the money will now if I get to meet people\nAnd that's one of the things that you do to try and decide if you want to say ... you know how much do you like and how much she liked what they're saying are they actually get it like you are and why didn't they ... him again you know ... you know\nI'm I'm a cart you know we email that may ask questions of farm um got their resume you know the whole time or kind of lucky with a who do we like here that we like it and what we're looking for\nBut so many ... job is also centered around food and an entertainment so it's not a do it when I Want to do it so to speak not to ever even an eight to twelve\n... even they are relying [laughter]\nSo you guys have a I think you guys about probably answered my question although I have an answer for the audience I always ask people do you believe more in the horse or do you believe more in the jockey meaning do worry more about the deal do worry more about the person leading the DEA which one do you guys believe in most\nWhat what do you what is more important to you the horse's jockey\nWhere's where's black Gregor I think is more about the horse that Jackie and you know the lead and I are the numbers are saying\nYou know why Mitt sitting there trying to make sure that I can make the numbers for just the way they said they were ... park ... about what kind of flat\nThat's interesting I've never you know and but that that's a great combination really guys\nYeah well it it's the the reason I go for the for the the jockey is\nWhen I when our youngest in high school gets into college you want to do travelling and so the more jockeys I having more races that means the more wins all get\nSo uh I go with a lot of jockeys because come two years when they're on their second third fourth second third day of wood wherever they'll come back to me first or adults hikes in their first round 'cause they'll remember where you were there when they were trying to raise raise money and you know\nNo one no one knew their names so to speak\nWhich brings us to another topic you guys have specialized in investing with first time leads\nA twenty five per se time leads out of forty six deals that's quite a resume of taking on the new investor tell us your thoughts behind that and let's keep that down to one\nAnd a half minutes before we got to go to break so go ahead\n\nOn one minute ... seconds so is that we're going to get we're going to mess it up this was a really important topic I don't want to mess just went up so I'm going to hold you up with\nWhat I'm asking you going to bring this back when we come back is your theory behind why'd you go with ... leads there's really a lot of reasons\nPros and cons to go one way or the other so I Want to discuss this is not a to second topic filming hold as we can go to break you want to call and ask questions our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to allow them be right back with Gregor Bethany you dig ... radio\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nYou're listening to the radio you know we'll be back with

kids\nFive of them there and the oil business with us\nDavid Was be to his own drum he's almost just like me which means we but it is all the bike growing up [noise] so um\nI remember one is a junior and he was like you you know you're controlling me you don't give me any freedom and I said here's what freedom is you pay the rent you pay the car payment you pay your own insurance and you will be free and Eighteen months and I can't wait and I saw his eyes get as big as saucers we never had any more problems\nSo David went and he got an engineering degree\nAnd so his brother's really leaning on him to come back to us we needed help really bad but he decided he's going to be a musician and he said I just don't want to look back and wonder what I could have done\nSo he gave himself two years and that was about ten years now one of his songs just won an award for a song of the year and Christian music called I Want to go back\nAcross the ocean\nWas me I had no\n\n\nDavid is in Nashville and he's he's the only one that's not with us and he had really not into mid line for about nine months\nBut he had a an event\nThat he was booked for so he was in town\nAnd he had a song on the radio at that time was first song to play on the radio\nAnd it's a song about perspective\nAnd here's where the song came from\nIt came from our family all being at Disneyland our family likes to take the trips together we discovered that if we'll pay everybody come so [laughter]\nWe were at Disneyland or Disney World\nLeast kids at the time\nFor about foreign to think Brady an addict\nSo Eddie was pushing the empty stroller and bright he wanted to push that she wrote an ad he wouldn't let him\nAnd so bright he just had a complete meltdown\nThere was a lot of laughing about that here we are Disneyland the happiest place on\nEarth got all these rides around you and here's this kid melting down because I Can't push a stroke or something you can do anywhere on earth\nDay but in particular thought\nYou know we can't do that as much\nWhere where in Disneyland really amazing opportunities we have in life and were melting down because of the bumper sticker on the car in front of us that we kinda do this to ourselves so if we can lift your eyes and see it in a different light you'll realize everything's beautiful that's the core of the salt so he came to town\nAnd Mariah and particularly really loved the song\nAnd she couldn't speak well enough to sing the whole thing but\nThe course goes something like that [noise]\nThat's how it goes so she would say a lie sky she would just do that one tag word on and [noise] and she called him uncle days because she couldn't Dave Dave so today's\nSo every time the song came on the radio she wouldn't uncle day Asian she would sing along to ethical day was big favorite then of course he's the only out of town uncle such big five so he came to town so we went over to Becky ... cats\nIt's the only out of town uncle says you pick five so he came to town so we went over to Becky ... cat and was at her sister's house with ...\nAnd may Catherine was holding arrive and David said Hi Mariah ride was just not feeling a lot of the day she was had a really like right fever and so she just didn't feel too good so we said okay well you know she will go let her take a nap and\nGot to have and we had a new office building at the time and I took him to come on a tour of the office and I got a call from Terry\n[noise] that was a you know you gotta come home right now [noise]\nRise not responsive so we flipped around and went home on our lives that the ambulance we get asked was more I go on to the hospital\nAnd Terry had been outside going for a walk and America was kind of keep an eye on Iraq because these\nFever and do seizures so she went and looked and ... and so she screamed\nJust gotten back she went in immediately did CPR they called up the empties over there and five minutes to really [noise] that caught it and plenty of time they got her color back [noise]\nWe learned later that about Ninety percent of the time with the little kids that can't start their hearts and that was that they just couldn't restarted heart\nSo she's in an app\nShe was perfectly fine [noise]\nShe just died\nSo [noise] you know we all are and you know you have this image tragedy I knew that\nWhen couples lose kids that the divorce rate's pretty high so I immediately called our pastor and said hey we need help\nBecause I don't want to see our family breakup are seeing people you know families within our family breakup\nHe said well we're just bringing in this program called grief share which I recommend it helped our family mentally but here's the bottom line [noise]\nIf you grieve together\nAnd you understand the way other people want to grave and you agree with them the way they want a grave\nYou hurt more faster\nThe event will bring you together [noise]\nBut the human tendency is to not want to have pain [noise] so when the pain comes and it's your day degrees but not the other person's day\nWhat tends to happen as the other person will withdraw because they don't want to feel the pain that day so you get a little further apart and then tomorrow it's their degree and you're okay that day so you withdraw\nAnd people just drift apart\nBecause they wouldn't grief together\nAnd this is the way I personalized I'm an oil and gas investor to understand investment\nIf you invest in other people's pain\nAnd agreed with them the way they want a grave\nYou're investing and what's left\nWhich is the Russian ship you still have [noise]\nSo what that looked like for me as\nFor for months after I every time I saw somebody they wanted to talk about ... ... and they wanted to agree with me you know ... it's a great for them to\nNow from my standpoint I didn't really want to grieve anymore you know I grieved enough but you know why because of that perspective that my past I was able to say I want a grave with this person\nBecause I'm investing in this relationship this is what remains [noise]\nAnd when we can tune you more of a story of Tim done [noise] Mariah thanks so much
