on your financial freedom today I've got four different topics on the cover a so hopefully I can get each topic covered during a segment or not go along but if we don't I just don't get to them for the first topic\nWas brought about by me doing a reading this morning and I like to read other people's self help stuff and see what they come up with and see if that makes sense to me I was reading an article by a guy and actually it was a video\nUm that was sent to me as an advertisement and the guy was supposedly an expert at goal setting okay and I say supposedly because\nFirst of all the guy looked like a gigantic fat human being with fuzzy beard he didn't look professional all he didn't look like he could be what he was claiming to be said he was a personal coach any business coach\nAnd you know he had this been about goal setting now as I get into this and I don't want you to get up in the fact that the call and this guy a really disgusting looking human being that's that really the point the point I make it is it this guy is so successful why would he not be successful enough\nTo lose weight and get in shape and looked like a professional you know business person\nSo you just got to look at people and see what what what are they doing what how much of what they're talking about is just BS right\nHow much is real how much is crap and so I said I was going to listen to guide stuff I Want to see what he had to say maybe I was wrong or about the guy in first impression you know whatever but remember this I was two hundred pounds in fourth grade I been fat\nJust like a black person could call black person black Batman could call now the fat man fat and that is not an insult or discrimination any way shape or form what it is is hey Ben that and I figured out how to fix it\nHe just hasn't or doesn't want to want to do now moving on to the material because the material is quite interesting he says in his goal setting peace and it was just a small piece he said don't start with ... realistic goals do not start with and realistic goals\nAnd don't set to many goals\nWell you can see what he means by too many goals he's got one goal get outta video to try to sell some product but no goal or getting in shape no goal on shipping off the bearded looking like a nice clean cut all American business person that would actually attract someone to want to help

American one person and he\nWalked back to do on the radio show in the first segment we are talking\nAbout goal setting in about a a video that I watch today or by some guy that just doesn't look like he's what he thinks he is a which is a personal business coach because he saying things like uh don't set a realistic goals don't set to many goals less is more\nFocus important at all he's talking about it say how do I get across town from my my job today I mean this is unrealistic is what it was all about\nYou had been given a set realistic goals from your childhood don't do this don't do that do play in the street and get hit by a car all this messaging you got and your entire life leads to a life of quiet desperation think about the lives that we were told during her entire life don't play in the street\nSo you tell your kids don't play in the street what are you done\nYou've taken away their ability to get anywhere because now they're afraid of the street when the truth of the matter is you walk out on the street you can play it at all you want as long as you looked you left to look to write because cars only come from two directions and you watch for big noisy things coming at you then you can play in the street all you want\nWell the same thing is to take your money and put four one K. and put it I re because it's safe and you but what you've done as you've taken away the vehicle you've taken away the vehicle to get to where you want to be in life to be wealthy successful financially you can't put your money to for would gain an IRA so you've been told your whole life to do these moderately\nEasy things so you go through life you go through college because if you don't have a college degree can't good a good job so then you go and you get a good job now you're working and and you're saving ten percent of what you are under five percent of what you earn whatever now you go out there and you find yourself a spouse\nAnd you get married and now you have to go out there by yourself house this expected abusive now go and spend your money on the house\nAnd the car now your card house broke and then you get yourself a baby and then you get two babies and three babies now you have baby broke and then you raise in these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and you suffer and you have a miserable life you come home and\nAfter the boss gave you crap all day long you come home and the kids give you a crap and your wife gives you ... you got to do all the stuff you don't want to do and you're tired and you're busy worn out but you can't do any of it and you know your kids loved you until they get to be about fourteen after that\nThe older they get the dumber you get and so you have all these things going on your life to make your life miserable but every day you got to get up in the morning go drive for an hour to get to work and then work all day long drive for an hour back\nAnd all this time your money's already know money you're developing no savings you're not getting any closer to being retired and you realize you have to do this for the rest of your life and then it happens\nRight if you're just you're you're almost nervous breakdowns at this point what you do is you need somebody you love you 'cause nobody else's loving you and so you get yourself a dog and the dog loves you when you come home you got somebody who loves you problem is you got to pick up its Kurds in the backyard so he's ... crap everyday to now now you get more people give 'em your crap\nAnd you do this for thirty or forty or fifty years\nThen you get to the end and you go I did it\nAccomplished what I set out to accomplish I did what the plan was to do I got the kids through college they're out of college\nWe're empty nesters don't really know my wife anymore we really don't have any type of relation anymore but we'll we'll get it back will tend to look back now which she's so old that you know I don't even really want to look at it and I'm so out of shape that I really can't do anything if I did\nAnd you know we'll get back we'll try to live sixty five years or like the next five to ten years\nOf our elderly lives\nExcept for one problem we don't have enough money to do that so I'm gonna have to continue to work part time\nOr or if we do have the money to retire just barely enough and we will not be able to travel the world because we don't have enough money to travel the world we're just going to have to live frugally and go to dinner at four o'clock every day to get the seniors discount right that's like\nAnd that was well late plan that was a serious set of goals that you had for your life\nBut there are mediocre what good is it\nBut there are mediocre\nWhat good is to set goals that are mediocre this guy is so crazy so out of it\nThat he's teaching the same lies everybody else in life teachers which is less is more don't set unrealistic goals\nWow and by the way don't set more than one goal right like you shouldn't have a goal that by the time and during my entire Thirty years of working I could stay physically fit\nThat I could create and maintain great relations with my spouse that I have a great set relations with my children\nThose goals are too many you can't have them all you got to get that money that you can retire with you got to get that forty years of work under your belt\nYou got to have that big house and you become house poor you need two or three cars unique for college degrees little Billy can't even read or write and he's going to college because as the goals\nThat were set up yes my friends you have a set of goals and there will be they are realistic but boy you really want him\nJust because you can be wimpy doesn't mean you have to be wimpy or that you should be wimpy\nYes we all have the capacity to live a mediocre lived a life of quiet desperation we all have that capacity but does that mean we have to use that capacity does that mean we need to live down to society standards\nI don't think so I firmly believe that you need to shoot for the stars\nYou've got to go for something big hey I'd rather go for something big and not get their missed the stars and hit the moon than to go for something moderate that I can achieve\nYour way better off right\nSo to do that we go back to the questions you have to ask the right questions how do I retire in five years not in thirty five or forty or fifty years you have to have a timetable and it has to be an unrealistic what\nAnd that's what people do when they called the last ... I'm going to retire and five years or less\nYou have to say I want to retire making more\nTaking home more cash that I take home from my job I don't want to retire because I'm living poor no I understand that I make a hundred thousand dollars a year but I only take sixty thousand dollars a year home\nThat's all I take home that's what I live on after taxes and my four one K. contribution and everything else that comes out of my check so what am I going to do I'm going to take home sixty five thousand dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nThat water one sixty five thousand dollars worth because I Want to do better do what I did at my job I took on sixteen now wouldn't take I'm sixty bucks so I've got these financial goals but at the very same time I'm accomplishing these goals of the next five years I Want to lose twenty five pounds and I want to keep it off\nAnd I don't want to do something I don't enjoy to do it so I'm not going to doing starvation diet or joined up for what a stupid diet programs I'm going to learn to eat\nThe moderate way that I should to not only lose the weight but to maintain that while eating foods I enjoy now that's a good goal I'm going to learn to work out in a way that keeps me fit\nBut in a way that I can enjoy so I can maintain for the rest of my life I Would work in one or two date nights a week with my wife I don't care that we're so busy with our kids one night a week somebody's going to babysit those kids I'm going to go to my kids games\nI'm going to get out there and see them do these things while they're young so they'll ever know that their parents cares and I'm going to do all these goals the same time we'll take a short break be right back to the Dell one degree\n[noise] [noise]\nFour hundred thousand your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you you're thinking well the thing is making me money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you aren't earning the Monday This is something you have to understand until you earn money and get it where you can spend it you have an ... say well it's a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will it 'til the day they don't\nAnd that day they might go backwards on you\nAnd they will it 'til the day they don't and that day they might go backwards on you so you can't say well I was up to five hundred dollars and now I'm Down to three hundred thousand so but I made the Tour de ... know you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem you're not seeing it for what it really is\nYou've got to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars a person of your life savings in that house what does it or knew nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay up to Oregon what do you still have to pay the taxes you as you still have to pay the insurance she asked you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay them you know we have to spend time and money to ... to ... whatever that maintenance I guess all of that stuff\nBut you have it earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued\nAnd it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you\nIt's just the thought of paying off the house is so common\nYet so ignorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence\nOther than this and this is the one logical one and that is you got so much money cash to invest that you can make the income that you want to make with the money you have liquid\nAnd not need the money in the house but if you cannot make with the cash you have available to you enough income to retire and live the way you want then that money sitting in your house is killing you know let's talk about guys on the radio the other day he bought nine houses over four years\nAnd turn around and look back and say wow they're all good deals ... we did really well in each one of them but for years later he's got eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nEight hundred thousand sitting there let's do some math let me get up the trustee for here let's do some math just to show you\nWhat I mean Iraq he's making four dollars a month for a thousand times twelve making forty dollars a year divided by eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nHe's making six percent return to see what I mean now what did he invested in those houses he probably invested less than twenty five thousand house will say twenty grand house\nTimes nine will come up with that number to show you the difference what he thinks he's earning or what most people think they're already twenty thousand times nine\nHundred and eighty thousand dollars now take the the um four thousand times twelve forty thousand a year divided by a hundred and eighty thousand and\nHe thinks he's making twenty six point six percent return the numbers he's calculated it in the numbers he shared with us was that kind of return in the twenties high twenty returns\nHe thinks he's making twenty six percent return but in reality he's making six percent return on his family's network his network in those houses is eight hundred thousand bucks\nHe thinks it's a hundred and eighty because he's not counting all the dead equity it's just like it's not even there\nJust like you're paying for all that money is not even there\nIt's just kind of thinking guys keep or\nWhat I Want you to do first of all I Want you to figure out if you want to make any money become rich and retire early that's the first step and if you do that what do we need to do that we need to get on top of where your money's going to come from to invest\nOr do we have enough to work to start with without doing anything you just got money laying around we'll do that that\nIf not where's the next easiest place to get the money that cost us the least to go get the money and we'll take a look at those options maybe it's borrow from your four one K. maybe it's liquid at you for okay maybe it's a liquid that your IRA maybe it's refinance and cash out refinance your house\nYou got rental properties maybe refinance and political without a maybe it's time to sell them and move on to something larger like an apartment complex those are the kinds of decisions we have to make about your financial position before you even start making a move\nBecause if you start small and collect pebbles you're going to end up with a bucket full of ... and you're never going to own a rock\nIf you want to own a rock you got to figure out how to go buy a rock\nAnd that rock may mean you have to trade in all your doubles remember monopoly for green houses and then turn it over to a hotel and then three hotels yeah that is monopoly that's what we're playing in life the same game\nThat name ours is called life in the short break we'll be

for his brave exploiting favored by the gods\nAudi was all these things\nBut as to the part of ancestry it was far from divine\nHere's joann ... author of la de Murphy\nAudi Murphy was born on June twentieth Nineteen twenty five and he was born in a little town called Kingston, Texas his parents were sharecroppers and um that means that they picked cotton\nIn fields but they didn't own the fields of fields were owned by someone else and in return for working all they got was a a little shack to live and and a tiny little bit of the money that they are and everything else went to the owner of the field\nThe house they lived and was no more than a little shack it had no running water no bathrooms no electricity they had twelve children altogether and as soon as the kids\nWere old enough maybe four or five years old they went to work in the cotton fields with their parents bought he later said that he just worked and that it was a fulltime job just existing in fact\nWhen Audi was born his mother Josie couldn't take time off to take care of the baby so she put them in a baby swing\nAnd took him out in the cotton fields with her father his name was and that and in it\nHe was pretty lazy more interested in in gambling and having a good time and the only time they\nGot any meat to eat was is already and his brothers went out and hunted them a neighbor once lent his gun and it had eight bullets in it and he went hunting came back with four rabbits and four bullets still left in the gun that's how good a shot he was\nHere's Audie sister the dean Murphy\nFigure out a little over twenty two I don't know we're seeing this really good at\nMaking killer rabbit overrun well that's how that's how we learn things that we have to go out and kill squirrels rabbits and I guess we can say we're alive because he\nHe was my hero even land for here were dating things great lazy [noise]\nHere again is Dr Smith\nOne of the things that defines him throughout his entire life is his sense of duty to the people who are depending on him he felt his duty towards his younger siblings in a profound way\nTimes we're beginning to unfold and wood shape is destiny forever the country was in the throes of the great depression at one point things got so bad for the Murphy's that they moved into a railroad boxcar\nWhen he was Thirteen Years old father left the family and he never came back so now what he had to step up and be the man of the house and in order to do that he had to quit school\nSo he never got farther than the fifth grade\nBut the person that was hardest hit in the family was his mother Josie and in Nineteen forty one she died of pneumonia and he said early death was not unusual in the story of a share cropper family I'm particularly when the share cropper himself runs off leaving his wife to take care of their children [noise]\nAnyways the Audi was only sixteen he had younger sisters and a brother to take care of it and he couldn't take care of them because he had to work\nToday were sent to an orphanage and then everything changed\nHere's Murphy historian Michael Westen all\nThat the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor December seventh probably already Murphy and Monroe Hackney we're actually will debate at a movie theater\nMurphy and Monroe Hackney we're actually on a debate at a movie theater and after they return from the media they learn the course of the bobbing\nMe late all the young man or nobody LVN chose to\nJoin for that included already Murphy is well\nWell at that time he was only about Seventeen and a half years old plus he was playing with a baby face that immediately a recruiter recognize that he's too young or tries Marines\nThey virtually laughing about he has the engines of joining the paratroopers well that that never works out so finally he is I'm just simply run off in essence he doesn't enjoy\nThough Audi during her in the fall starting to get to get that show he was a year older than he was so after he turned Eighteen and it said on his birth certificate have actually only Seventeen he went back and joined the army and he was accepted into the infantry\nAnd one of the story so far\nI've been a fan
