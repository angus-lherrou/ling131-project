after me and my family um that is the intolerant and left\nThey will come after you with everything they have a and and and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore what later to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying every day every day it was something else\nWell he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rate so then he was he was involved and gang rape fit in game right me but he was playing the parties the gang raped me well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college and I think the game right people in college or a sexually assaulted me didn't sexual assaults me but he might have been the room with other sexually assaulted me\nFor ... for somebody like for driving while he was the perfect drama I mean there's the front of the American ... person I've ever I'll bet on a high school or college in Ireland\nI I don't think he would say I think he was probably a jock\nWho was the captain of teams who drink and party with his friends and that doesn't mean that you're a rapist yeah\nYou know and and and today it was interesting 'cause on the view today they were having a conversation about this you want to talk about mob mentality or and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality Abby Huntsman\nUh was defending Maloney as me to comment saying call for evidence and and the view show exploded around her\nMaloney Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know and this exclusive interview with ABC News that she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have really hard evidence\nThat if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said to me it goes too far and away they portrayed some stories it's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia\nWell you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny Huston took a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady is telling women everywhere your word is not enough um that's that's not true I mean it's\nI Can't support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to\nA level of accountability that our court system says is a is adequate and correct that you must have evidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid his parents are now suing a five and high school students who uh falsely accused their son\nOf sexually assaulting them\nDestroyed his live destroyed his friendships destroyed his entire life they everybody's walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\nThere are people you know there was a star football player recently there was a ... a film I think it was on HBO down about him he went went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of raping a girl and it came out that they finally that he didn't labor\n\nWe should believing the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob guilt but the mob mentality of the left is good for you or a woman you must be believe no matter what and the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he proves his innocence if that's not a mob mentality I don't know what is\n\nYou can go out there and and accuse somebody of doing I mean Abby Huntsman said today evidence should always matter\nHabit and should always matter I had no problem\nWith saying to Mrs Ford I had a problem with her story when that didn't add up\nTake emotion out of it\nThe reason why I didn't believe Mrs Ford is because she got to hand pick the people that were in the house in the room and people said the president was mocking Mrs forwarded that campaign rally when you know she said you know Brett Kavanaugh you know try to ... murder me and raped me remember that\nWhat you were to happen I don't know where to happen I don't know how did you get there I Can't remember how did you leave I don't know you tell anybody know\n\nMillennia Trump said exactly what ever and this is where I Believe the midterms are going to backfire on the Democrats I Do I really do believe this there are too many mothers out there that have\nSons that have husbands that have nephews that have dads and they saw what they did the Brett Kavanaugh based on a political assault and nothing else and the assault is still doing\n\nThe salt is still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put us in charge of the houses or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nNot based on facts based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else to run on so let's turn every Republican into a racist or sexist sexual assault individual\nTurn them into a gang rape is that's what you gotta do to turn them into that\nTurn them into that\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven when they go to Steve things for wedding you're on the market then show Ben ... filling in and I go ahead\nBen thanks for taking my call you're on a great job to the steely eyed mismanaged today thank you [laughter]\nI'm a ... you know it just kills me I'm a you know when the ... well what they said the economy was basically what the gentleman said was you know he doesn't understand the histories he's um learn it or whatever they think the comment was that our call\nI'll ... I'll happily play it for you because it's this is what happens when a black person gets off the Democratic plantation was his what happens when they grow they'll read\nOkay well here's some don't rent for him you know and then when the demon crap party as I call them is the party of slavery they are John Wilkes booth was a Democrat\nIs the party of slavery they uh John Wilkes booth was a Democrat and took out Lincoln who they take is their number one hero\nOr they were the party of the KKK and Jim Crow segregation okay those are the things we're all supposed to know\nBut I learned just recently that the Democrat Party not one party member voted for the passage of the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth amendments that ended slavery so what does that tell you basically they're not the party of freedom\nAnd that's been the problem for a long long time and it's time Americans just grab their bootstraps and we do something about it because it's never going to end with these people they're the plantation owners\nAnd if somebody like Kanye leaves the plantation then all hell breaks loose pardon my French but uh you know they're the anti Freedom Party a\nWell you get your ticket you know search suicides in court as the face of the Democratic party\nShe said the electoral college is an institution that has its roots in slavery so therefore it should be abolished with the Democratic party has its roots in slavery and it certainly we already of slavery right and so shouldn't we eliminate that institution as well using her logic\nThe party still exist okay after World War two [noise] what do you think [laughter]\nI wasn't the Democrat Party abolished\nYou know why because Lincoln was assassinated had Lincoln not been assassinated saying things that I'm sure a million Americans are just you know thanking them selves right now\nWhat do you live what what if the Democrats what if the confederacy ... won the war where would we be now I don't think it's a country we'd want to live in right\nThere while the Democrats are telling you right now the country are living in as an evil country controlled by evil white rapists so you need a map of narrative yeah well the narrative as I again can you run out the economy if you're a Democrat now you can't run off the economy if if it's impossible\nYou can't run off black scaring black people that they don't have jobs if you go from there going to have jobs you can't tell them that their healthcare sexes you gave their health care that is stuck and so the only thing left to do is do character assassinations on Kanye West saying he's mentally deranged the president's taking advantage of him and this is what happened and what a negro can't read\nOr doesn't read this this this this is the new Democratic Party the party of just pure disdain and anger and frustration and at all costs character assassinations on anybody that gets in their way\nWhere ended up her over all and\nI Am six hundred

incredible I Wonder what she was really thinking by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating to what ultimately didn't make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead and edited out but anyway so I told you about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done a piece from the specter that put in context our wall of the United nations has been on their climate productions every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left\nNow I think any on it\nPolitical it's embraced by those on the left now I think any on it's a decent person you are wrong if you were ... to ... for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're going to keep on keep it on and they're going to keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies while was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age right\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another on stage\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that coin world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap well that's not working out so then it became one\nIn the eighties or nineties you'll remember what it was remember now every aerosol can every little puffs of that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone layer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere on the way are like oh you know what the sun actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually get a gate at the entire effort of this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective but taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing is sunspots you know [noise] huh [noise] so that went away and then what did it become ... global warming and we got global warming for many years Frank and then I Do\nNot buying it go from global cooling where you go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel is something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we've had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it as the pita crowds to really think about this for a moment and if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the ... or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because they got you know we have more cows what's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this\nAnyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of dinosaur flatulence and ... flatulence ended up leading to a ... extinction events the guy I'll be just you know following all the logic to its natural conclusion you say\n[noise]\nWhat's
