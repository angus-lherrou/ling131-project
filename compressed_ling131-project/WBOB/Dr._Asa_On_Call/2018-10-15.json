I mean there's little doubt he'll be president no one has one of the first round with such a margin or lost an election except for one in history when things are going to happen\nI think I think uh I think both should NATO will win in Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America has huge a written nations you know huge agricultural exports and uh and oil exports also\nShow he's saying that they'll do more of the same and the rest of the country uh let's see whether whether it you know they have the Philippines success was so you know so called success or the fear\nOf Mexico but I think they left it too late and you had too much corruption you know the problem is also you have the local police and the local governors\nAh had too much corruption now you'd have a similar political system in Brazil where it's what they call it an aura tips as much as\nThe local governors like in the U.S write the local governors have a lot of power or it's not it's not all rule from the top it's a lot of local governments are a lot of local enforcement and that didn't work in Mexico and uh let's see whether it works in Brazil\nWell I think there is a difference and you pointed out and all the experts that have studied that has said that the Mexican military was way behind it arms that were out gone and the biggest problem we had and you just nailed it is they would go in pursuit in areas and the local authorities were being paid off by the cartels so\nThey were tipping off the cartels about all of the military operations where they were where they were going to hit\nA where there are movements were and they had better weapons and they had the into being sent to them by basically despise that were part of the local law enforcement apparatus that we're all in the tank\nTo put the market in the military which is not that bad but it's not like they were topping it\nI mean the way they're rated is about in the middle of the militaries and the world I mean they're pretty well rain but it's like yeah\nAnd they have that I've got a significant amount of training and intelligence also for the U.S and\nYou don't hear about it but there's you know there has been a great deal of collaboration between the U.S and Mexico because this is a common problem\nFor both countries show you know there's ... there is you know it's very complicated in Latin America you don't want to broadcast you're working with the Yankees you know too much because then it ... it looks a little bit\nLike you can't run your own affairs and I'm doing taking orders from the Americans running reality we\nKnow that they've they've been working with the with the Mexican military and they share intelligence because of that so that they have they have done a good job but as you say that spies and the people working for the court trials I mean look sick as an entire drug cartel basically\nFounded from former special forces right so these are former military special courses that splintered off got paid more by the cartels they were the ... which is the fashions were different cartel and then they said hey we can do this on her own and establish their own cartel so\nThese guys really know what they're doing you know\nReally unbelievable it seems like ball scenario has tapped into the what you say the the desire for changing the status quo for Brazilians and it looks like people forget one of the four out of every Brazilian voter is an evangelical\nAnd um yeah I understand I think I read eighty five or Ninety percent\nOf federal lawmakers are evangelicals or this or this is a very Christian nation\nAnd I think there is any of this I I don't see all the Workers Party candidate overcome this deficit I mean that would be shocking to me when you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent I mean\nWhen you get forty six percent of your closest rival is twenty nine percent of the other people that voted for the other candidates there's at least five percent of their who just don't who had died and they're not voting for him a show like the Boston area gets his people are getting together with\nA well he had a very interesting point there because there's another changing dynamic in American politics right to the two issues across the region I mean I don't want to paint every every country will say ... but if you want to generalize there are some things you can generalize on corruption and security right\nSo those are the two issues so aside from that you get on the other important issue which is the rise of\nThe evangelical voter so a lot of these countries most of them I I in fact I I'm I'm hard pressed to think of one other than Cuba uh mainly very Catholic but now we're seeing something else which is more evangelical it's a form of Catholicism\nA but it's very much about spreading the word of God it's quite pub black\nEvangelical um you know adults being baptized and rivers and all of that\nAnd that's a new dynamic that we're seeing in Latin America you're always kind of combat\nAnd it has been in the sort of smaller local villages 'em and you'll see it and use even see it in parts of the U.S if you go into very Latino neighborhoods you'll have evangelical churches and they call themselves ... as opposed to got totally cost right so\nThey they say the Christian rather than complex\nBut it's kind of next door to consolidate his um and you are seeing that in ... in Brazil was the biggest example because it's the biggest country so it stands out the most and as I said we had a hundred and forty seven million voters on Sunday [noise]\nUm but you see across the region you also saw it in Colombia and ... and even today is a presidential rod and just you know the summer\nSo they're changing the around I care and they're viewing and that's part of what's driving this shift to the right is the rise of evangelical a practice is also driving the anti left\nEye and the and the return and very conservative values are but it's also another way of spreading the same type of a political ideology said they're getting very intertwined the politics and religion and they view themselves as being on a ...\nYou know a on a mission trip purify the political system by blocking systems they're going to becoming a force to themselves\nAnd um and it it it it's going to be interesting to watch um I'm not sure exactly how this you know how that pays out but a Latin America teachers with anything that the pendulum swings\nWell as swinging now we're going to see how this turns out when is the run off and that's what is the day on top of twenty eighth October ... October twenty and certainly so in a couple of weeks so we have no way quickly\nYeah so and every country when you have like a first time and the second round election the second round is about three weeks\nLater write checks because we want to bring it to a resolution that gives them comes at parties enough time to do a better you know a messaging and a bit of I support that so I'm not that one and to form a coalition but it you know you want it resolved quickly and so\nI think by the end of October we're going to have a boat so NATO an office and he's going to take a hard right now he's also going to take a hard line against Cuba\nAgainst swallow\nUm they they also have a problem with this migration coming across a you know and and then got refugee camps in the jungles in the Amazon jungle there um and so now does going out he's going to want to crush that problem\nUm I mean he literally that stuff's terms on which he speaks show\nUm have you know the U.S is going to have an ally on that front but he's going to need to get a lot of advice and you know maybe there's a possibility to see you to to make a friend out of hand\nIf if possible we're going we're going to the brain and see where he stands and he doesn't have a foreign policy we can do that as an opportunity\nGoing to be very interesting we're going to have you back next week the week after that to keep following this this is a fascinating election and certainly a time of change and in Brazil and as you said\nVanessa all across South America Vanessa if people want to follow you and get more information where did they go\nOh thank you so much well first of all why and an E.

I was there last night and one of the most\nSickening things I saw was last seen walks in the room like some kind of a hero and starts work in the cloud like shaking hands down the\nLine and I you know I was a couple of rows back I don't like the guy I Can't stand them I just find it to be a key like it is even his deal like just go in and sit down your the deputy attorney general I get it but I look at that\nTime and he is the epitome of what has gone wrong in the west wing White House deep state department of justice nobody trust them how is this going to play out what this guy\nAnd I don't know if you've seen the article just broke about an hour ago on Fox News and it says let me just read you the first paragraph to senior FBI officials told the bureau's top lawyer they believe deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious\nWhen he discussed secretly recording President Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year\nThis is this is exactly what the case about Rod Rosenstein is right he has\nHe has a critically overstepped his bounds as a deputy attorney general he apps I Am fully convince a man of his serious nature was not kidding when he talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment and tapping literally having people wear wires\nAnd now the former chief lawyer the top or the general counsel for the Federal Bureau of investigation said two other officials have come to him and reported the exact same thing\nI mean this guy is the deep state he is an enemy of Trump he is an enemy of the American people there has to be a repercussion he has not move forward yet on a prosecuting Jim Comey or Andy McCabe who has a criminal or Ferraro\nOr from the ... office is not done anything to to bring Lisa Page or Peter Struck into accountability\nYou know we have seen Bruce or who's still works at the department of justice\nUnder Rod Rosenstein when we know that Bruce or who was a number four person is the one who took the false ... was paid for by the Clinton campaign and brought it to the FBI he was demoted but he's still stays in an apartment so Rosenstein is the person when who signed the Pfizer application\nTo spy on American citizens on us soil\nEverything is antithetical to our constitution everything it says you can do he isn't used his power time and time and time again and I don't understand how long he gets to keep this job but just today the top FBI attorney general counsel to the FBI\nSaid that to senior officials said that he they were quote serious they believed that route and seen was quote serious\nWhen he recommended invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd wiretapping president Donald Trump I look to me you can't make this stuff up and they were too many people have cooperating information that all say the same thing about rose and saying I don't see how he stays in his job much longer\nWell obviously the president going to keep them for twenty eight days there's no question about that I think uh he figures let's just get through the next twenty eight days we've got other things to focus on but the fact that he came in the cabinet or hearing yesterday and\nWork on the line like he was some kind of a victorious bureaucrat\nOr running for office was just appalling to me I mean I don't like the guy so look I'm biased because of the things that you just said I don't trust them but one of the fears that Trump supporters have they really want you to address is that if they win the midterms\nThey really want you to address that his name when the midterms that they hang on and maybe hold the house game four or five seats in the Senate it's a big victory then\nTrump supporters are concerned that nothing will change within\nThe White House nothing will change with Trump's enemy at the same thing will go on that the only way you're going to get changes is if they lose if say when you get in there and clean house answer that question\nYou on the answer is yes and if the Republicans win or lose you know historical precedent has said that after a midterm election but there are changes in an administration whether that cabinet\nMembers whether it's staff members in the building or whether it's senior members of different departments that historically\nHas happened I think will happen again regardless of the outcome of the election that will happen but let me predict what's gonna happen in my opinion\nA if Rod Rosenstein leaves in four weeks off for months\nOr two years or whatever it is he will go out and he will do exactly what Jim Comey did exactly what Andy McCabe did exactly what all these guys do they go out and they write these books they get these massive advances and then they say about their time in the White House or their time in the department of justice and\nUh you know how they've done everything to save America from this president that's what they're going to do that's my prediction I'm certain it will happen and I am certain there are other people who were inside the administration will have certainly the administration who are going to do the same thing and this is this is the game plan now John we've seen it for two years right\nPeople go in there they serving a capacity and then they go out and they write a book look Jim ... book sold a lot of copies made Jim very very wealthy\nAnd that's what these guys want to do Andy McCabe was book comes out in early December Andy McCabe who is the deputy director of the FBI who was fired\nFor among other reasons you know running a lying to the FBI under oath on three occasions he was fired for that his book is coming up because they all profit off of Donald Trump and what sells in the book world\nIs ... stories about Donald Trump we've seen it in our fire and fury in Woodward and all the other you know tabloids that have been out there and published but my guess is ... exactly what Rod Rosenstein is going to do he will use his perch\nAs a number two person at the department of justice\nA took when he finally leads whether he's fired he quits to write a book and just you know be skating against this president because that's how these guys stay alive and this is how these guys stay a you know in the public arena and it really it's a terrible terrible thing to be honest with you\nWith the new allegations out now that\nThe Russians gene\nComments that he was going to attempt to wire get wired shape the president\nAnd then go to Jay but set him up and then go to the cabinet to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment get 'em out now you've got to have as you said to be a senior official saying they believe them and they thought he was dead serious they reported that to their\nChild to James Baker he thought it was serious McCain thought it was the origins of planets away now just to information are old that's awful I mean why doesn't the president just find this guy now\nLook I I think I think you're exactly right I think the president wants to get through this election cycle doesn't want anything to distract the Republicans have momentum on their side but I Do think you have to look long term at\nMedium six
