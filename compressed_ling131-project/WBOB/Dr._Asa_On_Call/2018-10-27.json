even people who are wealthy young people in their twenties or thirties can financially stable with they focus on saving rather than spending\nA said somebody pulling his notice attorney for financial planner base in Washington DC for people who received a raise or a bonus at work for instance shrug saving half of it or more it would get you the habit of living less living on less\nThan you make and you continue [noise] ah\nTo improve your financial situation or something like that goes on and says what are the three things you should ask yourself number one do I spend all my salary every month number to do I have six months worth of expenses in emergency savings fund\nAnd number three others were his number three oh\n\nGosh oh do I have to have retirement shame he got cut off the end of the page do I have a retirement savings\nSo if you look at what they're asking them do I spend every penny of what I make I came up with three questions you should ask yourself are you say the least twenty five to fifty percent of what you are going to do that and say you can't do that okay look I got kids living right here\nThey lived with us up until they're in their late twenties in fact one of the kids still lives with her dad and\nShe's in her late twenties you're living at home you have no bills\nRight\nYou have a job she has a job she makes good money and she sees quite a bit of it she got quite a bit of money saved up she doesn't want to admit it because she's embarrassed that none of our other friends have any money because they spend every dime they make\nWhen you were in that situation no matter where you are life you start somewhere where we have very little overhead if you don't raise your overhead that first paycheck you get a hundred percent more than what you had the day before you could start with fifty percent savings plan right that\nEasily just like the guy saying if you get a raise that raises you don't have it right now you could save half of that race\nIf you can only afford twenty five percent as you go out and buy assets and they start to increase in income that pass if it's on the outside of what you have right\nYou need none of that because you had none of it so every dime of what you earn passively should be saved so now you've got you're saving twenty five percent of your paycheck and every dime of what you make that we now have your total net worth your seven closer to fifty percent\nWith that kind of ratio and with re investments you're going to be a millionaire and no time at all second question you ask yourself is how much passive income to the last year how much more am I going to earn this year\nThe mount a passive income blows my mind when asked people okay everybody room please write down how much passive income you have and they all just looked at me like black like uh I don't know to be how do you have no passive income\nWhere in the world can Ninety five percent of the people in this country not

usually making five or six percent or less so in other words they're not out there making the hundred percent return the fifty percent return to forty percent return [noise] they're not managing their savings and retirement accounts\nThere just saving\nAnd turning very little return even though they're doing the other two things right they're saving right you know they're working the earnings are saving\nTheir not managing the returns and the returns of people are seeing when they do this test me in my class are so low it's frightening less than one percent for most people not more than five
