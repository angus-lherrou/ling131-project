Dr David Jeremiah explains why we must turn truth into action\nIn our culture here's David introducing overcoming fall so it was true\nThank you for joining us today um I don't know if you've noticed it but there's a scarcity of true these days and it doesn't seem to matter what the facts are it's a however you want to interpret them to make them say whatever you want them to say\nBut the Bible tells us that God traffics in truth and that we can learn how to overcome fall sued was truth and that's what we're going to learn about today here on the weekend edition of turning points so let's get out of\nThe day I Want to talk with you about something that set up in the air for a lot of people and that is\nTrue ... say that with me through\n\nSaturday in June the twenty fourth in Eighteen Ninety nine was a slow news day in Denver, Colorado\nFor reporters from before Denver newspapers were hanging about the Denver railroad station hoping to get side of an incoming celebrity maybe to hear some gossip they could turn into a story for the Sunday Edition of their papers\nNo such luck so they all decided to go back to the Oxford hotel and commiserate over their problem in the hotels bar\nAnd one of the reporters out Stevens had a eureka moment he said why don't we just in a story and turn it into something factual and the other reporters since the possibility but it would have to be a foreign story that couldn't be easily verify [noise]\nSo they agree a group of American engineer stopped over in Denver last night on route to China to submit a bed for tearing down the great wall\nWas made up story [noise]\nBut wait on said why would China want to tear down their most famous national monument a few ideas and theories later they all the grade they were doing it as an act of international goodwill to signify a new openness to the world and to buy new waves of foreign trade\nThe great wall would be replaced by a Fifteen hundred mile highway into the heartland of China [noise]\nIt was a great story all for reporters wrote up their version of the story and submitted it to their respective papers\nThe news story was told or the hoax masquerading as a news story was told and all four Denver papers print the story and it made its way to Europe and China and people around the world actually believe the United states was sending it on boy to dismantle the great wall that's fine [laughter]\nI mean it's amazing what can happen when people don't tell the truth and how they can actually sway nations\nWith false to it\nAnd I don't think there's any greater temptation for any of us than simply the simple lie well I mean what harm can do after all is just some words\nAnd that's where the slippery slope begins we see it all around us telephone and emails scammers cereal cheaters dishonest coworkers men who use women and vice versa bullies social media trolls even family members who take advantage of our love and our generosity\nWith other than the truth\nThis is what Jesus said of Satan he said he does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him wherever you find something that's not true\nIt came from say non truth is safe and inspired\nThe core passage that was the basis for this series of messages which is the vision chapter six the Bible tells us that were to stand having guarded our waste with the truth\nIt seems strange that the belt of the armor which is ... is the first item that Paul mentioned she says wrap yourself around with the bells of truth\nIt wasn't a piece of armor I mean a belt is not going to keep you from being wounded\nBy the bell had a central functioned was vital to the soldiers armor the soldier had all of this equipment that he wore and he had a shirt like shifted drink from his shoulders to his knees\nAnd the Roman soldier wore a metal torso armor it was long protective with leather strips that hung from his ways to his lower thighs around his whole body\nVery cumbersome but his belt was banned why fix leather with loops and slots that plant over these items and from this about there was a sword\nLots that plant over these items and from his belt there was a sword but Hong and a role in uh rations sac and money and dark everything the soldier needed in hand to hand combat was on his belt right there at his fingertips\nBut when the soldier had to run\nHe would pull his tuning up which was down around his legs and he would pull it out but he would talk it in that belt and free is legs for speed and maneuver ability and when you read about in the Bible here's what it's called dirty ones Lawrence that's what that means the means to pull your close up and talk to them in your belt\nSo you could move rapidly\nNow the belt didn't have any offensive function of its own\nThere was a piece of equipment that essentially held everything else together keeping the soldier ready for anything that he might face\nAnd here's what that means for us today in our lives ladies and gentleman true holds everything together\nTruly makes us ready at the center of our lives replaced the truth in Jesus and everything we do is drawn from at all encompassing center listen to me if we don't have the truth we don't have anything [noise]\nWithout the truth we are empty we have nothing to offer the world we have nothing to give anyone if we do not have the truth\nBut what we know the truth and we lived a true if we can assess\nOur weapons quickly and confidently and we don't have to fear anything being out of place in our lives how many of you know how much better\nAnd simpler it is to just live and the truth [noise] have you ever got yourself a limited and something that's not true and you're always looking over your shoulder to see if somebody knows what the truth is and when you don't tell the truth you have to tell another lie to cover up the lie you told and it just leaves itself around utility just developed a Jew I just love the truth is simple you know it's just tell the truth I\nAlways tell the truth\nSecond Corinthians chapter four verse to says this we have renounced the hidden things of shame not walking in crafting this nor handling the word of God the seat fully but by manifestation of the truth\nCommanding ourselves to every man's conscience in the side of God truth gives us the courage\nTo stand against our enemy\nWhy is truth to be our primary concern because the weapons of Satan are the exact opposite you know what I'm saying is weapons are here they are they're false and deception Satan wants to deceive you\nRight [noise] you say counterfeit truth is never more on display but in the way we often hear people speak of God in today's world listen to this you heard it before my God wants me to be rich\n[noise]\nBut God I Believe in and he'd\nNever send anybody to help\nOut their your God claimed to be the only one in heaven when somebody says to me my God would never do that I tell them you're absolutely right because you're God doesn't exist [noise]\nWhy [noise] we don't have a whole\nBunch of guys you know ... years ago said we're supposed to reform ourselves and the image of God but ever since he live everybody's trying to return the favor and we're trying to form God and do our own image\nWe create a little God that makes us comfortable and the way we live\nAren't many God you guys there's this one guy the guy the truth and you don't get to choose your own God you don't get to make your God to be who you want him to be if you want to live a moral lives you can't just say well my God's okay with that no he's not 'cause you don't have a God\nGod is somebody in your imagination God is who he is we don't get to change him his purpose is to change I guess we don't get a change him\n[noise] I mean\nWe live in this crazy time [noise]\nAnd unfortunately in this time there's this form of lying is used by some people to justify not telling the truth it's cold spin\nSpin is the re casting re interpretation revision of the truth to make it more palatable to the point is not to be truthful it's to reinterpret facts to take the edge off of the truth and make it more politically correct and less offensive for your own goals but in\nGod's side spin is lying\nThere isn't [laughter] you don't get to you know say okay well it was Ninety percent of the truth so it's the truth it's either a hundred percent sure where it's alive\nYou know here's what the Bible\nSays about God and ... six these six thank the lord have yes seven or an abomination to you know listen to this a proud of heart\nAllying Tom hands that shed innocent blood or heart the devices wicked plans speed that are swift to running to evil here's another of false witness who speaks lies and one who does this chord among the brother of the six things on God's sake list two of them are lying\nLet me just say it out loud the Bible says God tapes lying\nProbably for twenty two says lying lips are an abomination to the lord but those who deal truthfully\nThat is lying lives aren't abomination to the lord but those who deal truthfully are his delight\nAre words men and women as Christians that are spoken or written cannot be taken back what you tell a lie it's out there and it has its own life and even if the effects can be stopped or reversed the reputation of the liar his forever damaged\nStood of lying be overcome or has to learn how to speak the truth how do we overcome fall so it was true we start with ourselves we start speaking the truth\nWe stop coloring the truth we stop making up things that make us look better when it's not the way it is\nWe just tell the truth it's such a freeing thing to be people of truth and God has called us to speak the truth that's the first day number two [noise] we not only have to speak the truth but the Bible says we have to speak it lovingly [noise]\nYou know have you ever been around people that say well I just tell people the way it is and then they vicious you for three hours it takes you a couple of weeks to get over it [noise]\nThe Bible say we're speak the truth boldly but we're all so to speak with love\nThe Bible says work to speak the truth with grace I heard about a fourth grade teacher who was recovering from surgery and got to get well card for her class it read there Mrs Fisher your fourth grade class wishes you a speedy recovery by a vote of Fifteen to fourteen\n[noise] I don't know if that story is true or not [laughter] but that's not true love is it [noise]\nJesus said by this everybody will know that you are my disciples if you have love one for another way to speak the truth absolutely but we need to speak with low beltway Jesus model that for us Jesus was full of grace and truth\nSo that's how we should be as well so\nWe overcome fall sorted by seeking the truth and by speaking the truth and thirdly we overcome false would by living the truth\nBe overcome or has to be close to its truthfulness integrated into his or her own life listen to the words of the apostle John he said I have no greater joy band to hear that my children walk in troop\n[noise] God wants us to walk and he doesn't want us just to study the troop he didn't want us to speak the truth he wants to live in truth be true to ourselves be true to God you know every once in a while you read stories of people who lived double lives you know somebody got two wives and they're scattered all over the country delivered to lives\nHow in the world could you ever allow that to happen in your life and how could you ever survive it\nTruth is the integrating center who we are in God and were to live the truth\nYou know the lord illustrated that for us in such a perfect way listen to this one is enemies came to arrest him he said to them what's your view convicts me ups and nobody said a word\nBecause they didn't have anything\nThey could say they had nothing legitimate to convict him out because he was absolutely everything he claimed to be [noise] Jesus wanted across the center and overseeing the execution said cruelly this man was the son of God\nFunny figure that out he simply watch Jesus died as Jesus had lived he saw that Jesus was who he claimed to be exhibiting attributes that only the son of God could possess\nAnd the fool hung on the cross next to Jesus remember what he said this man has done nothing wrong why would he say that because he saw the truth exhibited in Christ even under the stress\nHorrendous circumstances men and women what's killing the impact of the church today is men and women who are in the church who are living in the face they live two lives they have their church life their religious life and then they have the life that they live in the world\nAnd the world sees that the world's not stupid the world sees the inaccuracy and the lack of integrity in our lives why would they want that they got that without Jesus they don't need Jesus for that [noise]\nSo we're going to change this whole issue of false should taking center stage instead of true we have to seek the true we have to speak the truth but most of all we have to live the truth we have to be who we are all the way through to the core\nAnd God is allowing that to happen a lot of churches that I Know about an hour starting to have some kind of revivals that are bringing that about two prayers sometimes we'd passing\nAnd I just want to urge you guys must be a part of it something good something that something was shunned the fall so that's running around trying to destroy us and let's get back to the truth you say well what do I find that true the word of God is truth\nAnd you know what the Bible says the truth will set you free\nFree\nFree for looking over\nYour shoulder to see who's following you or what\nYou said the last time it's a call to get back to the truth [noise] one of the most important moments of my spiritual\nLife was when I attended the Billy Graham funeral\nI was invited along with my wife to go to his funeral which was held in Boone North Carolina and we went and we sat him that service in a tent that was put up just for the service with the ... leaders from all over the world\nI remember sitting there and feeling very sad I mean Bill Graham hasn't done a lot for several years because he spent an invalid but just the very presence of Batman still living in our culture had given me a source of strength\nBilly Graham was a truth teller the greatest preacher of the gospel message in modern day history and he opened the door for all of us who use the power of radio and television for the purpose of preaching the true to the masses\nThe fact that he wasn't going to be or any more was so sad to me I was writing this particular message during that time Billy Graham was Ninety nine years old and for over Seventy years he had dominated evangelical landscape\nAnd when we attended ... funeral I sat there surrounded by the reality of this man's impact\nAnd then it crossed my mind the megaphone for the gospel has been silenced by death\nAnd then I thought it's true the megaphone has been silenced there will never be another Billy Graham but there are thousands of microphones still\nLeft I Can't be a megaphone but I could be a microphone\nFor the for the guy [noise] and\nCarolina I made a commitment to turn up the volume and tell the people the truth of the gospel and I challenge you to do the same the Bible says you know the truth and the truth she'll make you free speech over commerce\nHow they're going to be as do they do say you say what do you do go out and tell them about hunter the portion of the others do miss work hey man\nI Believe it was going to be due to ... to the gate there is a way that you'd be there to undergo hate that but I get other awards given them instructions late man\nI doubt even as hard as low I bet not because of Jesus came and he made that sacrifice grown men we don't have to take a man\nI tell them to go by us seven they meant the Baylor the mental health in the plane and oh what a clean\nAnd all that and you know what is just how do you do do do a bill there's ... ... ... new
