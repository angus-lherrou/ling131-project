Hurricane Center\nAt the winds were at one twenty five overnight moves up one thirty now the right one forty according to the bay county emergency medical service in the\n... even more than that and I'm not trying to be an alarmist five miles an hour gusts that ripple roof off of a building that serious\nPower people taking the storm are they still are they just are they leaving town not everybody says emergency services mark Boeing\nAbsolutely and of course we've got shelters open locally uh we've had the same issues that everybody else does with fuel and all kinds of things during this but we have got our transit system running by people who got no excuse not to get out of the storms way if they live in one of these evacuations out it was just the basic core public safety\nThat is going to be spent very quickly and we're we're having to start or you know resources that we know we're going to need\nBecause unfortunately people have not heeded this morning\nNow what you expect that later today or even here in northeast Florida and even in the Jacksonville area it's possible according to some of the news reports especially our friends that news for jacks\nDot com the Florida Panhandle is going to see surges up to Thirteen feet are higher chances of tornadoes will increase to day over parts of northern Florida which is what we're here we're tornado warnings as of yesterday also for those of you listening in Georgia also expect southern Georgia as well Michael is also to expect\nHeavy rain to be dumped in Jacksonville today tropical storm downpours and also as the storm continues to make also tropical storm warnings north of ... beach as well now maybe you want to know it yet I live in a certain county what's taking place\nIf you're in Baker county schools are closed today and tomorrow Bradford in Columbia county is also looking at that way as well\nColumbia schools will also be close Wednesday and Thursday county offices will be close so if you want for information you can usually just give us a call and we'll try to help you out a triple to talk tripled to eight\nTo five five this is a big storm that is pretty much taking place the idea of schools by the way\nFor day school week five day school week oh yeah the grades need to become much better Roger what is the best way to go we hear this we hear that school choice but according to the wall Street Journal this past week\nHas now reported by Fox News Shepard Smith that a lot of school districts have said that hey it's actually a lot of six hundred school districts are won't go into a four day school week and possibly even those in Florida can be looking at as well ours\nDo more and more schools in the United states are moving to a four day school week\nThe wall Street Journal reports they're around six hundred and schools on that schedule from around a hundred and twenty just a decade ago some school officials say that the shorter wake them save the money and improve teacher morale\nBut some parents say they're against the change for a lot of different reasons not the least of which because they need to find extra childcare\nNow I Love to hear from you teachers we have a lot of teachers listening this morning show and and it it here's a question I'd like to ask\nIf we go to a four day school week\nDoes this benefit\nIs supposed to benefit the both mhm teachers and students\nBut does it really benefit one over the other Susan leave from the Fox business news if you look at it says it might benefit the teachers more than the students but they are still looking it also is a way to save money\nCan lead to a forty school we can and I think you might not see in these rural\nSchool command and when you have to show that we have a longer day on average about thirty minutes longer but there are studies that show their parents have shorter school for better teacher township left burn more time for class crap and grade papers\nOff the higher staying in a kind of less than hire competent announcer for the cash\nStrapped school district country that whole communities and kept for patients offer for cooking to chair the ... and you talked about the bird in child care without extra\n... can I stop right there I understand the argument that people want to save money but what does the school ever say money they're always looking to increase taxes and many conservative districts here in the state of Florida out there that is so the question is is if we go down this road even here in Florida I don't hear anybody advocating\nSaving money whatsoever yeah always we never have enough money I\nWonder whether or not this entire push is to save the taxpayers money they want to give the budgets you know under control and at the same time\nOh you're push is to save the taxpayers money they want to get the budget you know under control and at the same time maybe increase teacher morale and maybe even help student morale\nOkay now what the parents were okay is is that he usually you have the parents at home family and under grandparents and burning topic of the need\nFor child care but I also limits the adoption of four days a week and beer metropolis urban center it's right to various aches and pains parents work more trouble with the kids to get into\nThat sort of that now she's talking Rogers language Rogers\nBut you don't want the kids to get in trouble but they are unsupervised and you're Seventeen Eighteen years old you know that can be problematic and some people think they're\nKinda unsupervised when they tense cool 'cause all the celebrity problems triple to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five folks are so let me throw a trifecta out there does this benefit the students do you think this actually is going to help them pass more\nIs is more beneficial to the teachers I think some would say yes because teachers do any time of great things on a friday I mean the teams are still working doesn't sound like a day off they're still getting paid or do you believe that this is really an area for the school districts to save money and by the way who is the Einstein behind all of this you know\nI don't hear school districts I mean if if ... is this something that you believe as a parent or even out of somebody who have kids in the school district do you believe that this is the right way to go do you think kids will do better uh if we have the last days per week do we have more productivity\nAnother thing I Am wondering as well as a cookie cutter one size fits all appropriate for every one maybe the four day school district so a school day works for some kids in the same district but it won't work for every kid and maybe give them the option\nYeah I mean are we over trying to adjust just remember it was year round schools and now of course you see in ... county I mean I Do my job every day sometimes late afternoon after the gym I'm like why are kids coming home at four forty five and five o'clock I'm\nThinking that's probably extracurricular stuff you know football practice et cetera I'm hoping okay that's quite possible but do they get dropped off by the parents by the buses I think there is an extra curricular bus route ... because the minute that hearing them all the way home with two of the nearest public school tripled to talk\nYeah and I think generally what you'll find with the with an independent voter if you ask them is you'll find them to be fiscally conservative and socially liberal or are you know not to the extreme of the libertarian but they consider that as independent and fair minded they don't want someone telling them\nWhat to do in their bedroom and they don't want someone taking their money\nMind signing is the senior political reporter one of the best I used to work for Fox News as their chief political correspondent out of Florida and he's getting a senior political reporter for Florida daily dot com and here's a clip CNN's John King October\nOr the dams are leading the Republicans by double digits Mike and we played a clip want your take on this in a moment here\nFor the midterm vote for weeks from today for Tuesday from today any brand new CNN poll numbers showing Democrats had a very favorable climate\nHeading in to the final stretch let's take a look at the numbers they double digit lead while we ask Americans likely voters which party will you support when you vote in your local congressional elections fifty four percent of likely voters downstate Democrats forty one percent they Republican a double digit lead for the Democrats that holds up for four weeks if that is the case on election day\nSettles guarantee the Democrats will pick up a twenty three seats they need to take back the house\nNow with my the reason why I play these is because like after you know you and I found the two thousand sixteen where they except for maybe the nationwide polls would ... Hillary leading again nationwide but many of the other polls in states like here in Florida which is dead off and that's the reason why we play these clubs in case there was another historical facts where they could be wrong again\nYou can do you I mean it's amazing because those on the conservative I like the Trump crowds don't think there's going to be as big of a blue wave the blue ... I mean the Democrats are already surpassing the Republicans here in Florida when it comes to the absentee by mail ballot out there the proof is that the floodwaters are rising here no and yet people don't want to believe in here\nMore on you as a reporter when you cover the polls how do you look at it and when people say Mike I don't buy into um how do you respond\nWell I mean first of all you got to look at the midterms elections are entirely different than presidential elections so when they say we're polling will likely voters are you pulling people that voted in the last election because I don't think that's necessarily relevant it was a presidential election\nOr your polling people that have voted consistently in mid term elections\nGives you a better response and then the the other thing that makes pulling inaccurate is if you call me up on the phone\nOr call somebody up on the phone you're likely to say something a lot different than when you're in the privacy but voting booth\nAnd that's why I don't think that the polls were accurate on President Trump because people didn't want to tell someone else over the phone necessarily that they were voting for President Trump but when they got in to the privacy but voting booth\n[noise] then you know they're not having to tell anybody that they're voting for President Trump so they're checking the box for President Trump those were two things that I Would look at it in terms of of how a whole can become inaccurate I Do believe that there is a blue wave coming how much it affects\nBelieve that there is a blue wave coming how much it affected will have I'm not really sure about but you know I've always said this\nOr add ... especially when we're talking about a ... some kind of congressional generic ballot it's ... it's important to remember the the voters psyche on this thing okay Congress polls at about ... percent approval rate and the reason why is because your congressman stinks mine is great and I'm going to reelect Ryan\n... and so you know I'd I'd just be really cautious about um you know a twelve point advantages just monstrous huge and I don't see any way that the Democrats are winning by twelve percent across the board I if you want to watch a a congressional race to say\nOkay what ... what kind of wave as they're going to be\nCongressional districts six which is St john's Flagler Lucia that's a relatively conservative district Nancy Soderberg versus Michael Walsh should give us a pretty good indication of how this thing's going to go Nancy Soderberg and when Democrats are gonna pick up a lot of seats in ...\nYeah that's the old runs fantasy Mike signing is on our news making line he is the senior political reporter\nFor Florida daily dot com you had a good article came out last week an Emmy tell you something to add a lot of the same people email me think that where it's like Waldo worries e you said that of course he you know he went after more than a Andrew Gillum track record but talk less about what he would do for governor out there um ...\nDoes he gonna kick it up or what is the mind said by the I'd just saying it's his campaign right now for weeks out ...\n... how do you pick it up first of all we're more about it'd be struck by hurricane I mean you know his his his ability to if he had said last week we're going to pick it up this week now he's got to look and say we're going to pick it up next week\nSo you know with the mindset of the Sanders campaign is look they're doing their internal polling\nThey believe they are neck and neck with Andrew Gillum but going out and doing a bunch of barbecues like Adam ... is just not the ... style of Rhonda since right so I mean for all of us expected him to be out there on the campaign trail everyday pressing the flesh with voters and kissing babies\nThat's just not the way that that that that campaign operate them we'll see whether or not it works out\nYou've got a piece coming out later this week I'm Florida daily dot com on the issue Gillum and health care what does your piece going to talk about that we may not already know\nWell it it should be out later today and it's going to be fascinating to look at how well I'm taking a look at this whole idea that he's come up with called a confederacy of states yes\nWhere he would want to do Medicare for all single payer healthcare system in coordination with other states since the federal government won't do it now that's a a concept that we haven't heard a lot of and that's the you know you want to talk about socialism that is as a just about a socialist as you can\nExplain what you mean by that\nWell basically what would happen is the state would our state New York\nCalifornia Illinois would all get together and say okay we're now going to cover every single citizen no more insurance were just covering you your cupboard\nNow as as these four huge states mega states we're going to go and negotiate with the insurance companies or negotiate with doctors and providers and and the drug companies on the prices of everything\nAnd he alleges that it's going to save money over the course of time or a ... and the short term obviously the cost would be huge and you can't do it just by yourself as the state of Florida because every sick patient and the whole nation with what the state of Florida to get their free insurance ads\nFrom the system would crash craving oh I've got to have you got to have a a a sort of a a group of large states that are doing this all of a sudden Andrew Gillum is backing off of that idea so we'll take a look at what the idea is a lie all of a sudden he's back knock on\nMy side and I love your stuff you're absolutely one of the best you make your article very simplistic do not long drawn out of the articles are very to the point um my son who was the chief political correspondent for Fox News or that it's a thirty five overland though he is a senior political reporter for Florida daily dot com Florida daily dot com I could have you on as always thank you\nOkay and just one more note that I'm a college football jump junkies so if you want to go to Florida dailies Facebook page now happy to debate the best teams in college football\nWithout twenty five I look at it by the way I was wrong and a seminal out of the seminal blowing big lead over the week and I'm just a just disastrous and then the gators win anyway\nAll of this more as we continue to move along talk radio WBFO beyond\nButler boulevard ... to actually is one of the ... and when you get to San Pablo you'll see another crash and all the ... when ... south heading into Mandarin an accident blocks two lanes\nTraffic report is run by J David tax long when you over the IRS and can go to Jay Jay with tax law downtown peace of mind is only liquor phone call away\nYou know it's a brilliant idea sharing in just makes sense to share cars to get from one place to another you could share houses when you go on vacation we teach kids to do it it's a wonderful thing so what did he met someone willing to share your health care bills\nThat's the beauty of men and share at a time when insurance costs are through the roof medicine is affordable down to earth healthcare\nFor about half the cost of insurance you get hundreds of thousands of people who share your medical extensive no tax

[noise]\nAnya or they are like polling across the United states or can they skew these numbers of pulp people like in New York\nOr in Miami or in South Texas or in like a ... a Los Angeles and San Francisco because if you look at do they call people and Oklahoma City or do they call people in Montana and talk to them because if you look at the map\nThe only place I understand this is not the general election but if you look at the map across the United states is currently read you only dominant blue is you know the far east or west and South Florida\nI think in some of that well I Want to give you a trick question back to you but let me address it in the reality ... I think they're looking at some of the swing districts or maybe Hillary one by one or Trump one by one\nAnd I think there can be combining those but what about when President Trump is up at fifty percent with rats and said do you asked at the same question you ask about whether or not the Democrats winning and the generic ballot\nUm I don't know [laughter] I really\nReally nervous I mean yeah but but but Don I think if you look at the ... did you see this on do you believe is going to be a blue wave or do you think that the Dems will pick up seats or you think this is all just a bunch of farcical up at the rocks are the Republicans will actually will maintain what do you think\nI think the Dems are going to pick up some seats but I think in the grass roots\nA Republican areas I really don't think they're going to make a big move in those areas\nInteresting All right but I kind of stuff going on yeah\nOkay um my son goes to UCS and the first week in school we took him down or to drop him off in the bay was stumping for Gillum down there really and we were walking around the campus and this lady came up and she asked my son she says are you registered to vote\nAnd he goes no she said would you like to register and he said sure and she goes well what party affiliation or you and she he goes well I think I'm going to be a Republican and she said thank you and\nTurn around and why he stopped or he stopped her I said hey I Want to register and she says well we were only told her registered Democrat ... a democratic voter\nLao I Wonder if that's even a legal I think that's against the law could be wrong maybe ... well they can make and I know they're not so well it is if they mess with the ballots afterword his paint on why does your wife did your son I mean I I went to I took some schooling will be UCF years ago\nWhy you see how it is it's a great school don't get me wrong but it is a really a haven\nFor left wing is them out there I mean you get all the anti ... death to Israel all those crowds show up it is very liberal at that college\nIt is I was I was really stunned when I walked around that school the things that I saw on the campus but ah he's a he's trying to be a double engineering major\nAt all and I and I\nAnd the teenagers that he rots we looked at you know he looked at some different schools was accepted to a lot of different schools but for the programs that he wanted that's where he want\nHer to have gone by the way if I may act like a typical male per second I Do know the college Republicans have a big college Republican crowd down there and by the way it is so successful because it's run by women\nIt is and so I'm just saying is if you need permission by that but they've got a big college Republican but you see that's a great school but that is a great story Don thanks for calling in you know before we get back to the phones to triple to talk triple to eight to five five\nOr is it illegal ... it could be um it is what you would they really looked Rogers what you do with the ballots outdoor to properly send demand registration right goofy ... thousand in twelve one of the reasons why bronco bomber was very successful for reelection here in Florida\nHis group was used to be Obama was it uh it was a corner was organizing for America they would have registered Republicans\nHey I'm a route they register them and then they would get three mailing list and then they would send me an email and don't hate thank you for registering here some information about the Democrat Party they can do that okay and that's the reason why they're just you know they don't know any better than registering voters do you do bomb a crowd down to register didn't matter if they're gonna watch the Republican they still game Obama information\nIt's about getting out the vote yeah\nTriple to talk triple do eight to five five Rick good morning you're on WB obey\nGood morning ed I'm I have registered a lot of voters and the law changed a couple of years because it is actually what you just said um if someone solicit your vote they have no choice but to register you correct correct\nAnd and the other thing is\nIt is against the law for them to take your former and I'm from you after you filled it out unless it has a sick Quinn show number in the corner where it is tracked by the supervisor of elections\nAnd that is usually not dark at my church we register voters we take the form and we give it to the person that had already we included stamp address Tom below so they fill it out and put it in the mail we never touch it\nHold on wait stop there for a second just just for clarification for the audience you register people at your church how do you do that\nWe have a I'm a I'm registration drive\nIs it
