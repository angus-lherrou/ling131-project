Haitian\nThing or the only country aid for need and how they're getting their point a week for why not good enough\nFor you here's what I'm surprised by ... or not surprised that I should say\nThe latest Quinnipiac poll now put forty percent of Americans who are opposed to this confirmation fifty five percent for one them by the way\nBecause looking at that she's looking at some in terms of ... political move for him to just the fast track this thing came out at the at\nThe end of the nation is gone what is your action by answer that question I I think than this and we'll have to assess on the basis of his record and and I mean I think I think that there are enough people who have very serious concerns about how extreme this nominee and uh so far outside of the mainstream in a very dangerous judicial philosophy as well as very legitimate concerns about his independence\nAnd so they're all over the map right there Roger Anderson a first off they want a fast track this I Hope everybody realize this was the first week that the U.S Supreme Court has hearings which means ounce of four to four which means ... just get kicked back to the states depending on what side you argue may like that\nNow it's about the sexual allegations now we just find out again hey well he's really too extreme ... which one would you\nStay on the issue is what ... do you want to\nBe a you know I was looking a channel surfer yesterday landed on HBO which I normally don't watch I get it for free because we're bundling thing and even Bill Maher who is a liberal acknowledge that the real reason that he's going through all this is because of the abortion debate roe versus Wade that's what it's coming down to it\nBut then again Republicans are saying wait a second I mean is it really are really not a conspiracy the Dianne Feinstein and other Democrats held on to this letter by Christine Ford again Democrats council Dave brown says there's no conspiracy here that's made up by the Republicans\nAnd were and still are very dismayed by the profound political cynicism of the Republican majority in the Senate fashion I Do think that's a very legitimate concern I Would also say by the way that this is this is a phenomenal conspiracy that's been laid out but let's keep in mind\nThat professor Ford\nAnd offered up her concerns and a letter before Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court so they are not that was hidden to suppose that this is some kind of premeditated conspiracy on her power and it should laugh\nThen then why do they hold a letter for so many weeks\nI get the argument that maybe you know leaves Feinstein may have been part of a conspiracy but I don't think uh maybe Christine Ford was because she came forward prior to\nKnow I think they're more talking about not so much it forty yes but the argument of course there's going to be on as you point out die and find St President Trump was on the well the Trump stump Republicans\nAre willing to do anything to anyone to get their way like they're doing\nWith the judge Kavanaugh [noise]\nTo get their way like they're doing\nWith the judge Kavanaugh\n[noise]\nAnd then they go with the FBI or they should say by the way we took ten years didn't want more time [noise] but they want to take\nSo here's more from the story is just reported that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the quote the time for and this delay instruction has come to a close they expect to have a vote considering this week the American bar association even though that they've called for an investigation they originally by the way the a BA very liberal American Bar association\nRepublicans and you're hoping that the centerpiece of the ... campaign because by the raw data the economy is doing great\nChallenge for\nRepublican Party right now is that even the economy's doing well translating support for the president Herbert Hoover for the economy how well the economy's getting or how poor they economies telling them much more important\nIn a presidential election then in mid term elections kind of means elected president\nPresident for like a Congress now\nShe brings in a very valid point or the economy was doing well in two thousand six remember even among Bush even though we had that almost on another Great Depression great recession that the economy for very well because of the tax cuts\nA President Bush some of that we haven't seen in years except now for Trump by me beforehand of course Clinton and that of Ronald Reagan but then again\nWhen you look at it the Democrats won in two thousand six to house the Senate yeah All right even\nThough Bush won reelection to the White House\nRight and then when the economy slightly came back the first two years of Bill Clinton the Republicans took over that and you know um but then again when you look at the election season every election season as well the economy has been a top cherish\nThe economy is going along with very very well right now my my biggest concern in question that I've got is whether or not the capital controversy is going to draw people to the polls on both sides this election season\nI think the economy is the best issue that Republicans are running on the base is so happy for the economy they want to hear more of a cultural\nIssue and I think the culture is uses also taught as your issue but that's a good question where nothing to the cabinet some pollsters say yes others say no Lindsey Graham's out there telling people hey if he fails re nominated them again and make them a big issue in the red states yeah that could happen by the way speaking about that Brett Baer\n... the host of special report\nIt talks about as of right now what is the outlook between the Republicans and Democrats coming up in the U.S Senate\nAs of now we go by the average of the polls in each of these tossup races here's what it means as of now Arizona goes to the Democrats straight here goes to the Republicans\nYou hear that as of right now Florida goes to the Republicans what about the rest of the some of these other red state\nDemocrats pick a Tennessee Republicans pick up the Missouri we mentioned North Dakota changes Nevada state in the same all at least they stay the same and then there's a lot of time a lot of issues can change these tight races but it's a net pick up four Republicans one scene\nThe economy is just one of these issues a lot of races\nNow you heard what he said some of the red states according to Fox News again this was a month out they've got\nThey've got Bill Nelson losing a Rick Scott but they've got Marsha Blackburn in a heavily from state run against the former governor Phil Bredesen they call that that's a pickup for the Democrats and interest so they're saying you know normally it was predicted maybe three to four Senate seats\nNow they're only talking about the possibility of maybe the ones that are ... wants to add to what am I saying oh one seat increase\nSo that's also coming around out there tripled to talk triple to eight to\nFive five six and calls let's go to a Kurt hey Kurt good morning run W. B. O. B.\nMorning it I think I have a simple solution to the whole investigation that the Democrats won All right give them everything that they won't let the investigation go on as long as possible but postponed the electric [laughter]\nThat's right that's the best ... lawyer in a dream world that would be excellent would've not because that means probably below voter turnout that's a great one\nWithout any I just thought I'd throw that\nI Am glad you did they call it and it's more I like that just postponed the election tripled to talk cold I got to write that one that I Want to use our myself hold on to host Conan the election and that was a great I Want to put that one on Facebook know sticking with good morning you're on WB you'll be how's it going\nGood a good I wouldn't give too much attention to those false we're forgetting about the Trump affect their member goes to subsidies looney\nDirt because his party Ocasio and found there's there when it come painting for to solve this where it started the latest and when Sean when after those guys lost that St piano sorry\nAnd when when after those guys lost that same feeling sorry the member this emptiness he was behind on the walls\nNo no no the only one of the rest of the polls show dissent is up by nine to Seventeen points\nOkay but he was behind or dollars and one of your other guy right when Trump came to town you went up all the well the same thing happened to me so I don't think too much attention as soon as Strunk showed up from a job that's going to change\nAll right let me ask you do you believe holding me ask you a question do you believe there will be a blue wave or do you think he's going to pick up seats do you think the Democrats pick up seats based on the history or do you think is going to be a blue wave\nNo I Believe that's a rich so now me coming in November oh please set up I'm sick and tired of all the Democrats lies even rent out there on my family they hard hard Democrats and they told

you'll forgive you eventually\nDean former Democrat council Dave brown says that maybe he kind of said something they shouldn't have said that the real reason why the cabinet have all these things is because of his extreme\nViews but I'm not persuaded now we're going to make it I'm not persuaded Mitch McConnell sincerely wants to conduct an investigation\nThing why is he ... or the only country aid for need and how they're getting their point a week for why not good enough\nFor you here's what I'm surprised by ... or not surprised that I should say\nThe latest Quinnipiac poll now put forty percent of Americans who are opposed to this confirmation fifty five percent for one them by the way\nAnd it's because we're looking at this he's looking at them in terms of the bowling political move for him to just the fast track this thing just pointing out that\nYou understand why they're fast tracking this I mean they're not ... to be honest with you it's because the U.S Supreme Court has met this week it's now a four to four that's the reason why they want to put on a copper me do you like you know not\nAt the at the end in ... what is your reaction\nBy answer that question I think Dennis and then we'll have to assess on the basis of this right here and and I mean I think I think that there are enough people who have very serious concerns about how extreme this nominee is Eric how so far outside of the mainstream and a very dangerous judicial philosophy as well as very legitimate concerns about his independence and the temperament absolutely\nYou know let's ask this question Roger let's let's put away\nA starting with Clinton the Arab personal destruction I Want to call it let's put away sex with an intern whatnot he obstruct adjusted for put all the way the personal things\nIt should be about the issues as well we were told by the Democrats over the last twenty you actually Twenty years ago twenty hour around this time Twenty years ago was one we had all this impeachment stuff going on\nWe have Republicans out there putting out accusations here in Florida about\nCandidates on the left instead of their issues it's more about the driving record about what is not they got suspended or not right if this was all about the issues in let's say to the Democrat is exactly correct we think judge Kavanaugh to extreme well here's my question didn't why not focus on that whether or not he got drunk at a bar it through I said somebody back in Nineteen eighty five\nBecause I don't believe they think it's going to stop him from getting confirmed and I think they probably think their best bet as as far as being able to haul used as confirmation used to go after these really little ball things\nAmerican Bar association says even though that they back and investigation they still continue to endorse Brett Kavanaugh by the way you do know that the ADA the American bar association is not that conservative out there but now allegations against Kavanaugh shift as Democrats and reporters yes many times they are one of the same seek\nTo what may stick according to the national review if you notice after last Thursday the hearings went from ... did he commits sexual assault to a raging debate whether he lied about slaying that he might have used in high school yearbook\nCollege drinking or inside jokes and get as you just heard a clip a few moments ago about whether or not he was too angry to be a Supreme Court judge now even in New York Times reporter who was openly opposed cabin all wrote that he might have been in a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five but he might have actually thrown ice at someone in that bar again dates\nIt was just minor did let me ask you a question then why should cabin I'll be thrown away based on whether or not he got blacked out from being drunk Thirty years ago right tripled to talk tripled to\nTo five five ride good morning you're on WB obey\nThe latest case\nWhich lady\nShe she's a stone that can

Ruth Bader Ginsburg says hey I plan to be able to provide more years well let's see her health doesn't work that\nLet's say hypothetically two years she's gone let's say Trump wins reelection hypothetically let's say he runs again okay and he gets confirmed\nThe Dems are going to listen we thought we didn't think this was going to be a problem we're all going to be the next one writer gates works do justice prior exactly it and yet this is what I'm getting at if they're able to derail cabinet all\nThis time or I think the Dems are pumped to get to the polls because this way they want to ensure that Bill Nelson gets re elected\nIn that they're able to pick ups keep some of these red state Democrats there this week Trump cannot get a conservative all the court's remember the Democrats have only been able to allow to push further their their ... their agenda hasn't been through a legislative process but through the courts\nRight and ... and one very concerning thing for those on the right at least one poll is saying now the majority of those who have an opinion I think the Kevin should not go to the courts now\nYeah so there you go if you buy those polls threat let's go to to Jerome Jerome good morning read W. B. O. B.

read into our\nMemory was one hundred and point out the new arena is one hundred point on so we lost seven cents but trust me\nAnything over a hundred is very very very solid just think about it this way the highest number in the last Twenty years which my database actually Twenty one years is one of three point eight that's from for this year we had one at one point four in March\nThat was the highest level going to that January of oh for a hundred\nPoint on is the second best number of the year\nAnd a lot of numbers in other words if it's over a hundred it's doing quite well that's what he's saying what about inflation is inflation in check\nOff the number now let's go to any turtles real fast if you look at the one year inflation outlook it move down at ten from two point eight to two points of it\nSo inflation is in jak remember this was all supposed to be a disaster President Trump became a guy or she is the candidate Trump got elected the president was about a month out

to the polls next month to Fox News poll voters said that the economy and health care will be the most important to their vote for Congress has followed closely by party control of the house and support for President Trump's immigration and guns round out the top five\nWere you surprised against those top five issue I Am it has it has to go to school shooting in a while you know obviously they're tragedy which I happened to that usually takes up but gun control debate and argument on both sides\nBe competed which has really been disguised if that many of you to listen to the show don't think there's going to be a blue wave the Rick ... he's doing well consumer confidence is high retail sales that are all time high that we've seen in twenty five years I mean everything is just going well for the economy there but\nFrom the cook Political Report any ... yeah the economy's doing well but if it's going to benefit anybody normally those that are running in a presidential election season here\nRepublicans and you're hoping that this is the centerpiece of the ... campaign because by the raw data the economy is doing great\nChallenge for Republican Party right now is that even though the economy's doing well translating support for the president of the economy and how well the economy thing or how poorly the economy's doing much more important\nPresidential election then in mid term elections kind of means elected president\nPresident elect to Congress\nBut yet you'd think that it's going to benefit people's back pocket more take home pay you think that still this is just not hurt the I'm happy as bad as Trump is some would say\nTweeting and things and the economy's doing well underneath them but does this translate until we keep asking us with the economy does this soften the blow by a blue wave from a Democrat but it'll be a lot of people\nWith the economy does this soften the blow by a blue wave from a Democrat\nI think it'll be a lot of people going to the polls that goes with the capital of controversy on both sides correct It's going to come up to turn out who gets there are people out the most you would think that people won't vote against their back pocket but maybe they will\nThe economy that issue that Republicans are running on the base so happy for the economy they want to hear more of a cultural issue\nOne of the biggest things of this year's elections and whether or not but Dems will take the house is about whether Republicans may picked up some of those red state Democrats into Republican hands with about a month left with the

but whether or not he'll make it this week Mitch McConnell says there will be a vote one way or the other even during the FBI investigation with the latest on that Fox News' Mike Emanuel\nWell placed Republicans ... says the FBI may not need this entire week to investigate the allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh could wrap things up as soon as tomorrow new Senate majority leader predicts

investigation into the FBI she interviewed twenty three people\nMiss the witnesses is only the beginning\nAnd what I Need\nTo use the main and now some Democrats say beyond the allegations his fiery defensive Thursday's hearing alone should disqualify us now\nWe're going to get to that moment you do see where all this was going now\nHe should be accused of something that happened thirty six years ago now it's about his temperament because they don't like him going he didn't they didn't like Brett Kavanaugh questioning the U.S senators last week for questioning him and now it's about whether or not the FBI now that was Richard Blumenthal by the way Democrat from Connecticut\nWho says now we need to have it's no longer three or four or five we have twenty three witnesses oh you know what's gonna happen next now we've got fifty three witnesses Mollie Hemingway senior editor from the federal says there's FBI investigation should not take long since when you look at the track record of the FBI with some of these court cases investigations\nThey pretty much wrap it up at about a couple of days yeah well\nFirst of all last week Democrats during the hearing said that they would like an FBI investigation and they have gotten that FBI investigation and as soon as they got it then we started hearing\nThat they had more and more things that they needed the specific facts of the history and doing things like that that kind of know how to do investigations like this when you think about the ... when her laptop that had all the Hillary Clinton now for took care of that and get to a few days\nWhen you need a hill had her allegations against Clarence Thomas that also tend to have\nReason any more than we now call the witnesses are we know what they have to say but\nYet the Democrats say that this argument for the Republicans about delayed delayed delayed just isn't true New York senator Democrat Chuck Schumer\nDemocrats are not interested in the way for the sake of delay\nThis can all be completed quickly [noise]\nBut it must be done right\nNow it must be done right and that means the investigation of a week is not going to be long enough but now there's a new argument of the reason why that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court is because he hurt the feelings of the Democrats last week\nCabin or harbors dean dean partisan for that\nThat's not the kind of justice we need on the Supreme Court\nBut most could you could you not say that ... that's the kind of individual we don't want us to a U.S senator you you and I both elaborate about him under the boss or you know why would you be a little resentful right now I think he's going to get over it in time but you know right now those moons or fresh to listen to what the Democrats are saying that I mean they're all over the map but it's a construction project there's\nTen Fifteen twenty different reasons why that Cabot all should not be confirmed former Democrat council Dave brown Fox News at night which Shannon brain I'm\nNot persuaded I'm not going to make it I'm not persuaded Mitch McConnell sincerely wants the FBI that conduct an investigation thing why is he ...\nBank or the only country aid for need and how they're getting this one a week for why not good enough\nYou here's what I'm surprised by ... or not surprised that I should say\nThe latest Quinnipiac poll now puts forty percent of Americans who are opposed to this confirmation fifty five percent for one them by the way\nIt's because we're looking at that she was looking at the midterms is is a barley political move for him to just [noise]\nLooking at this he's looking at the midterms is is the only political move for him it's just the fast track this thing came out and said\nWait a second but before we get into where they really again showing their hand about ... extremism you heard what he said about they're trying to fast track this\nFolks it went through a normal process it's the Democrats that are making this on a normal by releasing the last minute our about this letter of what it's supposedly came out\nBut you do know that this week Roger is the beginning of the two thousand eighty two thousand Nineteen Supreme Court session is a four to four vote hence you call it fast track we call this normality because it's supposed to be nine or the Supreme Court not eight at the at\nThe end of the nation and done what is your action by answer that question I I think than this and we'll have to assess on the basis of Israel and and I mean I think I think that there are enough people who have very serious concerns about how extreme this nominee is how so far outside of the mainstream minute as well as very legitimate concerns about his independence and his temperament\nDon't get to didn't want to just sit on the issue than Roger why why not just about whether or not you think that this guy's a boat or excuse me a his uh dissents are wrong or as confirmation about a law that might've been challenged you agree with it was on the left or right why do we just based on the issue I\nDon't believe that they will do that because it's not enough to get people fired up to stop him from being confirmed because it's ultimately I Believe their goal\nMore as we continue the move along by the way let me play one more quick for you again this was on Fox News at night with Shannon brain former Democratic council day brown says there is no kids parents see out there by Christine Ford or the left\nAnd where and still are very dismayed by the profound political cynicism of the Republican majority in the Senate fashion I Do think that's a very legitimate concern I Would also say by the way that this is this is a phenomenal conspiracy that's been laid out but let's keep in mind\nThat professor Ford\nAnd offered up her concerns and a letter for\nFolks listening to this one more time\nCame forward and offered up her concerns and a letter before Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court Christine\nFord released this letter wrote a letter whatever before he was even hold on I just want make sure I got this right now\nFor Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court\nBefore he was even nominated to the Supreme Court when did she write the letter that's what I'm curious can we find out what it was David if it was done before why wasn't done before he became or during the appeals court process one out that as well\nI mean the ... listen Brock Obama was very positive you know he went on that\nAnd I was able to talk to the president want to thank him for his support I Want to thank him for interesting me with viewing me if somebody who can be a great leader for Florida says thank you Mr President many\nPeople believe of course once the debates take place that will pretty much change things around when it comes to the rates are\nVery rare that say let's say a girl\nWho is our candidate ... let's see probably a little bit too progressive for him but he's got a lot of ... ... voters seed orders and he's running against the Tea Party Republican so we have a chance to all\nRight so I'm evidently ... that's ... former DNC chair out there so I mean there are pumped the remember there are about five hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in this day remember Trump one about a hundred and twenty thousand votes\nHere and do all county only won by five thousand Martha Roby won by sixty four Dems feel pretty much pumped up here locally\nAnd not only that but a beginning campaigns getting a lot of campaign contributions coming at especially from outside of the state millions and millions of dollars are pouring it's going to be a very aggressive campaign\nAll right so let's get to some emails here a lot of people been wanting to weigh in on this and are by the way tripled to ... there were four triple to eight to five by by the way somebody do agree with me that
