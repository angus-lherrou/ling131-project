B. O. B.\nAnd here over the top stories were bringing you this morning the wall Street Journal reports that the White House and the Senate Judiciary committee have received the FBI report on Brett Kavanaugh ethics by no support of sexual misconduct\nWhile Democrats to lead over Republicans when it comes to a voter turnout enthusiasm a new poll finds that Republicans have closed in on the gas\nAnd campaign ads hitting the airwaves or going after Democrat Andrew Gillum Andrews economic proposals\nContacts and the one on one minute call to two\nTo five ... or email him and you'll be\nAll right Roger forgive me for a moment I'm going through the ... all the senators got the report well I'm going through right now because evidently you know everything leaks up in Tallahassee is not tell all Tallahassee seem of yeah so if you just ... you just give me a second here folks um yup nothing they're All right so there we go [laughter]\nYou know there's going to get you know it's really good morning three minutes after the top of the hour all the way with your nine AM and dean hair long with Roger ... and the only morning talk show was kinda anywhere here now in Jacksonville but northeast Florida this is talk radio W. B. O. B.\nSo let's get to the Senate the\nWhite House says there's nothing there\nBut of course the spin will take place from\nThe Democrats folks just gets to be very interesting because\nOnly a few ah I said well assuming more going to get to see it suppose are gonna be a rate is going to be like in a lock box the but now the question is okay the report now has been released all the other things that the aftermath whatsoever what does this mean when it comes to a vote for Brett\nKavanaugh with the latest here is Fox News' Mike Emanuel\nCopy of that at the record will come here to Capitol Hill effort goes to the White House it will be kept in a safe in the Senate Judiciary committee\nAll one hundred senators and just sign staffers will be authorized to read it and some Democrats are complaining is not going to be thorough enough has for voting thinking is here's how it could all play out\nMcConnell starting with it tonight a layover day tomorrow they free friday potentially with a a procedural vote in a final passage wrote on confirmation would take place on Saturday So if they want final confirmation by the end of the week we need to get the ball rolling soon so\nIt looks like the latest is going to be Saturday\nBefore they get on with the vote now\nWay too we break this down for you the Democrats wanted the gate and do all their spin with the FBI investigation but again this is where it gets a little bit tricky from the author of the book the Russian hoax great Jared who was a Fox News analyst is said\nThat Democrats do want really want this released unless it benefits them they actually want to keep it the old ... for their own political benefit this is what great Jarrett says\nThat I find it amazing now that very individual Dianne Feinstein who conceal information initially now is it tempting to conceal the FBI report\nShaming demanded this has been Corinne wildly out of control and the only way to slam the brakes on his imminent train wreck is to be open and honest in transparent and yet that's not what Dianne Feinstein why maybe because she wants to misrepresent\nThe contents of that report which apparently offer absolutely no corroboration and only reputation of the badly\nSo here's what's next remember you had Cory Booker we play this yesterday's radio show that says whether he's\n... you know whether he's guilty or not we need to get a new uh just just to be appointed up there and they're not they're not very like anybody folks I mean everybody thinks that this was up in pre determined by the White House but let's remind everybody that on the Senate Judiciary committee\nEverything was already pre determined they said that they're going to vote no on ... well before the confirmation hearings took place what is the next move well\nIt's about his judicial temperament Fox News channel brand talks about how Dianne Feinstein and some other Democrats are saying this is their main reason why to vote against\nKavanaugh looks kind of cat on the centers I and finds yeah I don't know about him not being interviewed by the Afghan for the background capture that when he went and yelling and demeaning senator making misleading statement the town down on his overall trustworthy and I I don't think that would happen with FBI agent seated across the table\nNow Lindsey Graham responded to that he says wait a second he had to defend himself and his family gets accusations he says you want to talk about judicial temperament where was the temperament on the Democrats' side\nAbout this just had the temping temperament and the judge is one that tends to be the most would you react if somebody destroyed ... then you found yourself in front of the entire nation being humiliated but what'd you do if you saw this man is yelling\nAnd I saw a man who was offended to score\nDependent his good name\nTook it to the people who are trying to destroy his family what would you do if you're in that situation so this idea that somehow his temperament and sing question here rewarding\nThe worst behavior I've seen in Twenty years if you buy that garbage to any Republican his temperament for this hearing was aimed plus plus according to a BA in letting these people\nWho what they've done to judge Kavanaugh and reward them\nNo something goes a little bit further more than just a political thing you hear Roger it's about women\nDonald Trump says it's a horrible time to be a young male in this country he says you can be accused of anything without any due process and let's be honest when you look at a lot of the allegations men if when there was a due process locals who the men are those in jail whatsoever actress ... says skip the due process women have been thrown under the bus\nThat's just part of the pendulum swinging\nRuining young people how difficult for generations and generations and generations we will not be firing any longer and it's happening men have a hard time right now I'm Sorry this in the way the other half the shift\nThis is the way the pendulum has the shift from the daily wire dot com venture pero says you know women accusations may be one thing but without the due process\nPlenty of kind of shocking to suggest that due process shouldn't apply to now and I mean that that is the essence of sex and the idea that certain rules should not apply to people on the basis of their genetic is that that's that obviously discrimination of the highest order but this is the world and literally now lead it was white men are presumed guilty\nI mean the discrimination of the highest order but this is the world in which we now live in which white men are presumed guilty because they're white men because they're supposedly in a position of ... like I wasn't aware that Brett Kavanaugh for him and for his presumption of innocence or due process of law simply because of the color of his skin or the nature of his genetics\nAnd a lot of that with the due process remember President Trump some say mocking making fun of Christine for the other evening at a campaign rally\nThat it shouldn't happen to him he shouldn't have them he's going through thirty six years ago this time\nI ... I Wonder\nDo you think it was I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was and I don't know\nYou know if there was a mistake and of course as a journalist\nOf course they never make mistakes as you know need to do like the officials here we've always advocate it you know we send this radio months' ago hey you know the number showed Republicans going to pick up why don't have the votes will after\nThe election the guarantee writes I sit back and get you know what I understand in fact Franklin said the same thing I'm like understanding why now just in case because again there was like a ... in a in a cabin all excuse with the cabinet of course a slight Collins and of course from ... in the Republican Smith the Republicans ... Democrats\nHaving said that we also sat back and said what good is an FBI an extra few days in the next week in a matter uh-huh and I kept asking a question wouldn't one week give political coverage to the Republicans a quarter of that poll yeah yes it does yes\nIt did you know what I think it backfired on the Democrats will be Judiciary Committee got up and he thought we would end up adding to their\nReno anticipated blue wave and it actually triggered lord looks like it's going to be a red wave and I think I I'm thinking of this point the way the way the polls are trending right now this looks like this is firing up Republicans to get to the polls because it's all about turnout and\nWriter now let me break it down just a little bit more okay Joe ... a media reporter from the hill dot com talks about for example and the first term of president B H Obama Brock H Obama and the enthusiasm among Republicans when they want to listen to this clip\nWell interest is relatively high among both parties Democrats have an eight point edge that had Republicans and just for some context and twenty pen when Democrats for sixty three seats in President Obama's first term Republican enthusiasm was at a December fall democratic enthusiasm was two percent\nFifties as a Fifteen Percent difference okay\nBack when the Republicans one and two thousand ten of the enthusiasm gap okay\nThose levers now Henry in the sixties according to a Wall Street journal\nWow Wall Street journal also both of the numbers other Republicans and Democrats are in the sixties Senate for me Roger interesting\nWhat was going to be a street fight this coming November ... usually metaphorically when it comes to getting their people to the polls this November because it's all going to be about turnout and a big turnout is expected on both sides the\nIs it the Atlantic I guess there are kind of a liberal magazine that's what's been described that they had a thing called the Atlanta festival were Hillary was speaking and Kamala Harris Lindsey Graham is they're talked about his support from Brett Kavanaugh and got booed level is the Lindsey response\nOn the first person to say I want to hear from the doctor for it\nI thought she was handled respectfully\nThough Kavanaugh was treated like crap [noise]\nHe may sit back you're my third grader sense that I understand what Lindsey to say that it was a little bit more entertaining\nThan I Am going to ask you I'm going to ask you to please their sort of conversation that we could have a conversation I Try I have nothing [noise]\nI really believe that Brett Kavanaugh is not a gang rape is a sexual predator stumbling bumbling drunks\nI really believe that and I don't care what you believe it or not I believe that 'cause I had known him for Twenty years\nI like doing it in front of the day there were many forums when I get pumped up about being in a in a land of opposition to them because why they have no problem doing it to you guys because I don't care what you think I Know the guy yeah\nAnd it gives if this had been done by a Republican we would have been chased out of town you have\nTo admit though it is disheartening to this country is so polarized right now and this and obviously it's not about sexual harassment I don't believe it's about temperament it's about making sure that homosexuality is normalized and abortion rights or or maintain I wanted to ...\nI Want to play for you a clip this is fascinating on Martha my column this past week with the moms march movement that's not the liberal moving the moms mark ... movement can Fletcher these women support Brett Kavanaugh this lady was sexually assaulted and listen to what she said how she dealt with it think\nKimberly that's the first question failures survivor of sexual assault we've seen a real bonding exercise a lot of women who have suffered and sexual assault who feel like it's finally their turn to stand up and be heard why do you not feel like that if someone who has been through this yourself well I think this idea of ...\nSomeone who has been through this yourself\nWell I think this idea of creating that the victim mentality is actually hurting our girls and I decided I was going to be a survivor and Victor he can chew don't choose whether or not you are victimized but you do choose whether or not you're a victim and I was on that to my the person who hurt me I was going to be the Victor and that they can't control me and so I\nYou know I Am the Victor I think we need to tell that to our girls you know\nIt's a very interesting perspective when you watched doctor Christine by the board and you're not find her credible [noise]\nI Know right now this goes to all you females or listen to his radio show where liberals come up and say how would you be against Dr Christie for she's a female listen to what Tim Fletcher says weren't\nCredible needs to be investigated it a little bit more I think she was compiling should definitely compelling and I do believe that there is definitely something that she feels that happened and it probably something probably did happened to her\nThat the idea that she could say one hundred percent that she knew who it was but she couldn't answer a lot of the other questions\nI think that's something that people need to start talking about the idea that women never lie and men always feel that sets up our men and are signs up for some disastrous effects and the teacher and and I wish that they would understand that's\nWhat they're doing by my marginalizing an act of assault or violence against a woman and turning it into a political tool or weapon\nActually diminishes the voice of every woman who ever maybe it's all data or had violence or or like I my case you know are you where you were left dead and\nNo one is going to believe you and how how could they when they're turning it into the political weapon and how can you say that you care about women when you're willing to do that and the women that I talked to I kept asking them the women who are all through the ducks and building with our believe women shirts\n[laughter] I said what if what if it's not true but if he didn't do it and what did they ... they said it doesn't matter it\nDoesn't matter but with the Turks and buildings where the Congress that doesn't matter of folks because he has been appointed by Donald Trump more the

driving voters to the polls next month the Fox news poll voters said in the economy and health care will be the most important to their vote for Congress has followed closely by party in control of the house and support for President Trump's immigration and guns around at the top five\nPresident Trump of course is it possible that he may be a big issue on the ballot but guess who is probably the biggest decide or a moving because the Democrats have pretty much control the enthusiasm gap\nOver the last several months Karl Rove former Bush White house official says when you look at the latest poll numbers out there by the Harris Poll also reports by the wall Street Journal Republicans are closing it\nAnd it's not really well maybe it could be based on Trump but on Brett Kavanaugh\nWell at the Republican enthusiasm is up a there was a very interesting poll out from Harvard Harris\nWhich shows that are for Republicans forty six percent of Republicans said they're absolutely certain devote\nA as a result of Kavanaugh fifty percent of Democrats and Republicans have trailed Democrats enthusiasm for several months now and so other Republicans have made up much more grounded and my sense is they could make up even more in the Harvard Harris\nAll right now listen to this this was about whether or not Kavanaugh after one week I mean if the if the FBI said say that he said she said\nThey go along with what happened before the FBI which just pretty much came out now report people are like I don't know if I don't know if this Kavanaugh guy listened to the latest poll numbers that if they find out there's nothing there against Kavanaugh what their turnaround would be\nPoll thirty seven percent of the people after the hearing last week so they favor the confirmation of cabin uh\nForty four opposed Eighteen undecided [laughter] they didn't ask what would happen if the FBI did an investigation and found no corroborating witnesses to the allegations sixty percent would favor confirmation\nForty percent would oppose and nobody lacked an opinion on it [noise] fifty two percent of dairy she'll be fifty percent of of independence would support confirmation and forty percent of Democrats would support confirmation if the FBI background check and found out ...\nInteresting um can I ask you a question of let's say those numbers are accurate let's say if the FBI came back and said hey there's nothing that I there are seven check\nForty percent of the Democrats poll say yeah we would support the confirmation then why isn't that forty percent of Democrats can

to get hold of the files first so they could use it to spend but yet believe it or not according to great Jared\nThose on the Democrats\nDo not want to release the file to the public\nAt I I find it amazing now that the very individual Dianne Feinstein who conceal information initially\nNow is attempting to conceal the FBI report mention demanded there's just been Corrine wildly out of control and the only way to slam the brakes on this imminent\nTrain wreck is to be open and honest in transparent and yet that's not what Dianne Feinstein why\nMaybe because she wants to misrepresent\nThe contents of that report which apparently offer absolutely no corroboration and only reputation of the ... oh oh I ...\nI thought elected officials want to transparency only when it comes to their best interest so heaven forbid that the public or the population of the American people should make the determination fact based on what they seemed is right or wrong\nYou know here's would be there's there's nothing in the report that's why the Democrats don't want the public to see if they don't want it to go out seal it put it in a safe for US Senate ... only let us see it and hopefully people

bit too far White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended her boss\nPresident was dating the facts every single word judge Kavanaugh said it's been picked apart if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them totally off limits an outrageous\nEven lower anger and says you know listen to president did say last week that he thought the evidence was pretty credible until the Mitchell Report came out that shows that there really wasn't anything there to back at Christine for comments [noise]\nHere man you're attacking the gun and he don't have any and say\nNo he's making a series of common sense conclusions\nAbout four and very shaking claimants and shifting accounts that were based on on corroborated memory or last week he said she came off it's quite credible but after that and they report comes out we begin to weigh what she said initially to what she said before the committee and it's a whole different story\nNow this is open up another discussion President Trump came out this past week and said it's a sad time to be a young man in this country I mean we asked the question the last week okay if your daughter had been accused excuse me if your daughter was accusing somebody of sexual molestation or rape\nBoy parents would be I mean who knows what would happen but I asked the question what would happen if your son\nHad been accused actress Alyssa mulatto says big deal she says this is nothing more than the pendulum swinging because now that all women should be believed this was one of those issues coming out now\nWomen young people have had it for coke for generations and generations and generations and we will not be silent any longer and if that means that men have a hard time right now I'm Sorry this is the way the meal and half the shift\nThis is the way the pendulum must shift editor from the daily wired up ... says wait a second no more due process for white men that have been accused yet we got to try to find out whether or not they did it or not\nI mean it's kind of shocking to suggest that due process shouldn't apply to men and I mean that that is the essence of sex and the idea that certain rules should not apply to people on the basis of their genetic\n... that that's that obviously discrimination of the highest order but this is the world in which we now live in which white men are presumed guilty because they're white men because they're supposedly in a position of privilege I wasn't aware that Brett Kavanaugh for for that his his for his presumption of innocence or due process of law simply because of the color of his skin or the nature of his genetics\nQuite interesting to see what happens what does this mean when it comes to the election coming up here in just a little bit Karl Rove\nFormer White House official says when you look at the latest numbers OK President Trump may be on the ballot in the mid term but the thing that's really drive and the Republicans as it shows the Democrats enthusiasm gap ... has pretty much evaporated has been all revolved around Brett Kavanaugh\nHere I think being in a position of those agents I Would I Would have the same thing with it or viewed capital code I interviewed a lousy forward there's you know they're locked into their statements before Congress under oath sworn testimony um both\nGave extraordinary low statements and testimony and they were really do need for\nOkay so what were you one of those that are maybe twenty twenty hindsight that do they do they not need to do another weeks' worth of investigation into some of the allegations that maybe they might have missed the six previous times of interviewing Dr Ford for applying to some of these federal positions and as a judge\nI'm I'm always you can always argue a tactic of delaying delay I wouldn't disagree with that but a week's worth I mean why Russia through to you think this was warranted yes or no\nI Do think it was worth it I think the American people needed this whether your gifts typical courtroom for ... the Judiciary Committee has already I mean they had all the evidence at age ... interviews they took the testimony it would be so few of these witnesses\nUm I think the American people needed it because it's going to come from ... already for through their ...\nWho is a senator investigators out there I mean they know what I find very interesting is that do have them on the Democratic side you have him on the Republican side two weeks ago the Democrats were invited\nHave their investigators to ask Kavanaugh questions leads a Christine for ... for my job to all these other guys and they decided not to show up\n[noise] yeah exactly because I think this was predisposed up your crew shows that are are there are there theory of hey let's not participate we'll see what the Republicans [noise] um let's go through the Erie which they did ... oh so they could go at the end of the same with eleventh hour ... hey look\nWe're witnesses we have all these other obligations we want the feds to investigate senator investigators we won't be if you are I think it was a soft boiled in before the before he finished\nJamie ... you've seen them on Fox News as a security analyst former co task force member with the FBI here in the state of Florida here's another interesting take on this or if you and I love listening to the audience hypotheticals whatever give me a short list I don't care what two or three give me something that you thought should have been asked\nA doctor for that was maybe illiterate you alluded to but not followed up\nYou would have asked you know I think\nI think the first thing that uh the chairman should've asked her up for the here and even started I think both should have been taken given polygraphs her suggested that committee view them or minister polygraphs to both capital air for 'em\nI ever thought about why why why you need to set it investigators giving them ... not some private company\nAbsolutely I mean while you're sitting at best a is there evidence so they need to administer that through their own people with\nYou you you could get who's that guy Connie Chung husband what's his name is ... ... more Republicans talk with him to do what he does every day in his talk show\nYeah that was like a circus exactly\nBut I think that would have been to one of the top what else would you would ask questions\nOh absolutely but um you you would ask pointed questions for to take a polygraph river warriors I'm the guy ended up asking too cautious which was absolutely silly I'm you know the ... is a person who's going to see the truth the machine confirms the tree\nAll right Jamie ... former passwords member of the FBI I'll make one of their little side issue before I let you go um the the Rosen steam the FBI or we hear reports were a couple of lawyers have been let go with the Mueller investigation which has maybe the wrapping up maybe they don't have anything there what are you hearing\nYou know the exact same thing I heard that Mueller actually was tried to go with ... ... people for short is like Manafort ... or ... or ... but\nI Would be just to that investigation is completed um their way to agree to come up with a ... for the interview the president which I don't think it's going to happen though I think the state will be wrapped up by the end of October for what I hear\nA interesting Jamie carbon ... good to have you on today you guys stay\nTriples you talk triple to eight to five five I that that's probably one of the best ones I haven't even heard from the audience you know you could have asked a question\nOf Dr Kavanaugh Dr Christine forward with it let's say you were up there as instead of a and you really get a question or you

House the White House came out early this morning about four AM said hey we don't see the new there the Democrats members of the Judiciary Committee habit here with the latest on that Fox News' Mike Emanuel\nCopy of that FBI report will come here to Capitol Hill after it goes to the White House it will be kept in a safe in the Senate Judiciary committee all one hundred and senators and just sign staffers will be authorized to read it and some Democrats are complaining it is not going to be thorough enough ads for voting thinking is here's how it could all play out\nStarting with it tonight on a layover day tomorrow Dave free friday potentially would be a procedural vote in a final passage hurt on confirmation would take place on Saturday So they want final confirmation by the end of the week we need to get the ball rolling Ron Davis\nI've always said sometimes in order to get to the joy you've got to go through the pain I experienced and all three days a week go to the gym having said that a ... is it do you think he's confirmed\nI that that's a tough question still at this point is there really is there enough pressure on Murkowski in college I don't think the for red state Democrats are going to\nGo I think they're going to save the latest poll numbers I think they well you know that's interesting take hold on if if the if you don't sound like Heidi Heitkamp Bill Nelson has got to vote for this guy but let's see the bill Nelson was even down by ten points they figure they're going to lose I Would think they vote their conscience Matt and not vote for Kavanaugh\nRight now I I heard you're on the radio earlier about the polling and various uh a state and when these are down ... how about Joe mansion he's in a very tough right now I don't think he's a crazy ... a Democrat say I'm pretty sure he'll probably vote for a cap and\nHere's the latest now you'd think anything if you couldn't get more mass job great Jared Fox News legal analyst says that the Democrats do not want this report to be made public even Raj and I know this will be leaked because why because they want to spend that their own way and\nI I find it amazing now that the very individual Dianne Feinstein who conceal information initially now is it tempting to conceal the FBI will have war\nDemanded that this is being Corrine wildly out of control and the only way to slam the brakes on this imminent train wreck it's me open and honest in transparent and yet that's not what Dianne Feinstein why maybe because she wants to misrepresent\nThe contents of that report which apparently offer absolutely no corroboration and only refutation of the\nLet me tell you what I think Ron I mean it now the liberals are sitting back on okay even now let's see he is confirmed let me give you thirty reasons why he should not be sexual allegations he's too extreme now it's\nJudicial temperament but by the way I never understood why these guys credibility is never question you forgot what he can't hold his liquor again or at least ... people to ice tea ... females the word but he's been Kavanaugh throws\nDo you watch the ... and calls females to be war but we've been Kevin all through his eyes\nAnd yet now he's judicial temperament you know I hear that from a lot of people running for office here locally run for judge will I get to a judicial temperament boo I don't care I Want to know where you stand on a case one way or the other out there and the bottom line is that they didn't like the way that he talk back to the last week bottom\nLine and they weren't going to like\nAnything he said why good or bad if he came in and it was quiet to mirror like he had been in the Fox interview the night before they would have said oh he appeared guilty ... there was nothing that he could say or do that was going to change that they were prepared to say anything was a disaster anyway he testified\nIn South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham are making that very point\nAbout this just had the temping temperament and the judge is when that tends to be the most would you react if somebody destroyed ... then you found yourself in front of the entire nation thing humiliating put what'd you do if you saw this man is yelling\nLast old man who was offended those core\nBennett his good name [noise]\nTook it to the people are trying to destroy his family would you do if you're in that situation so this idea that somehow his temperament and question here rewarding\nThe worst behavior I've seen in Twenty years if you buy that garbage to any Republican\nHis temperament for this hearing was aimed plus plus according to a BA do let these people\nWho what they've done to judge Kavanaugh and\nIt's amazing that these people go on to Democrats just guys coming alive for kind of like would you like on the city council lifetime appointment but anyway so he would like a lifetime lifetime for ... for years by kid with you it's a little fun sometimes does look alike but saying that these senators want a lifetime\nTo be up there but don't ever mentioned that but they didn't have any not a non ... they can be a what's the word I Would say non temperament of hair rod they can have a a a temperature problem they can they can be all kicked off the cabinet but yet he's got to remain calm\nBut I think as a judge and I'm not there were you asked about earlier about the views they can't have you say look at the law and determine what what is the course of action going forward the Democrats or don't like this you know I'm In fact my son asked me a question why are they going to go ... because he wasn't the deciding vote on\nKim pleasure where the moms march movement they support Brett Kavanaugh and they don't find and then here's a woman who was sexually assaulted she says hey I was going to be a victim yeah the guy was going to\nPay but is there a difference between not being able to remember all the details and giving getting some of it right and being a liar but then again if you can't give all the details you have any type of credibility well she's in her mind believes those details are out on her mind\nYou her mind Ron How do you\nTake any something like this you can't and that's why you need to have people with level heads saying you know what she's being used by the Democrats someone with a role to hold on wait wait wait in Roger's\nMind he's the greatest news director out there but you want to know to prove that they know the audience that I mean this is Roger against the best way to say you got the bachelor that's how you determine ... go ahead Ron ... sounds\nLike you might question at my issue is is she telling the truth Gina definitely a political point she's definitely being used by the Dems yes I still believe based on our history as a political activists and this goes to wasn't a new ad earlier\nWhat question would you live and I want to know what was on her social media right or the three or four months apart because that will confirm she was a political\nActivist and I'm ... I said it two weeks ago and I'll say it again she is a willing martyr for the cause of abortion that all this is\nNow if something happened to her I have no clue or not and everybody says oh she was so incredible she was so believable she was so coached\nOkay so so a politician says so believable ... at the end of the day I just don't believe that not this incident happened\n... let's go to Greg Greg good morning run W.

front to back it was started my wife\nA beginning and I thought yeah there's something about to happen to her but then the more I thought about it but more of the things that didn't add up the more I have to say I believe she lived in our study or a tell you why\nI think she thought that she was probably one of the smartest people in the room of course you know Dr Ford she's got a PHD\nIn one thing in returning will tell you when you're asked in a deposition questions or ... or in a in a trial do you answer that question yet don't reveal anything career you make you make the other side work for those answers but she would do\nAnything career you make you make the other side work for those answers but she would go off and she would say things that we're not even related but uh later on you could put those together and see that she was telling the truth\nAnd I I think for instance there's a you know she claimed that she was not a good like the fly an airplane so now we know that she had a boyfriend truck around the ... the Hawaiian Islands in a trial\nRight ... yeah I've only got about forty minutes left the shell but having said that I appreciate the call but\nYou know he makes a valid point you only answered this answer that in the ex boyfriend this whole sorted into he said if she's that Ron as a trial lawyer I keep saying let's keep it in perspective I don't care\nI don't want to hear about some CIA a thing that has nothing to do with his stick with the issues at hand and the bottom line here is that they haven't corroborating blah blah blah blah blah and yet you still don't think that he's going to get confirmed huh\n[noise] no I I'm I'm not sure I I don't I disagree I don't think I think the the Democrats in red state had been provided to cover they needed to say no it's going to come down to Collins and Murkowski how they go I don't know Murkowski I have serious doubts about let me give you the latest numbers Karl Rove\nFox News contributor the Democrats search is still up but it's a bath rated and it has to deal with one man Brett Kavanaugh listen to the latest poll numbers here\nWell at the Republican enthusiasm is up a there was a very interesting poll out from Harvard Harris which showed that uh were Republicans forty six percent of Republicans said they are absolutely certain devote\nA as a result of Kavanaugh fifty percent of Democrats and Republicans a trail Democrats enthusiasm for several months now and so other Republicans have made up much more grounded and my sense\nIs okay now this is where it gets interesting the member last\nWeek a lot of conservatives understandably so hey why we have an ... another week at the FBI kick the can down the road listen how it might benefit the GOP\nThey could make up even more in the Harvard Harris Poll\nThirty seven percent of the people after the hearing last week so they favor the confirmation of cabin uh\nForty four opposed Eighteen on the side and then ask what would happen if the FBI did an investigation and found no corroborating witnesses to the allegations sixty percent would favor confirmation forty percent would oppose and nobody elected opinion on it\nFifty two percent of their excuse me fifty percent of of independence would support confirmation and forty percent of Democrats would support confirmation if the FBI background check and found out\nThere you go you got a week's worth of cover without more accusations with to come out forty percent of Democrats that if nothing comes back to incriminate him confirmed the guy\nBut first of all I Would say I I don't know why they don't relate information but I also I'm appalled at\nThe grass he reached out to her or lawyer to do a very private meeting by the way it shouldn't have been done on televised TV they could have done all this discussion between Kevin ... for behind closed door there was one reason to do it and that is the throat Kevin on the bus\n... supposedly she said that she was never told that correctly what fly out to Arizona to interview\nPoint is if it was all a stage and they could have done this before behind closed doors we don't know\nWho were you worried with me you're more I mean Ronda is a lawyer humid one of the political ground I've covered more the politics for years I I'm not a conspiracy guy but I wouldn't be surprised if not maybe not the senators perhaps but maybe your people called my people you know what I'm saying\nAnd they sent back into a lesson ... trumpet a numbers and the women that the Republicans aren't going to challenge this they're going to cow town blah blah blah I think I Wonder if that's what happened and they were able to convince Dr forward to going into that a Judiciary Committee\nThat might be but you know the Senate supposed to be advice and consent they're not going to do what they're doing in\nThe rye you agree with\nMe no I agree with you and in fact there are several Democrats the last week has expressed surprise or even shock that Brett Kavanaugh didn't one did not withdraw his his nomination and to the Republicans did not abandoned him they really felt that this was all going to fall apart with that allegation\nYeah when when you don't mad when these guys come in and gals and say well this is already pre determined the White House did this White House did that may I ask the question it was already pretty determined but all you'll eleven members on the Senate Judiciary committee now the Democrat side it didn't matter before the hearings even took place you all said you worked in a bed for ...\n... this is what makes me there's no reason there's no reason\nThat people can't have an open mind and all these people say no and yes before actually meeting him you can read his resume and by the way I mentioned earlier that light it can it can use on the Supreme Court actually was dean of Harvard Business go law school and invited a\nCabin ought to be up there and speak to them she obviously he's a great guy to\nTripled to talk ... triple to eight to five five talk radio W.

B. O. B.\nContact and the summers and one more call to two\nTo five ... ... email and then when you read more as\nWe continue to move along I like to also asked the question if Republicans have evaporated the enthusiasm gap from the Democrats why is Andrew Gillum so leading in the polls who's got a better ground game right now Democrats or Republicans here in Florida I Love to hear from you coming up next on TALK radio WB of [noise]\nI still think into many areas\nIn in in the in the west part of the of the United states and maybe in the northeast they're going to pick up some Republican seats that that we are all so I I think it's going to be more of a a blue trickle uh in in the house the Senate um I'm a little more optimistic than most people most people are saying it's going to be one seat pickup I still see it as a two or three the pickup\nDo really I mean if you don't wait until we play that out a few weeks back where fifty seven percent according to the RMC elite poll I that that Trump supporters ain't going to be no blue wave and they thought it would be too complacent and not even show up at the polls Ross says that may be different now because of ...\nI think it might be but at the initial reaction of a Gillum actually being so far ahead in the polls and winning and has the enthusiasm over dissent is\nThat the a consensus and I tend to agree with him it would hurt a Rick Scott is going to hurt it was originally got hurt rich guy and it would also help the down ballot that almost all the cabinet positions and it's up until recently I understand that all the cabinet positions or faint rain democratic\nExcept a Ashley muti ah going forward so maybe to turn the tide has turned in that regard but there was a huge concern that down ballot for if you voted for Gail I'm you're going to vote for the Democrats although on the cabinet\nAnd see that and that's the state of Florida here's here's the unique and I know a lot of people in that you might you might disagree with me on this Gillum presents\nA unique problem for Republicans in Florida because he is black\nAnd I think this is going to go back to the two thousand eight type turnout where you're going to have Ninety five percent of blacks voting\nThirty and forty percent more than ever voted before that turned out I think is what we Republicans have to figure out how do we counter how do we how do we soften that because it will definitely affect the doubt I mean Rick Scott should win idol walking away\nYou know in in the other areas like for example mia Jones running for tax collector Tracy pulse and running for state house I think it's quite possible is put the Republicans on notice I don't disagree with that and other areas um who did help put her her I think it could help\nThose outlets Roger sit down on the down ballot of Democrats I think it's it could I mean the question is guild could still is Democrats can still pick up and I remember they tell you lost the Ninety to watch it in the house of representatives to pick up nine seats by the Republicans and I think Rick Scott's in real danger on that because of that because I Do\nYeah you don't see Gillum campaigning with a Bill Nelson\nI think bill and brings out a huge amount of black voters they're going to vote down and and I think\nIt's been only down and yeah but it ... it is without valid but that doesn't know and a Scottish above that\nSo I don't know but they I I in the race Scott walks away either if if the black community and it includes mayor Jones I write and I almost want because of this\nFor years I've talked to two when we done stories we've talked to Democrats that have sat back and said off the record and an off year election and they were ... you know we do a lot of those from the black committed they they don't come out and the and blah blah blah blah and saying that may turn around I I Would agree with you I'm not I wouldn't be surprised\nBut then again if Guillen is doing predominately quite well especially among white voters which he is by the way white female special white females and diversity issues yet yeah\nThey are the ad but now they're saying is that ... but then you make the argument one way or the other whether you agree with you or not that those in the black community aren't voting on the issues there just because he's black yes so\nI don't know of black people vote for a candidate just because they're like Roger Roger Roger Ailes for that ... that suggests they say that the blacks are probably Ninety Ninety two percent democratic no matter where you are right and not necessarily black or white would agree with you on them you ask you a question why did this answers when\nHe was one guy was called Donald trial was going to say you know the Donald Trump era I used to think that you know endorsements matter at all unless there was a sheriff\nNow it seems like it matters a lot about does it hold on hold I Love her who was who is better\nEquipped better knowledgeable on state issues tend to one Adam ... and ... and was up so people will vote yes on sometimes but now may based on color I greatly when based on the Democratic because all the ... and it's a hat that says make America great again but go ahead yeah most almost\nAll the people I talked to ... uh for such a county ... they would they would have voted on a without um ... no matter what these Democrats they're they're much less ... has the tend to vote to scientists or or Gillum and I don't think either party is particularly happy with their candidate you\nKnow right truly I I disagree I just like the Republicans are happy with the census now if you're in the Trump guy are establishment ... Republicans you know I don't know I don't either I'm selling point on I ... as they are not happy\n... did not become a dirty campaign from disadvantaged society became a little bit if you want to call it that side from putting them so I think that they're going to get behind Ron I think some people they look at the polling numbers I mean we we were deported this past several days you've got lobbyist in Tallahassee open Republican lobbyist ever given money to go there look in a poll numbers going on\nAnd so that could be a lack of maybe they don't see enough grass roots out there or they don't see enough coming from Ronda Santa\nI Would say that Ron has not done it real good job because he basically was on Fox News and Trump he did not have the ground game you're talking about the going forward clearly there's a lot of people that gave it to putting them now that now to me to get on the fence as as a a train the give a donation and make sure that that becomes\nBut Thanks This is a a train to give a donation and make sure that there's this becomes a Republican governorship\nAnd I think a lot of north Florida Republicans are frustrated with the sand just because they're not seeing him they're not seeing evidence of him but this goes back to your poll if he's behind by twenty seven points in South Florida but he's pretty even her up and the other where'd you go to spend his time and that's where he's been spending his time in South Florida and went\nInto the earlier saying all the ads former running on T. V. down there where he needs them\nSo we feel neglected and I knew agree that his campaign needs to do a better job of of\nGetting a face up here I think he had his running mate up here last week uh I think he needs to come up here and spend a little later learned\nWas here last week or last ones that you know met an anticipated math was a sponsor of it OK so anyways I can hear my wife one here's a quick question struck down your wife 'cause every political event\nI don't know why I'm like you're looking a lot better looking than I Am that's already smarter having said that um can't dissented when my kids because we we're we're in an article where he talks less about what he would do as a governor\nCame to Santas one real quick answer\nCan dissenters when less about him more posing a Gillum and his record I think it's going to have to\nBe about you know because people don't know people have an answer to get up at the same Ron\nI I think it's going to be about the issues I think it's going to be the dollar figure what is what are the cost of Gillum measures ... the people know what they need to know about the sand is in Gillum at this point when it comes down to how we're going to pay for these things I I think that's really where this ... this race is going to ...\nYou know as I get a good does NATO does need to talk more about the issues and break down the math that's going to be would would would carries over if it is\nNot going to break it down right now forty seven minutes after the our talk radio WB obey\nChinese that Stockton and there's been a crash on the left we see back up all the traffic jams two Ninety five north of metals wrote another accident and two Ninety five south at I turn another wreck there this\nMorning I'm ... the president of under woods if you want to know the most important thing about diamonds beauty\nThe answer would be the way it's could there's a trade off between the dam and cut for maximum beauty in one cut for maximum weight and it's seen in the price you see damning cutters by rough diamonds based on weight so all the dam and wait to cut away can affect their profit\nBut because they're known cutting parameters for the ideal or most beautiful diamond deviations from these well heeled heavier unless beautiful damning\nUnfortunately customers can't detect cutting imperfections without expert hill and in fact diamonds\nHave the same weight color and clarity can vary in value by as much as fifty percent or more just because of the way it's cut it under woods we look at how a damning just got first and we have the computer as Jemma logical equipment to determine the quality of the cut in the light performance of the damage to see if the damage you carry the Underwood name\nSo quality counts when he stopped by under woods in San Marco Avondale in the shops ... attention\nAll men lie ahead rancid Alice lead you down I think your best days are behind you think again if you suffer from any type of eat the regardless of redrawing medical history for doctors of out from medical group can help you now\nThere's no pain no needles no surgery no medication\nJust some new stuff they level proven treatment from Europe\nUsing are too strict energy ways\nOur FDA cleared medical device regenerate blood vessels ... with the short in office session and it's all done with virtually no pain no needles do surgery and no medication call now for full information coal mine on forty seven six three fourteen hundred ... four to seven six three fourteen hundred\nOne hundred percent natural non invasive way to fix or exiled this function call nine or forty\nSeven percent free fourteen hundred today and get your life back for the alpha medical group\nCalled nine or forty seven cents three fourteen hungry for visit our website at alpha medical\nGroup dot com transmission problems call actually transmission specialist so narrow road before you get the work done right the first\nTime by the experts I'm Robin said marry the owner are texting service all makes models and we provide and nationwide more energy so you have the peace of mind knowing we solve your transportation for almost fairly and honestly hair and guaranteed nationwide calling us action transmission specialist on Marilyn word or quality counts\nGet traction for all action at seven four four zero seven five five", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "04"}
