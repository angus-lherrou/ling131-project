know we know how now that it's good to have you back right you've got to have you back like you it\nMore as we continue to move along at dean Roger Anderson let's get to it what will I get a taste of Rogers exciting as a week it was the last several days I'm really looking forward to ... this week as you just pointed out while there is a pending FBI investigation on why we're going to do at the moment what you I think we all do\nThe U.S Senate does formally begin consideration of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination the question is what will happen is really anything there are some Democrats are kind of Hindi there may not be anything there\nBut if you listen to the George Stephanopoulos along with New York congressman Jerry Nadler that won't stop them the Democrats say if they wanted the U.S house of representatives they will investigate Brett Kavanaugh and\nIrish and want to pick up on one person the close he was saying All right there are a lot of Democrats have said that they don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh told the truth when he went before the Judiciary Committee which it if it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee would you invest seen him for a possible impeachment\nIt's a real problem recalling the ability the entire Senate crisis I Would hope that the sins of the quake and others\nWould not vote we would make clear that their votes cannot be will not be for the nominee unless they have a ... there was a ... for proper investigation of these very serious allegations of sexual assaults we cannot have a justice on the Supreme Court\nAh for the next several decades will be deciding questions of liberty in life and death and all kinds of things for the entire American people who has been credibly accused of sexual assaults who's been credibly accused of various other\nUh um um things\nAnd ruin things including perjury this has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so is he is on the Supreme Court and and the Senate haven't investigated than anything else will have to\nInvestigate we would have to investigate any credible allegations certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before now\nFolks there's a lot of what he said right there without giving you and he spent did you not hear what he says if there is not a credible investigation guaranteeing to you because I'm a political profit I mean it was predominantly not that anybody cares\nThey will sit back and say remember Chris Coons that we need one week investigation that's all we need and even members of the FBI said I can only take a few days\nNow they're already hinting at the FBI investigation may not take long enough if it does not take long enough they will investigate themselves to the Democrats when the U.S house also there was a report by the hill dot com over the weekend that wanna Brett Kavanaugh's roommates or friends from college says he misled Congress on his\nCapability of whether or not he can hold his alcohol now whether or not he passed out now folks I'm not a drinker I never happened ... what is this what it boils down to\nWhether or not you can hold your alcohol or a year but this is a really seriously a a A R A L American history and we can only pray that good will eventually rise to the top and the right things are done\nWhile very statesman like levy Roger I tried to be but when it comes to sexual assault in the park or see Steve hill from the next revolution says really the Democrats really\nI agree and I can think of one person at the ticket and needs to understand Cory Booker and self in college he wrote a thoughtful article examining Paul sexual misdeeds including groping women without consent while she was drunk credit back then but could use the incident to highlight his own evolution on these issues\nBut in ... new book exchanging salacious messaging\nWhere the flooding but the ... of course his fine see how that goes down to like me to meeting senator is another massive hypocrite ranking Judiciary Committee member die and find out\nSexual violence is a serious problem and one largely goes unseen why young women are standing up and saying no more our institutions have not progressed and how they treat women who come forward\nNow that was from Senator die and finds I Believe it or not by the way there was an investigation being called who kind of leak or allow the letter of Christine for to be released but\nAnyway back to the topic here dying find science as we can allow these things to go astray we need to go after the individuals here listening to what Steve Hilton talks about who died bind science close friend was in somebody she idolized\nThat ... stuff so that pretty busy when you consider how close Bernstein was an a Taurus woman either Ted Kennedy here's what she said when he died\nHe was a collie and inspiration and a friend I have seen up close to his dedication to issues of civil rights human rights and basic fairness to all the women have exploited right Senator Feinstein Ted Kennedy's sexual incontinence\nIncluded in Nineteen Ninety report of being caught having sex public all the poor but Washington DC restaurant with a lobbyist how these swampy\nAt least she lived to tell the tale poor Mary Jo ... Kennedy to drown at Chappaquiddick how can I find to be taken seriously ill sexual violence when she called Ted Kennedy and inspiration\nYet how far will just continue to go Lindsey Graham says there's a major double standard and what we saw that took place on friday\nI had done what Democrats have done\nIf I had recommended a conservative activists lawyer against the Democratic nail amount of money on a case or came forward and South Carolina and I hit it\nAnd I didn't tell the committee about it I Would be destroyed the double standard here is unacceptable and we're finally going to do something about it\nI kept asking last week was okay it would wait a second I mean the the Dems are going to trust the FBI to do a week's worth a background check that some say may only take a few days but yeah this is the same FBI that we've had problems about whether or not Hillary lied misled she didn't\nYeah this is the same FBI that we've had problems about whether or not Hillary lied misled she didn't do it about the FBI and the Trump dot CA Maria bart's aroma from Fox Business\nNetwork that but I mean we didn't trust in the FBI here after all the way in his car insurance out there are people out there and try to put your finger on a scale and kick back and say hey what's your trustworthiness and the cat in the next week and we haven't really kept take away\nYou know Roger I Am I'm thoroughly convinced that this is what's going to boil down to you they're not going to believe that the FBI investigation Chris Coons a Democrat is that called for a week hopefully maybe they can buy more sexual allegations and that's what they're doing who are against Brett Kavanaugh the he said she said that they are going to come up with an by friday this week and say well it wasn't long enough we need at least have another three to four days\nNew York here's what he had to say he didn't he will increase by three percent this year and two and a half percent and twenty Nineteen [laughter] the unemployment rate ... slightly below three and a half percent next year facts in place and it adds up a bit above two percent but it does not see\nGreater inflationary pressures on the horizon so that would be the sweet spot for inflation the recovery has been on that not everyone has equal in the otherwise from economy by the Federal Reserve is going down to ... minutes and it statement that\nEven though they're going to do that it does not signify except in monetary policy\nSo the question is is how much will the fed I mean this again you had an Obama economy which a lot of the federal government of all by notes of course the quantitative easing this area you don't have it but the question is how this two thousand in Nineteen I mean it's just around the corner here Roger ... into the first week of October\nFox Business Tuesday can McDonald says you know all these people out there that don't think two thousand and Nineteen she says the tax cuts deregulation I don't see things slow now I\nAm and politically too I think that the Democrats are over ... trying to talk down an economy trying to [noise]\nAnd then even hoodwinked individuals in this country who are benefiting from the tax cuts are benefiting from this incredibly strong job market and you see that and the consumer confidence that these numbers aren't just pretty good\nThey are also a a ten year high for consumer confidence factor I sat there and the strongest growth that we've seen and for ten years we haven't had three percent and grows and any one calendar hair and more than a decade\nSo again to try and talk down and this is that this is a ... a political hammer at some individuals are trying to years there's no evidence and by the way we haven't seen an expansion that did start and two thousand and I we haven't seen a major major Ben and cat that corporate spending and\nLending or in housing no reason to think that this expansion could continue in order for that but certainly north at their own\nAs she says all those markets out there really haven't got the benefit and remember the economists said Roger for later this year we are at the beginning of next year we may see the the attrition to flourish in\nThat I could just be fancy here most of what may happen with the tax cuts remember a lot of people said you won't see the tax bill until next year of all the money you may have said no you hope you'll see more bonuses this year okay but they come up with a tax breaks from next year that hopefully should trickle down some of the deductions that people will see the benefit coming up next tax you know three\nPercent four percent GDP which everyone gets good two percent said would be better than what we had a couple of years ago when I think everything has to do\nAnd my question to you and is this what point did people start talking about bubbles is is is is the economy is so good that it's kind of artificially good or we I Know we're not a bad place right now but do you anticipate it's being there at some point\nI don't know it depends on what bubble you look at certain sectors that's how you look at it and these are like for example you but at one point five trillion said most students college loan debt out there and they say that could be the next big bubble that have a major effect to nose Carl owning a bubble I don't know if that's going to be big enough to\nDefault the economy but we will continue to see what happens Roger when people think of the Supreme Court of course to thinking of Brett Kavanaugh stopping that he writes for minorities algae Beatty going after abortion\nShana brain for Fox News that you know this month is when the beginning of the two thousand Eighteen thousand Nineteen Supreme Court session kicks in stocks news again legal endless Jana brain says this is what's coming up with a session\nThat Supreme Court in coming months may in front of other divisive issues whether a forty foot Latin cross honoring World War one veteran's violates the prohibition of government endorsement of religion whether bans on plastic guns made from a three D printer violate the second amendment\nState regulations on surrogate pregnancy and for Medicaid science use for abortion\nLimits I think the academic power an ongoing challenge to President Trump's immigration environmental and regulatory policies\nSo there's a there's a lot that you hear right there that again is not all about abortion you have one about a day like California that was a pretty much come out Roger and said listen we don't think there should be taxpayers\nMonday or a taxpayer funded to promote in abortion whatsoever now remember last year ... this past session I should say that\nRemote in abortion whatsoever that remember last year ... this past session I should say that happened this past year there were pro life groups that were trying to be forced to promote abortions as an alternative but yet they sat back it excuse me step back and said wait a second we don't receiving the government money for doing a service why should we be forced to do that\nYou know what the book the book with groups like Planned Parenthood they are getting government money now they're saying they're not using it for abortion but all that does is free up their other Monday to use for abortion because now we're supplement or the other things so I don't consider that that's really a strong argument\nRemember the hearing last week Brett Kavanaugh was heavily heavily being challenged of what took place thirty six years ago and what he wrote in a high school yearbook and whether or not he was being truthful remember Sheldon Whitehouse Democrat was\nGoing after the Supreme Court nominee by President Trump\nThe word you use the answer if your early ...\nI like that I like beer I don't know if you'd okay like beer center or not um what do you like the tricks on is or what do you\nView I don't know if it's a book or move how do you pronounce that\nRefers to flash short and sweet sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your ... page back to you eat the same meaning it was actually\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection well into flatulence a sixteen year book page\nOn some games\nDot com came out over I think it was over the weekend they talked about how that one of the cabinet as friends back I guess in college said that he misled tigers because he didn't tell the truth about whether or not he passed out\nFrom a drinking stupid really I mean it's just what it boils down to the Supreme Court pick your you know alcohol yearbook noise six years ago ...\nThey're they're looking you know here's here's the thing I I Believe the doctor for its testimony who's credible and she she was very convincing a lot of emotion there what\nA pass on the other quarter ... let me ask you that but\nI don't know because when you have his word against her her work witnesses then you look for other they would have passed and a quarter of a non would he be convicted in a courtroom absolutely not because look at it and then another ... none of the witnesses that she says we're there remember anything that's what I was getting at and a quarter of All right but now we are we going all the due process out there we should not\nBut yeah we should have the Democrats are going to yeah I mean we got a lot of emails and we're going to get to those coming up here just to live a lot of emails from listeners\nOn this issue and here's a question I like to ask you\nWas there something that was counted out by the Republicans or is it likely does it give them a here's a question to ask you does it get them political cover to have the FBI investigation this week over the Republicans to we need to allow this to happen but then again maybe they looked at numbers and realize they didn't have the numbers so they need to go along\nWith an FBI\nInvestigation will continue to cover this more as we continue to move along talk radio W.

B. O. B.\nThis week yes this week Roger the Supreme Court begins its two thousand in Eighteen two thousand and Nineteen session but according to the news reports is covered with a dark cloud because it's four to four that's the reason why you need to rush so you can have a five to for the Democrats keep asking what's the rush what's the rush\nBut Shannon brain from Fox News legal analyst tells you what the issues will be coming up this session in front of the Supreme Court\nRecording coming mind may confront other divisive issues whether a forty foot Latin cross honoring World War one veterans and violates the prohibition of government endorsement of religion whether bans on plastic guns made from a three D printer violate the second amendment\nState regulations on surrogate pregnant at the end for Medicaid time to use for abortion\nLimits I think that could empower an ongoing challenge to President Trump's immigration environmental and regulatory policy\nYet we heard from the left at the next Supreme Court nominees could derail those in the butt in the minority humidity when it comes to minority rights the Obama health care and everything else and with abortion and algae BT but you kind of heard it right there it doesn't really boil around those issues\nBut yet the big one this week of course whether or not the FBI is going to have a lot of leeway\nTo do a one week an investigation and by the way that was what the Democrats had asked for was a one week\nInvestigation into Brett Kavanaugh to find out any sexual miss allegations that took place but yet whether or not that happens if the U.S house of representatives falls into the hands of the Democrats\nAccording to ABC's George Stephanopoulos this week interviewing newer congressman Gerry ... the question was asked what you guys investigative Kavanaugh's confirmed\nTen harsh will want to pick up on what the person was was he was saying our rights are a lot of Democrats have said that they don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh told the truth when he went before the Judiciary Committee say if it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee would you investigated for possible impeachment\nSo real problem recalling to believe that the the entire Senate process I Would hope that says since the quake and others\nWould not vote we would make clear that their votes cannot be will not be for the nominee unless they have a ... there was a ... for proper investigation of these very serious allegations of sexual assaults we kind of\nA free hand ever proper investigation you heard it here first one week will not be a a proper amount of time even though that's what the Democrats asked for\nThey will want an extension they will throw the White House under the bus for all of this even though the White House doesn't dictate FBI policy whatsoever this will not make them happy da\n... whether or not this is going to end up triggering a conversation about Cory Booker maybe getting impeach from the U.S Senate because she wrote a book or an essay saying that he grow up to a woman\nHis own words while she was passed out and or if this is the standard by which you know a a an unconfirmed allegations against capital could keep 'em off the Supreme Court why not confirmed allegations of Cory Booker\nJustice on the Supreme Court ah for the next several decades will be deciding questions of liberty in life and death and all kinds of things for the entire American people who has been credibly accused of sexual assaults who's been credibly accused of various other\nUh um\nYeah things and ruin things including perjury this has got to be thoroughly investigated\nBy the way ... okay so I mean this gets better ... so now he says that whether I Will be a proper investigation by the FBI\nOf course remember it was Chris Coons along with a compromise they said all we need is one week to do a proper investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's pass\nThen you just heard about perjury he'll dot com has a story out over the last couple of days that say that some of ... one excuse me of somebody who went through a college with Brett Kavanaugh misled Congress because\nWell you tell the truth about whether or not he passed out from drinking\n... they're throwing everything they can of ... right now and the ... of the Senate remains Republican after November there are going to be a justice was nominated\nPope the Senate will do so is he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to\nInvestigate we would have to investigate any credible allegations certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before so they\nDo there you go that's the U.S house of representatives if they fall into the hands of the Democrats have said that they will investigate\nBrett Kavanaugh and FBI investigation do we need to go back in time remember former then Delaware

something about it\nAnd yet President Trump says you know are just as they brought in a very valid point last week he says what if there is an FBI investigation with the Democrats changed their tune he says of course they well but he says maybe the FBI investigation is a blessing in disguise\nBlessing in disguise because having the FBI\nDead yeah if I was in ... uh FBI investigator I Would I
