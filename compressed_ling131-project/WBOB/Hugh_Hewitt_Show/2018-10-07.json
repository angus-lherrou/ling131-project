David Jeremiah explains why has he shares them in more than ...\nYears David to introduce today's message come on get real\nThis is turning point and I'm David Jeremiah and today we're talking about an encounter DeJesus had is recorded in the seventh chapter of mark\nAnd this encounter illustrates the fact that a lot of people today like to define how goodness works and their life by looking at outward things but God doesn't accept the outward approach she only looks at the heart\nThe Bible says in the Old Testament that a man looks on the outward appearance but God looks on the heart\nWhat an illustration of that we're going to find in today's discussion we've called it come on get real markets\nYounger seven thanks for joining us\nUp until this point in the gospel of mark we have been examining the works of Jesus and we told you at the very beginning of our study that mark is more of an activity book it's about what Jesus\nDid not so much about what he said but here in the center of the book for just a few chapters\nThat gets turned upside down and we began to hear Jesus teaching and it's interesting it's some of the most vibrant and important and visceral teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ you will find anywhere in the gospels\nHere in this section we have the most important words of Jesus in the book of mark\nAnd our story begins today with an accusation notice the accusation in versus one through five of mark seven [noise]\nThen the ... and some of the scribes came together to Jesus having come from Jerusalem and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with ... that is fun washed hands they found fault\nFor the fairest sees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way holding the tradition of The Elders when they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash\nAnd there are many other things which they have received and hold like the washing of cops and pictures and copper vessels have couches\nAnd then the first season describes asked to Jesus and said to him why do you weren't disciples not walk according to their edition of The Elders but they eat their bread with on washed hands\nDuring the transition between Judaism and Christianity there seem to have been a city in committee in Jerusalem called the watchdog committee\nAnd their whole purpose in life was to find fault they were the fault finding committee we have some classes in churches these days that have that motivation there the finding committee they believe that God has signaled them out to find fault with everything that they see\nAnd so in Jerusalem there was a group of leaders who sort of kept their eyes on what was going on in\nThe greater realm of religion and when they saw something that they didn't say was right they sent their investigative committee to check it out\nAnd so this committee comes to where Jesus is and his disciples and they're filled with ammunition they've already watched the disciples refused to fast they've already seen the disciples break the Sabbath\nBut now they have observed them eating with on wash hands better translated with unrest tense 'cause it really wasn't about hygiene or cleanliness it was a ceremonial washing\nThey were not failing the practice cleanliness they were failing to follow a tradition of ceremony Italy reducing their hands before they ate\nPlease no end versus three and four of attacks that it says the disciples were not in violation of the law they were in violation of the tradition of The Elders\nNow the tradition of the others has this background according to the fair sees when God gave the written law of Moses on Mount Sinai he also gave an oral law of Moses now there's no record of that in the Bible\nThere's no evidence that I'd ever happen but the ferret sees and The Elders had recorded the oral law God supposedly given to Moses and it was memorialized at the end of the second century a D in what is now referred to as the mission\nSecond century a D in what is now referred to as the mission or for instance the law says you should remember the Sabbath and keep it holy well that was enough for the\nElders in the first thing they had to add some details so you would know what that meant\nAnd so over the years the oral law supposedly on the same ground of authority as the written law began to grow and grow into absurdity if you want to know the truth spray\nNow the oral tradition was supposed to help one understand how to apply the law impractical every day matters\nBut what happened was the oral law or the tradition of The Elders became such a priority that it actually shifted the focus from the intent of the law to a growing number of external things that really did not represent the law at all\nSo the visitors from Jerusalem we're finding fault they were say that the followers of Jesus we're not living up to the traditions of The Elders the accusation\nBay profits complain to Jesus and the accusation resulted in a confrontation\nAnd be confrontation as recorded and versus six through nine read it in your Bible it says I refer mind Jesus answered ad and said to them well did I say a ... view\nHypocrites as it is written ... people\nHonors me with their lips but their heart is far from me\nAnd in Maine they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men for lay aside the commandment of God you hold the tradition of men the washing of pictures and cups and many other such things you do he said to them all\nToo well you reject the commandment of God but you may keep your own\nTraditions Jesus\nBegins his confrontation with the seas by quoting I'd say at twenty nine Thirteen nothing could have described the conduct of these feral sees any better than the words of their own revered profit Isaiah\nUsing I say as words Jesus told the fair sees that they were not real\nHe told them that they were phoney use that they were hypocrites in today's language we would say they were posturing putting a spin on their lives they were ... they were acting out something that was not representing their heart\nUnclean most ... separation from God are all matters of the intentions of the heart not a violation of cultural rituals and formalities so that's what he said the motive\nAnd now he's going to you can get more specific so he moves away from the multitude and Seventeen we're told he goes into a house and when he had entered the house away from the crowd his disciples ask him concerning the parable so he said to them don't you get it yet\nIt how many Times She's had to say that to his disciples he must have been very discouraged me taught them as no man ever taught greatest teacher in the world and they didn't get it gives me great encouragement as I preach every week I Want you to know that [noise]\nIf they didn't hit Jesus I'm not gonna complain too much if you don't get me right [noise]\nBut he brought them into a house and he said to them or you dust without understanding also do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot file him because it does not after his heart but his stomach and it is eliminated and then there's this little phrase and I want you to underline the send your Bible\nIt says Jesus them by saying this is says the U.S purifying all foods that one little statement got Jesus nailed to the cross that you know that that one little statement declared war\nOn the fairest sees and they're superficial righteousness Jesus said in this new world in which we live there are no unclean foods\nAnd he said what comes out of a man that defines a man but from within this is where the problem is it's not washing your hands are utensils or your couches or all of this outward stuff that you're so overwhelmingly committed to its your heart's\nThat's the problem is that your heart not what you to read\nThis with because this is really a devastating list I Need to tell you if you could read this in the Greek language and I don't like to make that a big deal the Greek words for all of these things that are in this first are ugly words [laughter]\nI mean if you read and this is a dark passage I was going to bring all these words in and try to read them but I'm just going to tell you these are dark words listen to what he says\n... out of the heart of man proceed evil thoughts adult trees for negotiations murders fest covered dismiss wicked this deceit gluten is an evil lie blasphemy pride foolishness all these things come from within and to file a man now get this [laughter]\nThe ... are worried about whether they're pots and pans are clean and she says no that's not the problem my friend my friend is your heart and your heart's got a lot of problems by the way could I just tell you that Jesus believed in the total depravity of man\n[laughter] what would you say pastor I don't believe that where did that come from\nWhat the reason people don't believe in the totally private humanity because\nThat's where I don't believe that and where did that come from what the reason people don't believe in the totally private humanity because most of the time they think that means that every man is is evil is every man could be it's not true that's totally proudly is totally privacy isn't being as bad as you could be thank God for that\nBut totally private he means that in every part of every man's life evil resides\nBut every one of us have the disease of sin and it has affected us in every part of life if you just look at the list you will see has to do with sexual attitudes it has to do with pride and envy and has to deal with evil thoughts every part of every man has been affected\nBy the cancer of sin and we all have the disease ten is affected us and every part of our life whether we like it or not it's the truth\nJesus explains what happens to a man from the outside\nHas no effect on his heart that if a man is going to be clean he's got to be clean in his heart\nAnd I need to tell you you might as well have stabbed the fair sees with a knife but that was their problem they spent every minute worrying about the outward man and no time at all concerned about their hearts that's why they could cheat their parents out of\nThe legacy that should've been there's without even a thought because their hearts were evil and they were full of greed and pride and want to care for their own things remember eyes as words again you drawn to meet with your lips\nPut your arts far from me Jesus list third teens sins of the heart\nThe first seven are in plural devoting evil acts and the last six or in the singular devoting evil attitudes\nSend affects us we\nAll know it we don't like the knowledge and we're prone to try to put on a good fraud are we not we don't want that to be true but we know it's true we know in our heart a true and that's why we seek in our heart for something that can make us feel clean inside because we know we've been affected by the same disease\nThe Bible says for all have sinned income short of a gory of God\nRoman says there is no one righteous not even one we are all gone astray every one of us I'm not talking about you as opposed to me I'm Talking about us all let me tell you something we all have one thing in common we're all sinners we all inherited soon from Adam all the way through and we have a sin nature\nAnd there's nothing we can do about that from the outside they're just nothing we can do it we can't get into a reclamation program there is no ten twelve Fifteen twenty step program that can clean this up inwardly we can dress up the outside a little bit\nBut when we walk away we know that down in our heart something still wrong [noise]\nSo what does this all mean to us today this old passage from the book of mark I'd like to apply it in two ways if I can one principal applied in two ways first of all let's apply to ourselves who are followers of Christ\nSuppose you're already Christians what do these words mean to you [noise]\nWell I'm going to use a theological term but I Want you to understand the term I Want to say to you that scientific occasion is an inside out\nProcess scientific Haitian is for a Christian and it means becoming in practice what you already are imperfection the Bible says that in Jesus Christ you are clean and whole and righteous and scientific\nOccasion is the process of every day in your life becoming more and more like that in the way that you live how do I grow and holding us in righteousness and spirituality let me tell you can't do it from the outside and you got to do it from the inside out\nSo let me ask you a question today this is a hard one this is almost as hard as the question Jesus as the first days are you real\nArgue that you that people think you are I'm not\nTalking here about seamless perfection I Know better than that none of us are going to be there that we see Jesus someday I'm asking you about the integrity of your life I'm asking myself about the integrity of my life\n[noise] am I\nWhat everybody sees that I Am from the inside out\n\nI'm challenging all of us to stop living our lives from the outside in and begin living from the inside out quite worrying so much about what people think it began to care more about what\nGod thinks God sees are hard man sees are outside and here's our lips and win our hearts are right men and\nWomen when we deal with on confess in when we make things right with others that we have offended when we stopped doing in secret what we would never want anyone to know we are doing\nWe will be different people we will have a power and are Christian experience that we've never had when the reality of who we are and who we are posturing it'd be comes together in one my power a Holy Spirit movement the power he gets all on one back so and we go forward with strength\nBut one more posturing one over here where one way and over here where another way we lose all of our authority\nIn life where\nChristians outwardly but we're not enough Christians inwardly until we get real with our faith and quit playing the game and quick posturing and quit running around trying to think about what people expect of us instead of asking God when he wants from\nUs till we get real we can't make a difference in our culture so I Want to say to you come on man get real get real\nAnd if you're here today and you're not a Christian I Want to tell you some good news inserted into the bad news here it is\nIt is true that sank to vacation is an inside out process but it's also true that salvation isn't inside out process if you're here today and you know Jesus Christ one of the things that makes you uncomfortable about that is that you do stuff you wish you wouldn't do but\nIt's a fruitless task because you see it's not about the stuff that you're experiencing right now it's about word comes from and Jesus has told us that it comes from the garbage dump\nOf our heart and it's out of our heart all these things for seed and so if we don't fix our heart we can get better and so the question is this do you want to get better do you want to quit being unreal\nYou got to deal with your heart I Want to ask you to do that today\nThe Bible says if we open our hearts up and received Jesus Christ he will come and live within us and he will clean herself from the inside out the Bible says when we put our trust in him he takes away all of our sin that's the first step and he gives to us all of his righteousness\nTo take its place and we become clean and can't do that from the outside and you have to do that from the inside out to be Christian you need a new heart and I want to tell you a Jesus is in the new heart business he's got a new hard for you\nThat's pretty logical it and then if you're going to be married you ought to be committed wanting to the other whenever I married my wife I committed myself to her I told her that I don't want any otherwise I don't want to date anybody else I won't use for live this as it were were forever bound together according to God's word were married for life\nAnd I I Love that and I you know I Know that things happen to folks in it and everything and got no situations and that's that's not\nUp for me to say but I when I married my wife I married her for life I made a commitment said\nUntil death do us part there since the bond that I Want to have with you it would do no good for us to enter into that type of a vow to enter into that type of a promise we're not we're not wholeheartedly with just half of our heart involved in it\nIf I had four other girlfriends in a couple of other states and there I was in a church exchanging vows when my wife then you said I I was not fully committed to her\nIt would have made no sense but yet the folks in Iran hint business Christian walk and they have heartedly give their life to God and a half heartedly serve God\nAnd they want to hold things back from God and not allow him to be lord of their life\nAnd Jesus will not accept anything less than total commitment to him Jesus will not accept anything less than someone that it's completely consumed with doing his oil and living for him and dying for him and serving him geez I just want someone that is fully committed to him\nAt all times in all places in all things it is a radical\nWalk of life it is a complete separation from the world a complaint separation from San ... separation from self NSA wall pill of life and devotion to God and nothing else is acceptable and his side\nOnly fear the lord and serve him in Peru's widow oh your heart for consider how great things he's done for you all the things that Jesus has done where he's brought us from\nHow blessed us what are you gay for us his life he's very being he sacrificed for you and I so then we would not have to go to hell and be lost in return we love them not for what he can do for us because there are benefits the serving God\nNot for what Jesus can do for me not for what I can get or benefit from him\nBut because he loves to me first book calls he died for me because he gave everyone a thing for me I Love him and I want to serve him I Want to give them everything not because I can gain something from him but\nBecause he gay that British thing for me he laid down his life for me\nHe was fully committed to me before I ever knew anything about him hold on ...\nAnd the glory of Christ and him crucified before the foundations of the world he chose to lie for you and me even though I Would say yeah even though I Would not be wholehearted\nEven though I Would not take it seriously even though I Would fall he still gave us all for me because he loves me so completely\nHe loves to me so strong he loves me such tape ... tape that he was willing to give all for me and in return we must be willing to give for cries not for a vein Maury\nNot to be exalted not that we would receive anything in return but that price wouldn't be at a site that Bryce wouldn't be exalted then the kingdom of God would be advance that the will of God would be done in order to invest those\nThe Lord's Prayer that we probably all the time as a leader is not a temptation delivers from evil were dying is the king dome and the power\nAnd the glory for ever\nFind is the kingdom is the power\nIs still gory it takes all the but says all for days it all the cells all over you off of me and I put the emphasis on Christ where all glory on all honor is deserved praise and all glory is due to Christ and ham crucified\nI Want to read you something here the definition of the word devotion is love and loyalty or enthusiasm for something or someone is love loyalty and enthusiasm now again that that represents the example of gay marriage thing about a marriage with no loyalty\nYou know what that's going to be that's going to be a short marriage sank about a marriage with no love\nI Know folks that have been married a long time they don't seem like they love each other anymore but they endure but it's not a happy marriage is not a good union listen take about a marriage with no enthusiasm I I'm not\nReally happy to be married to my spouse anymore I just wake up and they're still here so I'll just go with the flow think about what a miserable union that would be thinking about what are you all full lifestyle that would be to be drawing when someone to take vows before God and not have love or loyalty or enthusiasm\nYet pei bulldog named the name of Christ they enter into this walk with God with no love for God no loyalty to God no enthusiasm for God\nNo loyalty to God no enthusiasm for God they're not devoted they have\nNo enthusiasm gap somebody already has said yeah sure him say where did you go to church well let them go to church anywhere well what do you do for God do you love the lord yeah sure whatever they have no enthusiasm for God\nWhen Jesus comes into the heart of a believer he put the fire about inside you he puts up inside you're not just for your fellow man but a love for him I\nHim this morning because he first loved to me I Love him because he died for me I'm a doozy asked about him because he changed my life\nAnd if he can do that for me then brothers and sisters he couldn't do that for you he can do that for the last world he can do that for the hungry he can do that for the sick he can do that for the mound\nHe can change alive today we have to serve him we love and loyalty and enthusiasm way are the body of Christ\nThe world is watching the world is taking them and tore they are judging God they're judging Christ by the example they see in his church\nAnd that's you and I my lord we've got a responsibility today to be committed to God he said how would that should be hot or cold but ... calls your lukewarm novels you out of my mouth we read that a moment ago\nPeople are committed to all kinds of things\nPeople are committed the crazy things I watch it all the time I'm not a sports fan I'm not ashamed of that I'm Sorry if you are I'm not a sports fan don't watch it don't listen to it don't protect Kennan do supported don't spend a dime of my money on it but folks or die hard for\nPeople running up and down the field in tight pants hugging all over each other armpit around on the field and they're making millions and millions and millions of dollars and some people are making minimum wage barely getting by Kay feed their family but they'll buy season tickets to go see that ... they are committed\nTo what they want to do they're committed to what fits terror lifestyle taught entertains them people go to great lengths to do things that world travelers and all kinds of things done mortgage their homes they'll sell everything they've got\nTo pursuing whatever events are in life they want to go on because they're committed to it a man is going to do what a man\nWon't do it that's how we're designed we are going to follow after this hard but if this hard is set on Christ we are going to follow Christ if this hard as they love what Jesus we are going to pursue Christ\nYou can always tell well man's heart is by what he supports about what it takes part in I listen to me\nListen our hobbies our interests are extra curricular activities they will tell own a believer they will always better witness to what is in the heart of man\nAbout what we give our money to buy what we support about what we can do own it will always tell the port committed to Jesus or not and I'm telling you\nThe world's going to be cut out of the heart of a man that follows after Christ there's not going to be any place in the heart of a believer for the worldly desires and attractions in Los\nAngeles and and the partying and all the things that take place in the world none of that's going to exist in the heart of a believer because the blood of Jesus sanctify is important to us from all sin\nImpurities and we follow after Christ and him crucified it's a way of mental it's not popular anymore\nBut it's going to absolutely require commitment in order for us to make you have in our home this morning we must be a ...
