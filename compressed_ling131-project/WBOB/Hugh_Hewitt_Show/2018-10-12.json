B. O. B. along with Roger Anderson\nSo let's get to it you think we are making this up Roger you think that this was a Saturday Night live skit and I understand there was a reason why behind it but Andrew Gillum has sent out a list again this is the Democratic mayor of Tallahassee who is leading in all the polls right now has sent out\nA cease and desist order to all television stations radio stations that if they run this ad by the way which we're going to play not in the promotion of or understand just bought that what's being talked about we're we're kind of safe from an air\nWould have taken place there was an ad that was being run during\nThe uh the storm of hurricane Michael and of course the aftermath and the clean up\nTo the given campaign sent a cease and desist letter to the Florida GOP of an attack ad during\nHurricane Michael it aired it said that a guild is being investigated by the FBI and they say that the ad is full of a you know lies and everything else out there ... it's it's a false and its numerous aspects here is the ad in what is being played clip number three [noise]\nAndrew ... who's running for governor and also\nBeyond the kind of criminal investigation\nInto possible for for the New York in Costa Rica confronting kind of happen there in the news in graves for those same blog selling corruption proud to be a little refuses to disclose\nJust radical okay so that is the ad they say that's full of miss leading information but doesn't every candidate complain about that Roger\nYeah they're always going to complain that you know this was you know full of a misleading lives except\nFor the honest we know he's complaining here is from the given campaign he says the fact quote\nThat the ad is being run in the midst of a devastating hurricane is reprehensible\nFolks I can tell you for years\nOf stories I've covered up people that were down in the polls that one where we did the aftermath and we do the analysis they want because rats running during a tropical storm the week of election in general are glued to the television and radio gosh brilliant and radio I seen as forever\nSo Andrew Gillum where did you hear this President Trump this week\nCriticize Gail I'm not listening on ... and ... and but listen to what the campaign of stand about their parents WFDD overland do yeah President Trump says Gillum is a horrible man he's bad\nIf you look at it to run to Santa she's doing fantastically well back in from the beginning he's great he's doing a fantastic job will be a great governor's opponent\nWho runs a place that has a lot of problems and I know it very well but it's got a lot of problems tremendous corruption [noise] tremendous crime [laughter] this is not what you want to run in Florida is opponents is horrible choice\nOkay that right there was what happened I think the night before hurricane Michael hit ... of the uh this past Wednesday and the panhandle data that was that was being a member he was in town dealing whatsoever\nSo Gillum was being interviewed by Chris Cuomo prime time and give them says that this was a just how dare the president do this\nRight before and listen to listen to the spent how they're the president do this right before hurricane Michael head\nI think what the President Trump did last night by attacking me attacking my today I don't think we'd ever seen a sitting president I'll go after a sitting mayor and a community that it can pay a preparing it though for a new category for hurricane right or to attack it listen we don't need partisanship we need a president we need a partner\nWe need someone who was going to come to our aid when we needed not throw the political shot\nOkay so the president didn't do anything about the hurricane just said it was just the night before the one night and like two days went before hurricane Michael ... the president said Gillum is bad and listen I understand well I listed I'll be totally honest your folks I understand why doesn't want those that do you think of being funny I mean maybe I Am\nIt's all of this is happening during hurricane Michael because everybody that has not been affected by the storm what do you live in Jacksonville bureau Beach Florida Orlando Daytona\nYou're still watching the news it still affects you because a lot of people from North west lord came to the east coast of Florida right so a lot of it so people are watching what's going to happen I understand why Gillum doesn't want this to be run\nI have another question yeah and you know just doing the cease and desist making all the noise about it that's going to bring a lot of attention to the ad anywhere and whether or not there are some strategy on the on the gallows campaigns part to get some free press got out of it is true\nBut the point is people want to look at the ad yeah who's in who's and by the way you can't be that's not that easy to find to try to go try to you too yeah I got a cause you know I have ways of getting all the things [noise]\nUm you can't really find the ad out there so the question is do you think it benefits Gillum or do they get benefits to say this outbreak\nWhy I don't know which was so hard to predict until after people start voting oil yeah polling data or I'm I'm thinking of this point the ad is out there probably ah you know just talking about it may make Gillum looked like a fighter and that made you know benefit him to some extent Fox\nNews correspondent Doug mckell way focus was on a story that President Trump said this past week that if the Democrats getting power it'll be socialism running around but\nHow popular is it when you do have those that may not use the word socialism but the advocate for ideas stemming from it clip number five\nAmericans election headquarters tonight there has been a lot of talk this election year about socialism candidates identifying with the concept concept that made big news in some races across the country of course from the ... looks at what's socialism is and how perception of it is evolving\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez may be the poster child of America's new love affair with socialism based on\nThe Democratic party saddled with the primary the truth and you're fourteen congressional district\nAnd there are others President Trump is leading Republican efforts to brand and to give them a socialist\nGillum is leading Republican Ron beset us in the Florida governor's race that real clear politics rates that it's a toss up\nAnd Bernie Sanders remains the movement supplied piper Beijing for single payer health care the president tying that to the midterms and the lead lead the Democratic party what his socialist infuses resurgent critics of Obamacare call it socialized medicine may consider its passage or watershed moment for many today's younger socialist\nWho came of age during the two thousand in a recession\nKnow you don't need there's a there's a story about up there how many businesses are started\nDuring the great depression maybe on buddy anyway I digress\nSo caring cabin all interesting name from Voyager investments as as litter explained it uses to listen to folks don't panic about this a lot of companies are looking at what the interest rates going up she says they're just looking at earnings out there they want to see what's going on right now some people will sell off because remember me focus me explain to\nIts earnings take a dip sodas your money per stock ... so a lot of people like we want to see the earnings report it mostly the earnings report or let's say hypothetically Sears was innocent prime threat Seventy five dollars for stock\nDuring his report comes out and says hey we didn't do as well as we did that may drop it down to sixty five bucks because there are selling off to make a buck exactly that's what Karen Kavanaugh says rising\nRate but it's a good economy so therefore we are going to have higher rates and investors are just going to have to get used to that I think they're just there right now they're just trying to digest how he's going to affect their earnings because at the end of the day it's always earnings that drives the markets\nAnd so we're right in between earning scenes and we're starting earnings season for quarter free and we're going to take that\nAnd I just wanted to see what the companies are going to be saying about how these higher rates are going to impact their earnings so that's why we see this ... this ... this part of the market where we're seeing a lot of unsettled a lot of investor panic selling out but it's really once he starts a sea earnings investors will settle down a bit\nWhen we see earning season play out I bet you they will have that confidence and they'll realize that the economy as good an earnings are good for this and this sell off here it's just a normal correction and higher rates higher and that's just par for the call\n... and folks there is a lot of people this was a fascinating debate\nYou know the Obama economy that we had artificial interest rates there were just as your folks I mean\nWe had an interest rate to zero ... in the economy was still barely moving out there wasn't moving yes moving at a quarter is just a pace we wanted to move kind of a rabbit but keep it going\nSo now with less quantitative easing Wall Street journal fascinating article on this yesterday ten years later\nBut now we're moving to more free market explain for those who don't know what is quantitative okay you want to do in layman's terms quantitative easing that's a glorified turn as we said pumps money into the economy\nTo get the ball rolling I could spend an hour how they buy up debt prior to pump priming the best right now if you look at it this way it's kinda like and I explained this years ago\nIt's kinda like you've been on drugs you and I both of you know we've lost weight whatever\nAnd let's say that you get off the drugs and you're going through a detox your body's going through pain\nIf you took a little shot of some of the drugs your body will be pain free correct\nFor short term right okay that's the government's pumping money the economy you want to flush the system out so your system can get back\nTo running on a on a healthy style based on the activity that you do okay jogging or walking you do not want to have a lifestyle that in other words the only way that you can get your morning do when it's taken some\nMonster drank are wondering what's the what's it was the caffeine drinks now let's see biz Red Bull read it all started with ... and that's what I'm saying so you want your body to be able to live up to to help you get your ... going right now through a bunch of artificial\nNutrition okay that's the kind of explain a little bit well OK\nMore as we continue to move along the campaigns again benefiting the Senate Republicans maintain the house that still debatable Mollie Hemingway from the federal is dot com says if you look at it people may sit back and go look at these candidates like Bill Nelson all but that he's a nice guy\nHemingway says yeah but if you look at candidates like Bill Nelson and other democratic candidates who are very polite by the way she says they're still going to vote in favor of they get control of Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer she says what happened with Brett Kavanaugh if those on the conservative I Want more conservative justices if the Democrats gain power to you can just act by\nWhich has to say you can like him on your wind but if you vote for him when you have a very narrowly contested overall Senate picture if you put him in office responsible for having Dianne Feinstein daycare and judges are responsible for Chuck Schumer running the show but I having a say in can like can\nYou know you can't vote for him and it's the opposite of what we saw from twenty sixteen when a lot of people maybe didn't like Donald Trump that they were happy to vote for anything it's and it's interesting that people think that might not last for Republican voters these are the same voters who managed to\nTake their concern about the Supreme Court and have it lasts for six eight months to vote for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen nearly care a great deal about the Supreme Court's I think they will have that energy we're being told that was going to be a blue wave and that everything was going to turn the fact that the fact that this close to election day we're saying quite a few shake ups and they said\nThey were going to see what happens I mean it it is a fascinating story when you look at the Supreme Court what what are you from the left or from the right and a lot of decisions are made their decisions from union the free speech by should Medicaid be paying for state run abortions and so many states right into the face of a ... totally correct\nDiscovers allied how how this is not a big issue\nIt is it is and it's very important to think about this in the very likeable people who do you want other people there that you like or people who make the right decisions for you in this country\nDemocrats are becoming more and much bolder after cabin also after two thousand sixteen about eliminating the electoral college it is laughable wait till you hear what is being said by Fox News Howard Kurtz from media buzz by the way who is going to cover the cost\nFor the Florida hurricane of hurricane Michael will you the taxpayer cover that costs are going to get more money from the ... and ...\nHurricane Michael will you the taxpayer cover

last several days you saw the down nearly fell almost Thirteen hundred points that are going to make somebody that I remember the markets are guaranteed to do two things are guaranteed to go up there are guaranteed to go down Fox Business news ... says hey there's nothing really surprising when you look at the history of the great recession black\nFriday and Nineteen or black Monday in Nineteen eighty seven when you look at the great depression and she says October is notorious for just having a horrible month when it comes to the stock market's\nHe's forty eight hours supporting the data that October in about a month and standout certainly and market lure October Nineteen twenty nine black Tuesday the market fell in Ninety eight percent and the great depression followed Nineteen eighty seven had black Monday at twenty two percent drop in one day\nThe financial crisis of two thousand eight began technically in late September but it really continue to full force through October and then technically through march for the past Fifteen Years October has lived the highest share and daily moves at either one percent or more in either direction on ESPN pay five hundred\nAnd now there is that the U.S government's fiscal year begins on October first\nAnd that influences big industry contracts and clans other say\nSo what is taking place folks is that if the earnings come out and they're not as good as what they see they said you have a stock a for a certain company at Seventy bucks to share and you don't think the earnings are going to be that good their earnings to drop down the sixty five well guess what why would you sell the sixty five because ... that's what's going on it was pretty much taken place and\nHappening a from a boy or investment carrying cabinet told

triple to eight to five five is this fair game\nIs it fair game to attack him Mm I'd be careful I may be asking you a trick question is it fair game mass another question why Italian Gillum if he's not the target but people around him on a target of an FBI investigation\nAnd he again just a very simple questions that criticism it's a question why are they attack and kill 'em on his views the minimum wage\nTaxes being increase maybe have to go down the road of having an income tax to pay for all of us how can those ads are running is it fair game to be attacking Gillum on people surrounding him up and down the identification Roger I think\nThat does the Republican Party of Florida is probably going to go with whatever sticks whatever works they probably don't care which fair they want to get around the same as selective and uh you know I think through a lot of these things\nAnd uh you know may be you know those around him were involved with some things he said emphatically bit heated know anything that was going on right now the FBI is told him he wasn't the target right although the he and he's cooperating with them\nOkay so my question to you and I'm going to take your calls right now at nine zero for triple to talk ... triple to eight to five five is this fair game\nTo sit back and attack them or him and his buddies or target I mean he originally was targeted by the FBI but he's no longer talking now I mean I mean that's true but is it fair game to go after him on that or should we be focusing quote on the\nIssues he's and by the way is is\nI mean what if you have this and every campaign libel and slander I mean you might have lawsuits throughout the throughout all the campaigns\nYeah but that may be some ...\nLet's go to Lawrence Lawrence good morning you're on WB obey\nLawn and go hey good morning great man\nYeah um well you know are you going to see all this weird campaign stuff going on as a warning about the long time ago there's always a kernel of truth and everything\nI'm you know and and they just exaggerate a little bit off it's I I don't know what's going on with you all American thing I'm I'm I'm sure it'll come out in the wash but um I had a I had a point on what we saw socialism and and that fabulous and then all of that I notice\nThat all these young people want to have open borders and everything but if you try to get into a communist socialist country there are new overboard\nAnd that's right yeah but\nYou know I I don't understand how they embrace certain things and don't like you say they really don't understand them\nBut ... but but Lawrence let me ask you the question I've always stayed away from calling the people the names I mean you can sit back and say\nHey President Trump wants to adopt policies from\n... and I'm not saying he as I'm saying if you want to make the Oregon instead of calling him a racist I mean okay fine you could come out and say hey you know he has people on his campaign has views of white nationalist okayed you explained it that way I think wonder because the left always will call concert was like you Lawrence\nHey a a sell out your call you a Nazi and they have no clue what it's about I think I Wonder if if conservatives throw that name out your socialist you're communist because they don't want to properly identify the issues from what that candidate may be positioning themselves on\nYou know that that's right I mean I've been called everything under the sun I stopped you know worrying about that years ago I look at it as just ignorance on their part of the you know we want to have a discussion that's fine if you don't want to do that will just agree to disagree\nAbout Lawrence as a black Republican when you campaign against Korean brand I use that just before you know she's a she's a black social you'd never said that use today she's wrong for do Walsh easily overlook interviews you did I think a lot of their color a bunch of names Asia\nYeah it had nothing to do with race or anything just a matter of I just didn't agree with our policy\nRight now so anyway that hey you know what to bad she's not running for office you the best chant would be lock her up oh yeah that's why the lord of the ... ... talk tripled to eight to five ...\nTo run to Santa she's doing fantastically well backed him from the beginning he's great he's doing a fantastic job will be a great governor's opponent\nWho runs a place that has a lot of problems and I know it very well but it's got a lot of problems tremendous corruption [noise] tremendous crime [noise] this is not what you want to run Florida is opponents as horrible choice\nIs what you know why that you could put you don't see that today you don't have that today you are an anchor actually asked a reporter out in\nThe field so what do you think is going on out there\nYou see now my day if you if an anchor were to ask that question or Puerto Rico I don't really think I Know I see I have learned to do this they would never expressed say well this is what I think kind of thing because that's expressing an opinion\nAlright alright I don't pay for our premiums\nBy the way Bill Carter former CNN News corresponded former Rob the news director for first coast news out of the Jack ...\nManaging editor okay well I was going to get that in a moment but anyway no oh what's the difference between the managing in the news I mean you didn't you were you both titles\nA no no I was the news director at another stage to manage to get an idea\nI was going to get to that but it it just all around good guy we do a lot of luck tonight coverage together last few years he uh we're talking with him\nRight now about the media coverage on the gubernatorial race some people are like where's wrong I'd been Gillum is out there trying to probe Trump under the bus all of the other I mean it it is if a candidate cannot get its message out\nIn let's say that a candidate from the Republican side a Democrat I mean it's just too easy to blame the media for somebody's loss\nNo uh no the the media the media actually directs people into a train of thought if the media is siding with a particular candidate or their siding with a particular issue\nThe public for some reason you know falls back on the old days at least the old timers do and they think well they're they're they're basing this on fact they're not basing this on opinion they're basing this on fact people hear news and they think what they are getting our facts not opinions\nSo no no uh the the the ... the media really does drive the bus to a certain degree\nBut fortunately these days at the same time you've got someone like Trump who if you say something that he doesn't agree with she'll get on Twitter or whatever and you know if Reagan could have done that in his time people yeah because he used to take his stuff\nHis ideas his direction directly to the people die or if Congress was going he would take it to the people in the national dress well these days and and you've seen this with Trump and we've seen it with Bush didn't see it as much with Obama\nBut the national media would decide not to actually air a presidential address\nHe's been great for the ratings I mean for all I mean even the numbers digitally the Washington Post and a a New York times are gone up and let me get to another big news story we are covering today I Andrew Gillum has sent a cease and desist order\nTV stations around Florida because an ad is being run by the Republican Party of Florida on behalf around the Santa is being run ... understand why he wants it off your bill because it's being run during the\nCoverage of the hurricane in the aftermath after hurricane Michael everybody's watching it with the ad they claim is falsely stated about Gillum is the subject of an FBI investigation who listen to this ad on what your take on this in a moment\nAndrew ... who's running for governor and also\nThe time criminal them to root for the New York in Costa Rica confronting kind of happen there have been ... for those same law corruption crowd found disclose All right\nSo I don't know if it's the strongest ad but having said that he says that this is he's telling stations is liable and its slander and as a matter of ethics quote it needs to be pulled you got a cease and desist order is a managing director of the managing editor what\nWould you would have done um the courts have no control over what our air as a news director\nOr ... or ... I mean\nUh you know a ... ... our ability to speak\nOur ability to speak our ability to report the news our ability to air sayings uh is is based on the constitution it's not based on election process it ... it for for better or for worse\nOr whether the ad is correct or not it is it is not the court that has the ability to tell a television station or broadcast it at the newspaper that supposedly has real journals that are\nThat they can all hot air a commercial uh they cannot express an opinion that cannot hear a story\nNailed it down Bill Carter former CNN News corresponding former managing a director news made it I knew about the news director but former managing editor for first coast news out of ... and all throughout the state of Florida bill good have you on\nAlways a pleasure at\nNight but yet but here's the key thing that we've seen me doesn't stop you from having a threat of a lawsuit and lawsuits do costs company's money\nI don't know if this would hold the water though because of the uh the TV stays on the radio to their their government is saying they were ... green them if they're asked\nTo agree but stations alone they don't want to deal with all sorts of stuff that's my point I was getting that more as we continue to move along\nTriple to talk tripled to eight to five five fair game is Andrew Gillum writes libel slander game to talk about the investigation FBI or is this not the real issue in the Florida governor's race tripled to talk lines of report triple do eight to five five talk radio WB obey\nBut you know these are north done an avid to look out

Tallahassee is is not a great combination but he says on Sundays and God we trust when the power's off in glock we trust so that's pretty good\nYour calls coming up next Niger report tripled you talked the ad is being run out there by the Republican Party of Florida talking about an FBI investigation nature guild says here's a libel slender it's misleading I Know why he doesn't want to run because there's a lot of hurricane coverage going on and people do ratings do grow up your eye when people watch hurricanes and the disaster in the following\nBut the things that you have a point should we be able to sue people that have been lied about is in the campaign I Want to ask you about that or is it fair game number two\nWhat do you think about the ads being run by the disadvantages or the Republican Party of Florida on behalf of rather than just about going after Gillum on being spit has been a target at the FBI is it fair game I Want to do you think\nOr should it be talking about the issues tripled you talk nine zero poor triple do a do five by this is talk radio W. B. O. B. [noise]\nCities repealing stand your ground I Do yes he wants to impeach Trump that Santa suit running a ... ... ...\nIt will not run any attack that they can check against uh against Kilpatrick who cares about what his response was to a hurricane two years ago in Tallahassee yeah he does\nHe also right that this has also read\nAnother ad about how he played little league baseball back in Nineteen Ninety One who cares about that you don't get it as it's not you know and go home and said he probably will it's because they're saying it's Red Bull campaign have a good day care at\nAll right Bob was I was just gonna ask Paul I'm he might want to give his number I think people might want higher and run the campaign there were other campaign he\nYou know another thing to an\n... hold on let me interrupt you he nailed it no I'm not saying you have to put you got to the heat nail it he knew the issues he nailed it and I think a lot of people may resonate with what he\nSays it's fair to blame those are the candidates because essentially you've got the salt and numerous tend to be going on simultaneously also the same guy\nThe Republican Party of Florida running these car that has nothing to do with necessarily but 'cause the Sanders campaign management they're running that's separate from here you have all these super PACs hung up their data public a little bit of James\nThat but I'm just saying is is I think ... people dream Paul I mean nobody listen now I've said before I think nobody cares about my opinion we just lay out the facts as European your little league baseball\nI think nobody cares about my opinion we just lay out the facts about European\nYour little league baseball thing he wanted to I Believe resonate with people that he was the Florida guy and not somebody out of Washington DC\nI I agree it took to the heart strings you know Rick Scott hanging out ... grand kids that looks great but the bottom line is it's about issues and they're asking is it three is if he thinks that the folks there is a conservative think things are race has already done with\nIt makes the race has already done with the guys this answers as late as the game they say let's go to James James good morning you're on WB you'll be what do you think James\nYeah get great objectivity today guys a look at as far as as far as what I say I don't think the racist no it's not over but ... what I wanted to comment on is is I'm Democrat socialist agenda that they keep pushing you know I mean to me it Democrat push that agenda is like\nA candlelight when you bought a used car when you were young and thinking it was a Lamborghini but after three years to turn out to be a Ford Pinto you know total lemon\nEditor broke down on yet and and the reason why I'm bringing us I mean ... where you gotta you gotta watch what you wish for the European model that they that they love to cherish so much\nTo people in this country realized that when you buy a vehicle and Europe your\nTax about forty percent ... percent lawyers on all the sale of that vehicle do they realize\nThat a Europe let's say I'm Talking about Paul and hungry these are well known countries Austria Germany you know places like that um you didn't realize that your income tax your your your income taxes you're taxed about forty to fifty percent\nI mean there's a reason why the New York times best seller is not you know is America ready for socialism so I don't know what Bernie Sanders supporters where they got their information from but what do you guys you guys think America will be ready for it you\nKnow you you've got to ease people and for all this\nAnd you bring up an interesting point I mean you kind of alluded to it but it's I've always been fascinated that when you bring up other countries the Fabian socialist out of a Europe you've got Venezuela the systems that those are the last one to employ here they haven't worked over there\nThey can't tell you what are they all Toyota's throwing the great but Cuba's just awesome that's what they all say right but they can't given effects\nBut if you ask them okay been why is there's so much debt over there why is it that I I mean they have to look at austerity you know about you know cut government spending to buy into that but they've got to look and getting their act in control there but it's not really property and reading\nTheir attitude in says well we could do it better over here it's like coach gave me the ball I can give me the ball I can run with it I can see this guy I Know I can score\nI understand that attitude but that's the mentality they think well it hasn't run property over there but we get all that much more\nOkay fine let me ask you a question ... me have you on the on the conservative I'll always wanted to use a foreign country let me bring in here domestically give me a government run program health care wise that you would adopt as a model that you'd be deployed and for all other Americans gave me one you know you\nCan't even those that listening to show a lot of veterans listen to the show and we love our veterans\nAnd we don't say that to patronize and we do\nThey'll even tell you man that the VA we ... we don't want that system for everybody else exactly so you mean like a lot of it but when it comes to the overall the VA folks we're not we're not colonel walls who's running for Congress in the congressional district six against Nancy Soderberg he'll tell you they I mean he's a colonel folks because I don't want to be assessed upper body else\nSo just give me a for all the on the left just give me a government run health care program that you think in this country has done is done pretty well do you think should be applied to everybody else tripled to talk

Nineteen\nTo contact the damn snakes on a one on one called two two two\nTo five ... ... email to sit\nBack and joined the you know the hours we go every morning from six to nine right here on TALK radio WB it'll be a dean here along with Roger Anderson hanging out in the studios\nAre old friend it's good to have him here came over from Chicago had images in business with immigrants council dot com or a good friend financial in economics radio Steve ... senior year of morning at what a pleasure to be down here in the ... floor that's right so let's let's get to the news um the Supreme Court to big decision\nA story I Want to bring you shows the hypocrisy from the lap according to a news report from Yahoo Democrats agree took it for more of President Trump's judicial nominees but it's not a little record it's only on a federal court not the Supreme Court and Democrats agree to expedite boats on Fifteen of President Trump's nominees to a lifetime federal courts\nThey did a quick Roger and Steve because they want to get going for campaign reasons\nNormally the Senate requires are about up to thirty hours of waiting time for each nominees but the Democrats said\nWell because of a danger Democrats up for reelection let's just get it all done with by the way they solve this happened in August\nI see what this kind of shows is wait a second they were ready to go in a campaign mode when it came to Brett Kavanaugh but they're not willing to do it for the less but of course because it's not a sexy is enough I guess well I think also the Democrats learned that going against Kavanaugh like they did energize the Republican base and if you go against these lower court nominees it's going to be a front and center on the campaign front\nThe reality is America is still a center right country in most ways and the local levels\nIt's the reason they're fighting against the electoral college and that but we have so politicized the Supreme Court\nThat overlapped wants to come out so they pander to it but in these local federal elections and ended to says local I mean it's a national position but a federal judge election is going to affect voters in that community which I Want to get into Mollie Hemingway senior editor from the federal says it looks like in two thousand in Eighteen wasn't two thousand sixteen\nThe Supreme Court could be a deciding factor for voting we should\nSay you can like come on your wind but if you vote for him when you have a very narrowly contested overall picture if you put him in office he when he responsible for having Dianne Feinstein to care and judges he the responsible for Chuck Schumer running the show but I guess I can like can\nYou know you can't vote for and it's the opposite but we saw from twenty sixteen when a lot of people maybe didn't like Donald Trump that they were happy to vote for him to think it's interesting that people think that might not laugh for Republican voters needed a same voters who managed to\nTake their concern about the Supreme Court and how that lasts for six to eight months I couldn't vote for Donald Trump twenty sixteen nearly care a great deal about the Supreme Court it's I think they will have that energy [laughter] we're being told that was going to be a blue wave and that everything was going to turn the fact that it's not that close to election day we're saying quite a few shake up the nature has\nYou know I get what's interesting is is that you know Raj and I were talking about this earlier I mean a lot of times of course it and not just on social issues about an economic issues whether it's another suit against Obamacare which is being talked about how when it comes to the freedom of speech when it comes to a union costs what'd you cover a lot on your radio show as well\nBut this is also that the Supreme Court can sit back and say we don't want to hear these cases will at the lower federal courts decide which is just as important which shows the ... because the Dems again they got to go on campaign so let's rush these guys through but yet when it comes to cabinet all they\nWant to make political head about it I get it we know Kavanaugh was a show right but what happened is a blow up on 'em because Dianne Feinstein looked like a complete idiot you go through the entire democratic wind up they just came in as pure obstruction us\nAnd I think it was a sham I think it was a shame for the American people I don't I think people saw through it I I think they understand that this is pure hypocrisy and it's a political process that's gone completely out of control they talk about civility on one hand but they come back and they show anything but civility against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think it's going to backfire on him so that suppose a blue wave is going to turn red and if you look at Trump's audiences that would certainly indicate that Democrat candidate for governor Andrew Gillum this has been a big news story over the last couple of days he is sending out a cease and desist letter that means stopped running the ad for so maybe that may not be known about that\nHe sent it to the television stations by the way we're going to play the out here in a moment\nThat uh that was a an attack ad on behalf of dissent just from the Republican Party of Florida\nThey said in the in the ad that are in Gillum as being the target of an investigation or people around them are targets of investigation by the FBI the gimmick campaign says that they may sue they said that the actually be pulled as a matter of ethics but on top of that Roger it's just like\nThey say that the actually be pulled as a matter of ethics but on top of that Roger ... just libel and slander here is the ad that is running\nAndrew ... who's running for governor and also\nThe villains criminal investigation to look for New York in Costa Rica confronting kind of happen there either give them credit for those same law is selling corruption crowd\nRefuses to disclose\nOur allies are talking about the end the moment which I think you could probably hit them on other issues he said this quote\nHe said for this to be running during the midst of a storm in the aftermath is a he says he just absolute wrong it's reprehensible that there were people that watch TV especially during the tragedy of a hurricane the aftermath that's he doesn't want this running buddies telling people hey listen we're going to see you if you keep running this ad\nI don't see the link between that and the hurricane number one yeah but I get a kick out of Florida when I come out of Illinois politics they think that dirty politics I mean give me a break\nThat was an ad that points out a legitimate investigation that has nothing to do with the hurricane and I think voters need to know if a person they're voting for has corruption embedded in their soul here President Trump was in Florida this past week this is what he said about Andrew Gillum on WFDD out of Atlanta looking\nTo run to Santa she's doing fantastically well back in from the beginning he's great he's doing a fantastic job it'd be a great governor's opponent\nWho runs a place that has a lot of problems and I know it very well but it's got a lot of problems tremendous corruption [noise] tremendous crime does not what you want to run Florida is opponents as horrible choice\nYou know here's the question I understand it is fair game but with Gillum who do support the Alexandria ... Cortez type or NSA Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage Medicaid expansion Medicare for all free college tuition he call himself quote the most progressive guy and the Democrat race\nIt wouldn't be much more some simpler if you're going to go after him to talk about the issues instead of whether or not friends around him or in the direction of a target from the FBI you you know you\nBring up I think what does a great point we had that same issue in Illinois when Joe Walsh ran against Tammy Duckworth because instead of Joe Walsh coming out against her policies he came out against some criminal investigations that had happened against er and actually blew up on them\nHere on the top stories were bringing you this morning with the devastation following hurricane micro this past week in Florida one of the next big questions is who's going to cover all the costs\nOn Social Security will see an increase in their checks and twenty Nineteen and the Andrew Gillum campaign sends a cease and desist letter against the Republican Party of Florida on an attack ad\nContact the ed dean\nShow on AM six hundred and one on one of them were going to to to talk for two to three to five or email in Reno\nSocialism comes into flavor saw one flavors when all the means of production and all the companies the factories the hospitals are actually owned by the government and run by the government and then the second flavor they owned by a private individuals but they're heavily regulated and essentially managed by the government\nTwenty minutes after the our good morning at dean Roger ... studios with us very well known book author and financial aid and economics radio talk show hosts that he is the what the ... council\nDot com yesterday we talked about you know the guilt got this Medicaid expansion and that there was that we kind of nailed it one of the reasons why that\nWe have Democrats and listen to show and they go you know had my son or daughter for health reasons don't seem to get the proper attention and now you want to expand which means they're not going to get the real attention they need\nBut I understand that was one of the understand but the example for costs but you know the just recently President Trump let me play this clip because technically he's correct when he says that if you want to go after and look what the Democrats want this is going to be clipped number twelve he says that with their Medicare for all\nHe says that they would actually uh when you look at it this would end\nWhat we see right now when it comes to ah what I have that clip to adequate guys is that the uh the Medicare I'm\nRight here clip number twelve old\nSaying goes all politics is local President Trump is trying to nationalize\nHouse and Senate races saying the policies that he has implemented or intends to implement are\nOn the line with the latest salvo against Democrats targeting their push for Medicare for all the u._s._a. today op ed the president writing the Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits there were promise\nKnow technically he's correct if you were to go with the Medicare for all you would and medicate and just give you the current Medicare\n... you know where I stand on this is the reason Medicare has worked as we've promised people roughly a hundred trillion dollars of benefits we can't pay right so it's a Ponzi scheme of the worst sort if you extend this out to everybody the entire system will collapse you can't taxed enough to do that\nThe problem is we've extended life expectancy in this country from sixty five to eighty five\nThat gap which came up since Nineteen forties\nSixty five to eighty five that gap which came up since Nineteen forties is creating a situation in which we're trying to pay people for a system designed fifty years ago but pay benefits in today's world it doesn't work so\nSeeing those all politics is local yeah\nBut yet we we hear about it I don't hear conservative listen I Do think the Republicans can't seem to talk about the economy they only did it only by the way both parties don't even talk about about Obamacare no but it helped you and that's\nWhere I'm Talking about why Trump got elected to begin with the American people want truth they weren't real talk\nWe have a problem with Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid it's consuming the federal budget\nWould then something on the order of Twenty years it will be the ball that I mean Seventy percent of the federal budget were squeezing out the ability to pay for military expenditures were squeezing out roads were squeezing out everything except Medicare Medicaid and social scale and\nHere's a one of the reasons why it's causing so much a a good liberal commentator Melissa Harris Perry\nMany comedy because it's a presentation of meritocracy people who work hard and sacrifice and save their money and make major contribution should earn a little more and they should they should have more resources the last time we also how however have to have worked\nUnder which nobody fall below that especially if you're a child you're below that we're not going to accept that you do have the right to health care and education and to decent housing and to quality food at all the time you make\nDo so right now you've got to pay for this right is that a lot that's all privilege by the way that is a frightening commentary because again you throw that worked for the last one she threw in there was food yeah right right so let's start regulating the food companies so they have to give away the food\nYeah tripled you taught nine zero for tripled to eight to five five Ron good morning you're on WB it'll be\nDuring the day I said earlier on the wrong thing to get one that you and and the discussion about those people are out there\nIn areas that you're not seeing Ron Ron my problem with that is still out there are

people out there\nAnd the new one on the Republican side pilot hearing it you got a website you go to it here it's just frustrating we're well we're out there and we were there those are volunteers\n... about a hundred years it's still for the Gillum campaign that's the whole point\nOf great but we're complain about it but if any of the air go do it\nYou know I was talking um I I was talking with Karen morning yesterday and and some other people from from the geo pay\nAnd they talk about all the new people\nThat are showing up no that's great my question is is when you go to a church what about the existing people that I mean everybody will show up to a free food it's a free speaker showing up for it comes to knocking on doors I mean I mean that's what you got new people but why is that you would get really a new people why can't you can't hold on to the existing clientele\nThat problem I I thought that was about Republican locally and there there was a kid\nYou know it was crying Quinn granted when they call a person that would have been ... or for ill so we don't let it go get out there and help\nA group have a good weekend triple do talk triple do eight to five
