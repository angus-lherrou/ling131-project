John now but as a Saturn Erie county's involve\nExactly yeah and a lot of people are getting out to the polls this year early they don't want to stand in line\nYeah well some of them already are standing in line or especially in South Florida and we're going to get to all those numbers Republicans think that they're doing pretty good the numbers may be a little bit different as up later today\nHybrid buddy ... dean here along with Roger Anderson let's get to synagogue shooting leaves tended over on Saturday Robert powers faces twenty nine federal charges some which are punishable by death\nLoving chance of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple accounts of hate crimes obstruction of exercise their religious beliefs resulting in death kind of thing out some of these laws are described\nAs four weeks before the shooting Bowers targeted Jews and frequent post on social media platforms and also a use anti Semitic slurs complained that President Trump was surrounded by too many Jewish people he ...\nHis family his in laws are Jewish come out with his son in law yeah you can't blame the Jews for the migrants caravans in Central America despite the less effort to blame this on Trump according to Washington Times the shooter was somewhat critical of the president\nThe federals reports isn't it ironic that the same liberals who want to blame Trump for all of this nonsense especially with the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nRecently fought to prop up the world's most powerful Jew hating terror state lecturing on the importance of combating anti Semitism let's get to the clubs Howard Kurtz from Fox media the media buzz again the laughter Democrats trying to blame Trump\n\nOK yeah is that you got it on your critics are saying the president and he'll be gone beyond partisan political competence outright demagoguery against racial minorities foreigners and prominent Jewish political figures in my heart absolutely\nBreaks for this tightening the Jewish community in Pittsburgh where this hateful shooting took place in a place of worship the shooter had a history of anti Semitic social postings are again you know allowed ta ram rave\nBut as far as President Trump I mean there were many mass shootings one block Obama was president including the tragedy of the nine African Americans killed in that South Carolina church so from the press perspective it's not like the violence began with the Trump administration's\nAdrian al rod former director of communications for the Clinton campaign says despite what that may have been true still a lot of this rhetoric in violence who's to blame but the the President Trump\nOn there and go on line for a long time before I signed on going out for a long time that there is an airline threat to the pipe bomb ... today and I hope the president and do a lot of faith when Garland for political party however\nSponsor belly everything here she'll bring this country we got her and not for Africa won't try it\nAgain the media is not saying that from President Trump but Sarah Fisher from Axios dot com she's a media reporter she says everybody keeps blaming Trump but yet again looking up all the criticism we've seen where he got Johnny Depp and Madonna joking around almost want to bomb and blow up the White House and assassination\nBut then again when you got the media out they're calling Trump Hitler Nazi wants to and those are the black race wants to and other those out there as well Sara Fisher says the media sometimes has\nTo take responsibility of what are your reports\nScientists are ... the ... a gallon from how\nBut in fact is not what caused the particular he was talking before about an hour and they need\nTo understand why some supporters here when it comes from ... and the truth is like that by the way which makes them feel that way I could account earlier this year I found out prowling channeling twelve have lost their job preparing to political queens that we're taking one side or not there are a lot on how to do it by the way\nThe median going overboard about their ... throws half a cup accountability for ... living in an environment where it can be difficult\nSo I guess what they're saying is that if you want to go after one side well which is below ... system to go out for both sides\nOf the media you know ... that would be the computer's good things to do and I always feel a little bit ... a weird because when someone in their own private time on a private account says something could lose their job over it which are typically has nothing to do with the ... are held was responsible for those things\nBut when you look at it a ... it's it's kinda like some of the consistency you know the media and the dams blame Trump rhetoric for the attempted violence of Caesar so yeah that's the guy who now has been the crazy guy I'm by the wall you fall sly people out there and you're listening\nAnd the the pictures on the van had been around for a long time they just won't be released claiming that the the the pictures of CNN sucks and and President Trump they act like oh it's too clean believe it was just it was just it was\nIt was planted no gave it up there for some time he was a delivery driver according to the people who work with anyway\nSo this is this is the question I'd like to ask you this is all blamed just on rhetoric in rhetoric only now that's where I Want to preface this Ross okay\nEven blame on rhetoric\nAnd rhetoric only\nCesar ... is now again he's not the problem ... he was a supporter of President Trump ... so Trump's criticism of the media and a Democrat is the ... that's what we're told now is the reason why ... Sundays mail packages whatever okay so let's see we go down that path\nThen what about shooters do mass shootings like you saw this guy over the weekend\nThat absolutely had nothing to do with the and our hey the n._r._a. doesn't talk about any type of political rhetoric I mean there are nonpartisan right there are some Democrats out there exactly but yet if this is based on political rhetoric why they always play for you that you feel when I ... is that if there\nThat is a very question something I had not considered but yeah\nOh he's playing for a few things going on ... is that if there is that is a very question something I have not considered but yeah the n._r._a. typically gets blamed for every shooting none of these mass\nShooters forever members of the n._r._a.\nMay I also go back to thousands sixteen Michael Johnson shot and killed I posted all this on the Facebook over the weekend shot and killed five Dallas police officers ... member that you have to probably protests led by black lives matter\nThe ... he was also a fan of the new Black Panther party and the nation of Islam by the way President Obama\nPresident Obama defended black lives matter member this guy went on the shootings were thought the black lives matter of getting a raw deal the protests that happened during the shooting was put on by black lives matter out there right ... the new Black Panther advocates violence against blacks ... advocates against those eradicating Jewish out there\nWith fifty four percent of likely voters ready to get favorably Democrats are spending millions in ads to make that point of polling data on Obamacare has also moved many Republicans to the left\nMy job I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre existing conditions\nIn August President Trump signed an executive order permitting short term plans which Obama Care for it as a way to cover pre existing conditions for this month's Senate Democrats tried but failed to overturn the matter who gained control of Congress in November the debate over Obamacare may intensified\nProof of that old Washington adage that it is easier to give them to take away ah but\nInteresting Republicans who oppose Obamacare mandates now supported here's the latest commercial by governor Rick Scott says he supports forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing conditions\nI Want to tell you about a family with increased health condition I grew up in public housing rarely saw Dr King had it to the ... mile charity hospital and getting treatment\nThat wasn't my family growing I support foreseen insurance companies to cover the conditions\nAh did you hear that yeah let me play a little more time\nI support foreseen insurance companies to cover the condition of it's just another political issue\nFor me personally toilet\nSo for senator Nelson it's just a political issue but what what what do you say for who I hold a woman that what did he say whether\nIt's just another political issue\nFor me personally it's personal for\nHim it's personal right now I like to ask a question if Obamacare was so bad and it needed to be totally revamped repeal and replace it always been curious what the replacement as\nBenefit needs to be repealed would you not also repeal the area of pre existing conditions out there now the Republicans are books this is probably if I'm not mistaken individual mandate this is probably what number one number two reason why that they want to do it because of a pre existing conditions so I think\nIt's really encourage you to know that uh that that the politicians regardless of their political affiliation are responding to the will of the people must be a pre existing conditions mandates\nIs kind of baked in ... as a as a phrase we've used already but I Do find it interesting that the group that came up with the idea of the individual mandate and um that the Heritage Foundation back in Nineteen Ninety three as bad as a Republican group that was a member of a ... who is is that Newt Gingrich was a member of it that one of the key leaders and now you have Republican\nAnd they were wrong I mean on the theory is correct it at once it's like a group health insurance plan everybody plays into it it becomes much ... you ... the costs become much more sustainable\nYou think there's any truth to the accusation that a big part of people wanting Obama appear to be repealed and replaced which is that they wanted to deny him the legacy for political reasons\nI don't know I mean it it says but but here's the problem now they're supporting us like this and I know governor Rick Scott out there they want to get elected that's right and I use the poll numbers out there so he wants to get elected on this issue President Obama was on the campaign trail again saying Republicans\nThere's a lot about everything but I make up everything out there you do a good job on\nHave exaggerated\nDidn't work out [noise]\nBut what we have not seen before [noise]\nOur reasons public lively [noise]\nPoliticians just blatantly\nWe haven't seen that before [laughter] what's he talking I Am not a crook [laughter]\nI I Am not a crook right oh my word Hillary Clinton are you ready for this year was asked um where are you gonna run again she says now but then again I might do listen to what she said she says our country is so confusing\nAnd I might do listen to what she says she says our country is so confusing to other countries have no clue about us which could be kind of good but she says because of you people voting for Trump you made this country confused\n[noise] hunting hunting you want to run again now\n[noise] now why\nWell I'd like to be president\nHopefully when we add a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one\nThey're going to be so much work to be done I mean we have everybody in the world including ourselves and we're confused our friends and our enemies like they have no idea what the United States stands for what we're likely to do what we think it's important I felt\nWell she might have a point I mean we knew what it was all about every President Obama hey Roger Iran other countries that will sit back and do a business where there is sometimes people would sit back and say this was kind of like a construction project we're all over the map but sometimes that can be a little good\nYeah I'm thinking this could be part of our foreign policy strategy you know keep them keep a guest and that's that's not a bad thing people don't want\nTo know what's going to be taking place with that Jillian Turner says that immigrants must show a reason if they want to seek asylum but they're not being truthful about\nSecurity officials also stressed the keeping of asylum seekers out in the U.S when the ... border is a difficult\nOne to the Caribbean or ride its members have what's known as a credible fear tasks they got to demonstrate their reasons for not wanting to return to their home country are legitimate\nBut according to US Customs and immigration enforcement quote the extremely low ... incredible fear is ripe for fraud and it'd be a silent systems being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity not those fleeing persecution\nBut I'm told by everybody out there than the reason why these people by the way you've been deported five six seven eight times where I watched an opposing but coming back or political refugees no there wasn't there are seeking economic opportunity if they are\nI understand that here's my question what economic opportunity or they seek it you know what I'm saying\nYeah you apply for a job but what job you can apply for the company you exactly maybe uh maybe some illegal at a prize hopefully God interesting Mars is as we

our ... is the three hour an hour or two but the three fast as ours anywhere and morning talk radio here and the state of Florida again dean Roger Henderson you don't have to agree but at least Roger they have to admit that entertaining that's\nRight very entertaining program to wake up to every morning so let's get to it as we continue to move along at\nDean here I guess what Ron just Santa said the latest numbers out there and show that Andrew Gillum according to the CBS tracker poll has Rick Scott and Bill Nelson tide will get to that in a moment\nBut Ron just saying is is internal poll say he's up by one or two but the latest CBS tracker poll shows Andrew Gillum is leading Ron dissenters by one run Assange is was in South Florida are you ready for this\nThe crowd response to Andrew Gillum guess how they respond to him lock him up and I'm like you are inclined to me because of the FBI investigation that\nIs pretty much taking place certainly numbers show that the Republicans are up\nWhen it comes to some of the early voting and absentees but Democrats say that they'll make of that difference Roger remember about two weeks ago Republicans were leading them about nine percentage points that number's been dropped about about two point eight Democrats say what the early voting that they plan to make it up record numbers\nEven I think ah even reports or as a in Sarasota do all the legality South Florida under democratic counties showing double or triple digit increases in early voting than data over two thousand fourteen so do its for Republicans to act like this was a shoo in I don't think so\nThat's right and you know we don't expect this produced typically with you know off year elections like we're in the midterms right now the turnout satisfy we've seen almost a tripling of the people participating ... at least early voting so far this year it's amazing\nMay I ask a question in cities like Jacksonville\nOrlando\nGifford, Florida a predominantly black communities but ... but in heavy for example like Orlando Jacksonville that the ... big chunk of the Democrats are made up by those in the black community Roger right when you look at me straight for okay um yeah I Know you're taxing lot more [laughter]\nThis is just as you get your order down here in a moment you want to get it yet\nAre we seeing these souls to the polls out there or are we seeing what we've seen I mean I was at church on Sunday where the pastor says we do not endorse anybody in this you know it it didn't it for office there are recommendations by a group along with it could be biblical\nDays out in the foyer Roger if you want to see them then you go back in and take a look at that and let's see what's you know that's how they do it but have we seen this in the black communities right now the black churches whether they're Baptist rainy are we seeing the souls to the polls were ballots are normally filled out and tell you how to have we seen anything about\nThat I haven't heard anything about that first year at all so far I think people were making their minds of a lot of it especially the amendments are a little confusing I think the people at the time it was Robert overall voting I don't think I see that there's you know\nWe don't see that whatsoever to CBS tracker poll against shows a tie between Bill Nelson and governor Rick Scott\nLet me start with a couple of states that I think will tell the story at least early on election night I'll watch it next week the first is Florida and that race we have tied between Rick Scott and the incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\nScott seems to get a boost from his handling of the recent hurricane there that may be helping him out\nAgain majority of the increases double digit in triple digit increases this year compared to that of two thousand and four teen\nRichard Bowers how many all know what the name right again the the synagogue shooting do we have it right or I'm Sorry it's Robert Ballard\nKilled eleven over the weekend\nHe faces twenty nine charges somewhat your punishable by the death penalty plus multiple counts of\nHate crimes out there as well before the shooting powers targeted Jews in frequent posts on social media platforms to use anti Semitic slurs complained the president Donald Trump was surrounded by too many Jewish people and blamed the Jews for helping migrant caravans\nAnd Central America Washington Times reports on Monday that despite the less efforts are trying to find some way to blame President Trump media buzz Howard Kurtz says the media rhetoric they'll send you to be held accountable especially when you look at the track record of what's take place with rhetoric and violence over the last several years\nRecently I mean it's not one sided doesn't the press also have a responsibility to be more careful in what's reported in inflammatory language on attacks you know there's a long history here in a blame game depending on who the target is just so we talked about the security at the Republican and a baseball practice last year in\nVirginia Steve squeeze almost killed and the the the guy who hated Republicans\n... ... ... left wing rhetoric can't be blamed for that so I'm trying to do that people like Rachel Maddow show she had absolutely nothing to do with this guy watch Fox News the mailbox and it had nothing to do with and this goes back to you know Sarah Palin being blamed even recently by the New York times when the shooting of Gabby Giffords she could she put out a political map\nWhen Timothy McVeigh below appeal while I'm a city federal building Bill Clinton went out to Rush Limbaugh for fostering a climate of hey this has to stop the these are not the people responsible we should hold him accountable when they go too far in their rhetoric including the president and others including the media\nBut the Democrats don't see it that way former communications director Adrian ... says that the violence that's taken place and the rhetoric still is to be blamed at the top\n... on the line for a long time last night and going out for a long time there is kind of a threat to the pipe bomb they said oh today and I hope private I Do a lot of state run Garland for political party however\nSponsor barely ... countries that are not far from President Trump\nAnd the media is not seen that from President Trump maybe the media needs to report instead of all the other people on CNN calling Trump big it wants to eradicate those in the black community\nAh also wants to eradicate 'cause he doesn't like Jews as funny that's mere largest got out of West palm but all the other areas out there where he just wants to get rid of all the people do ask whole countries that's what we also heard over the weekend unfortunately\nOut there when it came to this here's the question\nIf we're going to use the guilt by association if you wanted to weigh it out Roger and wouldn't want to do play dead but everyone else it is to what's taking place when you look at the mass\nMurders in shooters would you blame on the right would you blame on the left I mean when you saw the uh the shooter that their jak almost killed\nTo five ... or email or you'll be\nPresident Obama was back on the campaign trail you know talking about how hey you didn't build this that's right Trump thrown by made in the town I mean there have been I drove the car in the ditch and whatever he says the Republicans are notorious like Trump for making up things politicians for lion [noise]\nPoliticians have exaggerated\nThen it turns out to be harder to\nDidn't work out [noise]\nBut what we have not seen before [noise]\nOur recent public like\nJust blatantly\nKnow we've never seen like like maybe I mean if you want to play the part is and label here you know what twenty five hundred dollars you can say keep your doctor as you know what rocket a kick you off your plan a he said\nThat all after he told people that the insurance rates would go up and you may have to lose your doctor\n[laughter] speaking out this big caravan continues to what is it maybe thirty days away Jillian Turner from Fox News says that\nWhen those out there that are coming to this country talked about why they're showing up here by the way the Washington Post offices reported that many of these individuals have been deported many times\nThat they're not being truthful with ice agents\nIsland seekers out in the U.S when the ... the border is it difficult can\nOnce the Caribbean or ride its members have what's known as the credible fear cast they got to demonstrate their reasons for not wanting to return to their home country are legitimate but according to US Customs and immigration enforcement quote the extremely low bar for establishing credible fear is ripe for fraud and abuse\nOr asylum systems being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity not those fleeing persecution exacerbating crisis after crisis at our southern border and keeping those who truly need asylum in the back of the line and the numbers bear this out the past decade has seen an exponential surgeon people claiming credible fear\nIt jumped from five percent of migrants entering the U.S in two thousand six thirty nine percent in twenty sixteen and [noise] I don't mean to a fish will say this high percentage of things to good organization and planning\nYou know I'm not a conspiracy but who's planning this organization the caravan who's\nPaying for it I sometimes don't Blakely tell me jokes or I mean do we have anybody because I'm I Know I mean I'd be curious by this Roger first off if they don't ... we're told that they got to pay thousands of dollars to the coyote says what the tournaments for the people that get them across okay well if there's new\nJobs down there if there was a wink of how the people getting the money ... ... I don't know\nThat's right thousands of dollars where did you get the money to you and where do you\nGet the money to get on this caravan to cross this ... I get on that conspiracies I'm just asking who is organizing this\nYou know that's that's a real good question I don't know the answer to that but I Wonder whether or not we need to do a better job as far as public relations letting people do in their home countries are about our guest worker program and how to apply right opposed to just ran across the border you just heard that clip that\nThe majority of them out there that the reason I mean are we going to seek asylum but yet the your economic benefit I get that and the question is is what type of economic benefit they looking for exactly you know is the government to come out and do things out there tripled you talk tripled to eight to five five Megan Kelly\nDone gone\nMany people said how come you Roger not talked about this well we had a lot of other issues on friday show as well but I Want to get to it several you've been emailing me hey are you going to talk about Megan Kelly do you really care well let me bring up what CNN course Cuomo said to her about her comments of blackface\nThey answered the question of how a segment on Halloween costumes can go wrong is when you make it about black face being okay here's NBC's Megan Kelly\nIt's really ... you get in trouble if you are white person who puts on or a black person that puts out a way that we have a kid that was okay as long as you address another character I got\nBack in the day when I was a kid it was considered okay oh I'm Sorry I didn't endorse it she said it was considered okay right back in the day\nAnd there are places in New York would land as she got Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people say that that was racist and like she wants to look like a an around her one day I I don't know how like that got races on Halloween [noise]\nWhite people putting on black face some blacks who were putting my wife is a very different things right now\nPutting on black face and black and white faces very different things\nAre right now ... some of you out there listening all out huge a black but none of that uh I again I was asking Roger\nWhat was the racist comments that making Kelly made I find it I understand why those in the black community would find it very offensive I I get that I just want to know what was the direct racist comment that making telling me that's all I'm just trying to find out who doesn't love Diana Ross\nYeah ... ... school Clinton I heard his day people dressed up like flavor flight they emulate public enemy and Chuck D and fight the power\nAlright and yet he made like Michael Jackson cannot do that anymore\nJimmy Kimble can do it with ... years ago to try and I mean like\nDialect I mean I mean but Rogers exactly correct the bottom line is is that a look at the bottom line is is that are making Kelly just didn't have earrings DJ good morning you're on WB obey\nMorning Matt how's it going hey what's going on this one pretty good\nMan on the way to work I just called to talk about the care of and then you guys both and making sure everything's so I'm going to hit that first of all as an African American male myself like you said that you don't see that direct\nA racist comment in that it's not so much of the fact is a direct threat to call it a little something called dog with apologies we all know\nWhat you're referring to we all know how she was basically giving up has to people who wear black that you guys may not\nUnderstand the historical significance behind black and white black people find that so offensive but if you open up your mind off of it and it brings more than just the headlines\nI Know I'm just asking you about the history of this I I'm not just a great bodily Rogers black and didn't find it offensive he even said that what I'm saying is is that where it was a direct supposedly going out of her way to become a fence and that's all I'm asking\nThat the the whole conversation what what was the reason for the whole conversation being brought up you know what I mean it's not it's not so the fact that everybody on board the gotcha moment you know what I mean and it's not necessarily like that we live on the times where a man like people are just\nThey are out there about these high hold on hold and go ahead Roger okay that's a DJ\nI get the fact of blackface mints rules that was part of what was done to humiliate why people would mock them in years gone by Dr I tried to look at motive even if someone does that says something that is racially offensive\nI Do do I believe that mainly making Kelly meant to be racially offensive and when she said who doesn't love Diana Ross I really don't believe that she she meant that\nBut when you say if you have to put it in context Megan Kelly what they talking heads for Fox\nNews I I Know it comes out and said things like that yeah I guess it's surprising I really wanted to talk of guy I really want to\nTalk about the care of and mad at somebody on I watch Morning Joe every morning man like fear for there to go to a news source in the morning and um they were very very very I'll just say\nConfused on how all of a sudden his whole chair band aid because they care and has been happening for years it just funny how closer and closer to the election we're hearing more and more about the chairman you brought up who's paying for it when you're asking me honestly I think it's the president of the United states\n[laughter]\nI like to use your money like you know Donald Trump civilians by alone is president of the u._s. history he could write the check

they're leaving and they want to come here and you're saying we want men again we want Medicare [noise]\nI don't know I don't think they're lazy I Know a lot of those that come here to work a lot of them get on work visas have you ever seen news I mean I'm not trying to be stereotype you ever seen those at work like like working at the you know way down hard work\nOut in the hot sun picking strawberries and the ... that is that is some real ...\nSomething about them being lazy ... none of you listening to come across from the Caribbean thirty days away that's not being lazy that's but

twenty nine federal charges eleven counts of using a firearm to commit murder and also\nHate crimes weeks before the shooting Bauer had posted on social media is anti Semitic slurs he's not some say wasn't a big fan of President Trump he says that quote Trump was surrounded by\nToo many Jewish people out there despite the er which took place with the shooting the left continues to wants to blame this on President Trump media buzz Howard Kurtz\nAnd today the Washington Post front page or above the fold headline pointing to this and other recent attacks ice critics are saying the president and he'll be gone beyond partisan political confidence outright demagoguery against racial minorities foreigners and prominent Jewish political figure as my heart absolutely\nBreaks for this tightening Jewish community in Pittsburgh where there's a full shooting took place a place of worship the shooter had a history of anti Semitic social postings are again you know loud to rant and rave\nBut as far as President Trump I mean there were many mass shootings ... bottom was president including the tragedy of the nine African Americans killed in that South Carolina church so from the press perspective it's not like the violence began with the Trump Administration\nAdrian ... former strategic director of communications for Hillary Clinton campaign says yeah still a lot of this blamed got to be but at the feet of Trump\nOn their online for a long time out of Washington going out for a long time that there is an airline threat to the pipe bomb so they said oh today and I hope and pray but I Do a lot of faith regardless of political party however\nFind belly everything that he or she will bring those countries that are and to me the phone from Cairo and trying to\nDo the media is not seeing that from President Trump here's a question I like to ask you those listening if this is based on political rhetoric\nPolitical rhetoric right now Bush over the weekend the n._r._a. was to be blamed for the shooting that took place can somebody I'm just asking the questions you can only tell me what ... just recently came out with none of they've already calling can somebody just weren't can you tell me what recent rhetoric theory used the costs are shooting to the Internet has been very quiet lately\nIt's very common to associate the n._r._a. with any of these mass shootings are interestingly though we have not seen any that I'm aware of where the shooter has ever been in our remember\nYeah so I mean how do they get to be blamed it let me ask you a question when five Dallas police officers Roger\nWere shot in two thousand sixteen by Michael Johnson\nWho love black lives matters he was a big supporter but the new Black Panther party which advocates violence against whites\nAnd Jews um he also was a big defender of Louis Farrakhan nation of Islam I I don't recall people blaming President Trump or five Dallas shootings that took place of cops black lives matter led to protest the media throw them under the bus I'm just kind of curious by that\nIt's it's real difficult to see the connection and the consistent with ah with President Trump and again these mass shootings\nSarah Fisher reporter for Axios as the media has\nTo take responsibility for what it reports\nScientists are going to find the ... again ... ... how but in fact is not what caused this particular he was talking to for about an hour and they need to understand what Trump supporters here when it comes from ... ... troops like by the way which makes them feel that way I could account earlier this year I found out prowling channeling\nTwelve have lost their jobs here get political tweets that were taking one side or not there are a lot of them how to do it by the way the median going overboard about the crisis in San ... accountability for ... living in an environment where it can be difficult\nI mean has anybody seen Jimmy Acosta from CNN get punched out no no we went on nothing happened to have dry he's been all these Trump rallies he heavily criticizes the president no one's taking shots at him\nYou know it's all about when it comes along the latest numbers by these no the latest numbers you just let them know once they've done it they can't do it again okay I'm not even go ahead and tell them right now I'm the latest numbers show according\nI'm not even go ahead and tell them right now I'm the latest numbers show according to the CBS News tracker poll Andrew Gillum is up by one here in the state of Florida override does and just Rick Scott the governor of Florida is tied with US Senator Bill Nelson\nLet me start with a couple of states that I think will tell the story at least early on on election night watching next week the first is Florida and that race we have tied between Rick Scott and the incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\nScott seems to get a boost from his handling of the recent hurricane there that may be helping him out\nSo the number is tied but yet one of the biggest issues Roger according to Florida poll numbers out there of course is health care and the economy\nGovernor Rick Scott is supporting big big measure when it deals with the issue of Obamacare clip number three\nI went to tell you about a family with the previous health condition public housing rarely saw Dr where the kids into the mom would try to hundred mile charity hospitals are getting treatment\nThat was my family growing up in the morning or seen insurance companies to cover his condition to my\nConservative friends did you hear that\nBut when I support foreseen insurance companies to cover for using conditions you know it's just another political issue\nFor me personally\nI wouldn't mad so the question I like to ask you should insurance companies be forced to carry cover I should say pre existing conditions the Republicans are now supporting us Roger this was a major move major difference with Governor Rick Scott I Do\nNot recall him ever opposing bet a provision of Obamacare in the past repeal and replace was what are you in a very general sense yeah well\nYou repeal the whole thing yeah preexisting conditions so that's the question I like to ask you what about that does that need to happen President Obama was on the campaign trail talking about the Republican and other Republicans but they're the ones ally and they're the ones that make up everything\nHave exaggerated\nNow he has a plan to drive down health care premiums and deductibles wells do covering pre existing conditions ...

I'm Sorry I don't want to live off of inhumane mhm charities done at the heart not the back what can be done the back pocket I take that back but I Would love to do a lot of publicity for a lot of charity groups does it make you know I have to worry about the business side that's what keeps us why\nDoes the business side work though if you also concurrently force everybody in America to have insurance or even if they don't want it\nWill they try to do that through the mandate and then gave them a choice that said no and I mean\nThe ... there were more ironclad way to force everybody to do what would it make business sense then what what part of the business that's what what would the insurance companies be able to pay for all those who are currently not endanger let's get subsidies by the federal government I mean how many people can't afford it so [laughter] that can be it's possible that couldn't afford to be the tax bill because they were getting also\nThat's that's quite possible as well no that's quite possible as well\nHere's the thing people if they get sick they are going to go to the doctor somebody's going to pay the bill\nHave you ever heard of a ... ... walking clinics that great group health insurance case also go to this quicker ... just going to walk into like pay the eighty bucks here we go you know give me a shot whatever and actually you know I'm feeling fine\nBarge or its policy allows certain of the walk in\nClinic I don't use my insurance policies he goes I Know there's some things I mean we don't need to go to insurance companies for just out of you know common cold out there but the question is is is I mean this is more political when when governor Rick Scott\nAgain I'm just asking a question a lot of Republicans do not like do not support Obamacare not come out and say well we've supported now\nI Want to tell you about a family with him and bringing the cows rarely saw Dr King had a ... mile charity hospitals are getting treatment\nThat was my family growing on life support or seen the insurance companies cover condition now they\nMay be of a pain you know what is the sixty five I say it was a pain fifty years ago you don't have that today anymore you get companies all around you to see you but the point is as well it's it's not government control when the government mandates you you either do it or else\nOkay Obamacare does not live off the individual mandate Obamacare even live off the subsidies are bombing folks we tax the rich the Cadillac plans pharmaceutical taxes we propose taking billions of dollars that about Medicare to fund Obamacare\nAnd then we propose Medicaid expansion and they're still isn't enough money it's like this whole argument by taxing the rich that we just tax a few people will be it doesn't work Jeff good morning on WB obey\nYes good morning what about just some common sense reforms you know ... people and their tools yeah yeah I mean it's just\nIt just is ridiculous and and now in Florida and all the way they have a corner on the market why not up in the health insurance market to other insurance companies that\nAnd that's restricted by law by the way so I just think it's common sense reform where he can get these cost down\nTiger either by the way if if none of the liberals out there like Obamacare but you think that made you think it's 'cause you don't like the insurance companies will folks it was ... excuse me it was Obamacare it was the Obama credit wanting to do business with the insurance companies\nSee the way Obama got into bed with the insurance companies but the company's fault ... more than the other side talk radio W.

really do we really want to go now that we do have a another hour left\nThere could be an argument made that you know your insurance rates won't go up and you can keep your doctor and he really thought that when he said it but I saw something on line where he actually denies that prior to making that statement so unless he got new data and then it turned out to be wrong or\nDo you remember remember last week insurance prices were dropping I don't really talk about a ball is why I don't know where you get that Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail also she was down here with Andrew Gillum over the last few days she says that the country because of you Trump supporters out there that's right you people she says\nNot only is this country confused but you've confuse the rest of the other world\n[noise] honey honey that he want to run again now\n[noise] now ... why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nHopefully when we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one [noise]\nThere's so much work to be done to everybody in the world including ourselves and we're confused our friends and our enemies and they have no idea what the United States stands for what we're likely to do what we think it's important uh so\nI just I Do to the to liberals out to listen to the show even to some of you that may not be a big fan of President Trump my question is are you guys shocked when he campaigned about the only use today\nI mean I I'd say the same thing about Obama Obama told you he was a liberal you know he kept ... governors a liberal not shocked by that I'm just saying oh we all shocked\nBy President Trump's actions\nYou know what you have a very good point and he was saying some off the wall stuff during the campaign people were shocked by it and now he's president and he's still got some also offering sometimes\nUse the same argue with Andrew Gillum when he chose a liberal podcast that if police pull out their guns use their ... or their tasers they've actually gone too far in wind or do you think\nThe fact that they think I'm you know Mr break the law and all this other stuff that they say God Knows I don't want to get like two with\nAll the stuff that they say um I've got to let them know and I only know for police accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot word and quite frankly law enforcement and John Harvey trusting relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser than they have all ready to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they are All right\nSo let's say he becomes governor and in his budget he supports I I Am using the hypothetical supports cutting edge daily supports cutting um things to state run divisions has to do with um mostly police okay are we all going to be shocked by that\nAre you I'm just saying I mean are we going to be shocked you know it's amazing when people Roger you and I I get emails I'm appalled at the times union in Jacksonville, Florida state Augustine record ordeal Leno settle Pruitt conservative under the bus and the editorial you don't my responses I'm appalled at your upon what are you expecting you wouldn't expect\nAny issue I mean some emails on this this morning Megan Kelly\nHe's out at NBC shocker\nShe there because Roger probably basically pointed it out because the ratings were low right CNN course Cuomo because Kelly made the comment and again I'm looking for the motive of racism here Kelly made a comic book ... black face I mean you want to honor somebody like Diana Ross and I mean it was okay in ... she endorsed it but\nThey answered the question of how a segment on Halloween costumes can go wrong is when you make it about black face being okay here's NBC's Megan Kelly\n... you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on the wane or a black person it puts out a way the way that that was okay as long as you address I care\nAbout are you offended by that comment I wasn't offended by it because I didn't see a motive of gain or any type of animosity ridiculed for black people here are more\nControversy on the real housewives of New York with blue and as she is Diana Ross and she made her scandal darker than it really is and people say that that was racist and like she wants to look like they on around her one day I I don't know how like that got raised about Harlow\nI'll listen I knew you know that one of the hottest selling math\nScore I even got what was it Obama bask\nIn two thousand and eight yeah it was almost ... is that mean that I Want to bomb a mascot I'm racism I knew friends I Know my black friends out there that word of mouth war Robbie master supporting Obama and then some of my white friends ... cents Portman Robyn just just just to have chaos at an ... or some Halloween\nI was looking at a documentary on the lake which is used in life and uh back when she was younger she was on the cover of one of these teenage maggots\nHouston's live and back when she was younger she was on the cover of one of these teenage magazines wearing orange lipstick which is common among black girls cry goes generally didn't do that until we the Houston started to now of course\nThe the black face a reference has to do with the minstrel area era and Amos and Andy and how that was humiliating to black people back during that era I think today's generation we're probably not as much about that than the older generation I mean\nDo we have to get rid of Dan Ackroyd character in trading places where he dressed up as a Jamaican black guy I mean does that mean that a ... you know back in high school people use to emulate public enemy flavors play you know what I mean can't do that anymore\nUm uh Eddie Murphy and flood or he he played a Jewish guy in a barbershop 'em up ... ... mother ... movie slobber was ... was the movie Eddie Murphy was coming to America there was it was coming to America\nAnd you don't have always better than I Do it especially the black ones I Know I've just said is it that way why again it if she had I mean again I keep asking a\nQuestion where was that could be a huge audience that's in the black community where is the motive is Roger says we had a caller and I already told you was gonna be guilt by association we had DJ call up and our number two saying which you store for Fox News that we go what was the dog whistle\n... I'm just trying to ask where's the racist that's what I'm just trying to find out where is the racism\nI didn't hear any animosity at our hearts were you when he thinks usage who doesn't love Diana Ross\nI just kind of curious where is the racism triple to talk triple to eight to five five talk radio W.
