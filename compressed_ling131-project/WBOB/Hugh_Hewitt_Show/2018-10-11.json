chicken elections\nContacts in the summertime and what was called to two\nTo five ... ... email and believe me\nThree minutes after the our morning I Am a dean hair long with Roger Anderson the Thursday edition of the morning show a lot going on a lot to talk about\nEspecially with second place a lot with that of course of a Hurricane Matthew which all her came Michael yeah I'm looking at a store and buy Matthew and it was um ... is coming up on the show Dr that's why I was looking at that but anyway tropical storm Michael you remember we were talking about this overnight\nYesterday went from a category two three and a category for\nAs guests of course within that a quarter round the hundred and forty a hundred and fifty miles an hour what do we look how many hundreds of thousands of people without power now I think\nIt reached as much as almost a half a million at everything up and I'm not quite sure if they've gotten those people restore just yet but it was up\nThere well each downgraded to a tropical storm but guess and what's the latest with the store next the weather channel\nNot a good situation now the storm itself is kind of making that transition over to a tropical storm through the overnight so we're not going to see many more wind gusts like this okay I think those wind gusts are over but they are going to be enough wind gusts that\nWe're going to see more tree income now we're going to see more power outages at one point we had about half a million people total without power between you know Georgia Alabama and Florida so this thing is not over yet it's going to say a tropical storm for a little while probably into the Carolinas and maybe even restraint and close to her again as it gets off the coast but it's not going to be a problem then\nWhile they're getting back to another hurricane but I guess is a cold front to nicer temperature is supposed to come here\nIn fact they're ceding will have lows in the mid sixties so is that what is ... ... it was\nGoing to get a little do any music it up a sweater you buy like that oh man nine zero for triple to talk triple to eight to five five\nMore as we continue to move along heading here along with Roger Henderson the latest now a few weeks left within the campaigns twenty something days the top tutor issue according to what Republicans and Democrats seem to be talking about\nIs the issue of Medicare into Obamacare President Trump says that if the Dems\nGet a hold of the house\nEven the Senate you can kiss your Medicare buy in fact they're calling the\nViews by the Democrats that of extremists Bret Baer Fox\nNews always trying to President Trump warning Americans that if Democrats win big in next month's midterm elections the country will move\nDangerously close he says to radical socialist president also contending seniors could lose their Medicare it's part of something of a fighting the extremist strategy for this president and his party to try to maintain control of the house and the Senate\nWait a second before we get to the clips the Republicans calling the Democrats extremist on the issue of the Medicare have we not heard that from years from the Democrats about what\nI Know it's like a complete reversal we expect me to go you could never anticipated been crazy that but again politics\nMore with that chief correspondent John Roberts talks about how that Trump says that the dams would end Medicare but he's there's a reason why that he may be somewhat correct technically if the Democrats can hold the house in the Senate where they could in Medicare old\nSaying goes all politics is local but President Trump is trying to nationalize house and Senate races saying the policies that he has implemented orange ... on the line\nThe latest salvo against Democrats targeting their push for Medicare for all the u._s._a. today op ed the president writing the Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised\nDemocrats including Bernie Sanders who first floated the idea insist expanding Medicare to all Americans will improve coverage for seniors but President Trump points out it will cost thirty two point six trillion dollars in its first ten years\nNow I Want to get to the clips about where the Republicans and Democrats over the next few weeks and how they are going to campaign on Obamacare Republicans want to keep certain parts of it\nBut before I get to that whether you agree with the languages diverge by President Trump technically he is correct and then if you go with the Medicare for all you do and the current Medicare system as we know Roger\nI guess that is accurate dub ... my my thing is just puzzles me how can our elected officials or those running for office that they can promise all these things with no way to pay for it I mean this is very expensive was it three trillion dollars is gonna cost over ten years\nWell wait wait for how much how much what was the thirty to thirty two trillion why they where's the money go to\n... trillion over in fact some numbers have said thirty six but here's the thing that if you really want to get into and discussion about this\nAnd this has been documented in Obamacare cut seven hundred plus billion dollars of ... ... is projected even more to fund\nFrom Medicare to fund Obamacare So that was just ship him I don't want to you need to states to pick up the tab for this okay exactly but the question is is President Trump correct that technically you with it and the current system I mean technically correct you would in the current system is Medicare as we know it ... for Medicare for all\nRight it was the way the seems ... wants to always have the single payer Medicare for all but again as you mentioned that on does everything that we've been expecting an all those who've been paying into the system for years they don't get what they\nPay to your point is how how often do you pay for Bloomberg News talked about the latest now with a few weeks left in the campaigns on how both parties are focusing on the issue which is the number one issue outside of the economy is health care\nThing around warning Obamacare is going to be a major\nPoint for them to kind of like ... how they can actually going to be using it as that even people who don't want to take a victory for me [noise]\nAnd everyone competing among continue hidden fence to the point where people don't really know what exactly is going on except that their opinions wind up ... latest there and they'll probably go down and\nNow she brings interesting point is there was a lot of confusion what's gonna happen or what about my taxes and I'm paying paying the individual mandate and what about the increase is taking place\nAbout my taxes not paying paying the individual mandate what about the increase is taking place so just got into deeper further can get a conversation with Bloomberg News business reporter\nAnna ... says look at the both parties Democrats want to defend the status quo and she says Republicans that were out there talking about repealing replays now want to protect\nAnd keep certain parts of Obamacare\nAround that Republicans are really saying they're going to protect what condition that whole time they're trying to kill their place up on the cat I Wonder if they haven't really been perfect about\nHow they're going to say that I don't think you'll find very many Republican thing they want to have about a\nLot of them are campaigning I think they're going to preserve it came out of hand and to try to figure out which party and couldn't get the blame for rising healthcare costs and I think like so many things in the country\nComing around some have said that Democrats are going to try to use the storms as the bushes version of Hurricane Katrina we President Trump I've actually heard some people trying to his demeanor going to be looking for that said they can't\nAll be about global warming and climate change but yet even more ally license from National Public radio says when you look at all the issues that Democrats are talking about he says even though they may end up winning he says politically believe it or not they're struggling\nTo important because it's a big debate going on inside of the Democratic party heard Hillary Clinton should they be Michael ... Democrats in other words should they be the left wing equivalent of Donald Trump fight back just like he does or should they stand for something as Michelle about what they hire you know they don't know what\nWhich direction they want to go there is a lot of feeling inside the Democratic party especially in the activist base the Democrats are to link there not tough enough\nAnd what does that mean you know and it for something and it's a way that they didn't take that back it's going to be even\nMore tougher debate you know I I understand that point I mean Republicans have always had okay do we try to become more moderate with Iraq Obama do we try to run more conservative now the Democrats have the same problem with them do they really want to go far left or they want to try to Maine somewhere between the far left in the middle\nYou know it's so interesting that you hope we especially with tragedies like research came that the country could come together and not try to blame each\nOther and that's what's happening we already know that we're talking specifics now for the auto touch generics so can you be a great person I Would have a generic pull Rogers had to get into specifics we all the country could come to ... we already know that right what I'm saying is is that when you look at the s\nThat again they want to use is I mean it was CNN last night couldn't wait to talk about global warming\nAnd it that's the case you can't get hold of ... I mean I mean you've got national\nGuard troops out there you've gotten people search and rescue something's going to take place by saving lives when it comes to hurricanes you got the Cajun Navy you're the Cajun Navy and all they want to talk about global warming\nYeah they're going to do that every time the storm's going to happen to have to get some too into that and we got through to pay the ... their their their their their soap box is the issue and in fairness to them they really do believe in and it it was just making stuff up out of the clear blue sky\nAs you know everybody's going to be talking about polls polls polls coming out of the woodwork Laurie anger him says that when when you look at President Obama's Reagan their first terms Trump's got the same approval rating is what they had\nWith higher approval ratings I Know I think colonel NBC poll has the president at forty four percent the highest ever in that poll which is also on a par with where Reagan was in Nineteen eighty two and world bomb was twenty two\nNow what are the pros and cons about that right there\nWell when you compare that to Obama vis was around the time and Obama interact and yet at will Reagan I don't know I Can't go to Obama Obama's this is what he was really pushing Obamacare and the public didn't want it and he was pushing it to cause a lot of his would be popularity become to diminish okay let's get a little\nBit more specific okay you've heard what she says that have a lower Ingram says this is the the president has the same numbers as Reagan\nHad an eighty two and ... and Obama had in two thousand and chat do we now both of those presidents went on to win re election bid now she looting that yes but let's be also remind the individual out there than in eighty two Reagan lost twenty five plus house seats got select\nWhat happened to President Obama and the Democrats in two thousand and ten he got ... also got shut lacked as well\nNet Ryan with the American majority says it even when you look at a lot of the polls and he says even though millennials may be up as far as still supporting Democrat and a lot of cases they're down even when you look at the poll numbers out their base on the economy even among minority voters you\nThink it would tend to favor President Trump\nBut there's some other interesting dynamics that are taking place political shift that are taking place I think because of the economic news quarter to pull back in twenty sixteen\nOr Eighteen or thirty four year old young Americans white Americans showing that by a margin of fourteen points they favor the Democratic party they did that same poll just a few days ago\nThat fourteen point margin is gone it's now thirty nine to thirty nine among those young Americans and and party versus party the other interesting dynamic last week we saw Hispanic giving Trump eight ten point boost and approval ratings among that community and so I think one of those interesting dynamics\nTen point boost and approval ratings among that community and so I think there's anything that was it again the political shift that are taking place in certain demographic color or an\nAgain these polls we keep more fascinated with them to see if this does come to fruition after the election but the question is you could have these approval numbers here Roger the question is is do they turn out the ...\nIt's hard to say I was talking to a political strategist yesterday a friend of mine and uh the black vote of approval rating for Obama for President Trump is twenty percent that is huge within the black you\nReally have ended up you know overall nationwide or here in Florida\nI Believe it was based in wide and that's unprecedented because ... you know of all things she will historically African Americans especially recently have been lock stock and indigo association with the Democrats tripled Utah triple to eight to five\nGuys throw a trick question why do you think there were such we have a big increase of those in the black community Roger that are Republicans that listen to this radio show this is kind of a trick question but I Want to do what you think you're ready for this why are there quite a few several black Republicans here in Jacksonville\nI have an answer but I Want to know what your answer is tripled to talk triple to eight to five five

fray again have you ever noticed that Democrats are campaigning on it but let's be honest\nYou hear Republicans campaigning on it here with that with the latest says Bloomberg News\nAnd getting around for morning Obamacare is going to be a major\nPoint for them to tell me like things are how they can actually going to be using it as ... who don't want to take a victory lap and then I for me\nThe number one continued everyone continue here in San ... way people don't really know what exactly is going on except that their opinions wind up ... latest here and they'll probably go down a little bit next\nYear I think she brings up an interesting point I think a lot of people are confused so who's to blame for the increase in premiums that will not only take place throughout the rest of the country but also here in Florida business reporter for Bloomberg News and entertain says that both parties believe it or not may not be talking about Obamacare but when they do\nThey talk about I mean the Democrats talked about protecting the status quo now Republicans don't want to be blamed for the premium hikes increases out there and yet they talk about protecting certain measures of the current system of Obamacare\nThat Republicans are really saying that they're going to protect Frankenstein conditions have said that the whole time they were trying to kill it our place to care\nPre existing conditions have said that the whole time they were trying to kill their place of on the care\nI Wonder if they haven't really been specific about how they're going to say that and so I don't think I find very many Republicans saying they want to have on a cat and a lot of them are campaigning by saying they're going to preserve the provisions out of their sense of self ... to try to figure out which party is going to get the blame for rising healthcare costs\nAnd I think like so many things in the country these days it's going to come down along partisan lines caught they're going to blame Republicans for all the answer and say what they were ... were killed our place effort that talent announces her hailing the individual mandate and attacks last year which\nAdded plants are into the market and how to increase public and they're still planning what they call it that file\nThem on a first off which help increase costs but to those being subsidized so the people that are paying for it they're the ones being blamed here's a question why do you think Obamacare premiums are going up\nA Obamacare ... are going up I think probably because she counted on every one being a part of it a hundred percent and a lot of people just refuse to get health insurance and that causes premiums to a higher for those who do\nAnd even Melissa Frances says from the Fox business news that have you ... the the issue of Obamacare is more popular than it is your tax cuts\nPrize finding a new poll revealing Americans Obamacare more favorably than the ... tax cuts for what will it mean for the midterm elections I mean ... what would make it at first I have to say that I I discount pose now and people hate it when I say that's especially people who pay for\n'em but after the last elections that we have to take every poll with a grain of salt I'm the only thing that struck me as the unfavorable they're really high too if you look at people who view attacks on favorably forty one percent so that's obviously more than are favorable\nI'm In favor of on Obamacare forty four percent\nAnd you know those numbers have been pretty much consistent Hadley manning from the independent women's forum says when it comes to this and this issue of Obamacare and what the president talks about he says that with the Democrats get their Medicare for all that eliminate Medicare as we know it she says Republicans just got to give you a better job of messaging\nWell we've known for a long time that Obamacare is a divisive issue and in fact the percentage of people say that they favor at our support it even in the polls at fifty one percent so that's not\nAnd not something to write home about however they pay tax\nPlan is forty percent approval so that can be concerning for Republicans to be reminded that they need to be communicating well about what the lie dies and the fate of the economy and you know reminding people that objective way our economy is pretty good shape on the other hand Obamacare an eight year old law now and I think it's starting to enjoy and what we call a status quo advantage\nHey I'm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one at one point

B. dot com [noise]\nMore as we continue to move along ed dean hear the question also comes up in the midterms one of the biggest issues that now it's come into the fray President Trump is brought up the issue of the Medicare for all these is the Democrats gain control it gives you can kiss your Medicare good by John Roberts from Fox News\nSaying goes all politics is local but President Trump is trying to nationalize house and Senate races saying the policies that he has implemented orange ... on the line with\nThe latest salvo against Democrats targeting their push for Medicare for all the u._s._a. today op ed the president writing the Democrats playing means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised\nDemocrats including Bernie Sanders who first floated the idea insist expanding Medicare to all Americans will improve coverage for seniors but President Trump points out it will cost thirty two point six trillion dollars in its first ten years\nNow President Trump technically is correct that if the Democrats to get their Medicare for all the wheel and the current system of Medicare\nAnd it's really a play on words because if you give it Medicare for all it's technically a brand new programs they probably if they want to go that way and of course I'm not encouraging this probably call it something else to try to keep alive from being so blurred Byron\nYork says when you talk about the issue of the President Trump calling the Democrats extreme on the issues of repealing the tax cuts the impeachment of what am I Do to the market\nBut he says isn't it interesting that the Republicans for years he's been Democrats for years have called the Republicans extreme on the issue of Social Security Medicare now the rules have been reversed again Byron York from the Washington Examiner\nWhile the Republicans are extremely on message now from the president on down to it and it's an old message it's used against Republican so many times they are the Democrats are extremist they're dangerous is too much of a chance they're an angry mob they will take away your Medicare\nI mean this this is a very interesting the campaigns they've centered on\nAnd talking to Republicans working to to ah keep the house\nUh they've had the best week or so polling that they've had in quite a while and they attributed most of it to the cabin off at a so they're they're still scared they're very scared but they're feeling better they're\nScared but they're feeling better the Dems according to some of the numbers out their town hall dot com as of today\nSays that with a story that the Democrats do not look like they have any hope of even gaining back the Senate Republicans may pick up a few seats of course the house of representatives\nMaybe a different story but even National Public Radio's Mara Liasson says that the dams politically are struggling which way they're going as a campaign with a few weeks left and if they win the house they may struggle and how they may want to do was certainly measures they may want to bring up they may struggle with that as well\nWho important because it's a big debate going on inside of the Democratic party heard Hillary Clinton should they be Michael ... Democrats in other words should they be the left wing equivalent of Donald Trump fight back just like he does or should they stand for something as Michelle about what they hire you know they don't know what\nWhich direction they want to go and there's a lot of feeling inside the Democratic party especially in the activist base the Democrats are two week not tough enough\nAnd what does that mean you know and this is something and it's a way that they didn't take that back it's going to be an even\nMore tougher today are ... are\nBoth parties going through a ... an identity problem I mean the dams you have traditional dams and I wonder if they love to take off the shirt and share their Superman colors that that\nWould they would love to go for you know the the minimum wage it's fifty no compromise right they love to go for the Medicare for all um but then again the Republicans you think would have the wind up their back on the issue of deregulation and the economy cabinet seems the only thing that might may save them do both parties have major problems right now and messaging\nI Do believe they do because uh you know you've got you know the facts is broken down you know and the Democrat side you have the\nA socialist liberals that are a great gaining a lot of traction especially with millennials on the Republican side you have those you up or more of the what they call what is it the traditional conservatives versus those who who want to be a little bit more aggressive and appealing to every one of the only way they can handle that is about pandering to each group\nSaid that they're that when they're talking to that group\nBut when you get on TV you're talking to everybody and that ends up dividing it and I think that's why we're seeing so many people switching from the major parties to non party affiliated\nPulling the top tier issues with a few weeks left of course when you look at the polls traditionally has been the economy and Obamacare here with that issue with Bloomberg News\nAnd getting around pointing Obamacare is going to be a major\nPoint for the metabolites hands or how they can actually going to be using it as a reason to take a vacation to four weeks [noise]\nConsidering competing and everyone containing him than to the point where people don't really know what exactly is going on except that their opinions went up ... latest there and they'll probably go down and out of an active\nThe question is if the premiums are going up who is to blame is it President Trump and the Republicans will voters blame the Republicans in President Trump or do you ... ...\nYeah I don't I don't I don't think Obama campaign on black issues I never I never thought about it and\nBut there are those who would try to make it looked like he was just this black radical who was only go to the moon to represent the black community\nComing up at seven thirty Dr Merrill mouthpiece forms that Tom columnist I think it's seven forty five Adam Angie I've skied from open the books dot com I call it they'll rip off of the week James good morning you're on WB will be\nMore and guys yeah like to comment on the health care issue but I Do yeah up your questionnaire it um [noise] I Want to go with um I Believe there are more black Republicans in Jacksonville due to the former mayor Alvin Brown\nYou know I said I was even on my list that is a good answer on no but that's a good one why would you have brown I mean that the genes that is a great response why would you say Alvin Brown\nI Would say Alvin Brown because on on many issues\nAre saying more than I think sixty percent I Would side with dollar and brown sure well when he was mayor and I'm I mean I'm I'm a Republican I'm not I'm not I'm not a total conservative um you know sometimes a moderate but yeah I could relate to our and browse policies\nBad as it relate them ... gas\n... yeah that's a good guess\nThat's okay that's good I I figured I'd give it a try a on the health care issue here is the way I feel about I'm Glad the Republicans are bringing that up because\nLike I used to I like to say that you know the Republicans own that President Trump's to a ... a tax reform and jobs acts you know and I like to say well how many Democrats voted for that\nWell then we can switch that around with Obamacare So I can say okay well how many Republicans voted for Obamacare when they pushed it through the so it's kind of like a\nFood back issue as far as I'm concerned 'cause I Want to we really we I wanted Obamacare to work ... hour work because you know because there is a sort of a healthcare crisis in America so but it didn't work so I think the Republicans just sit back and let it\nKinda fail as it goes and try to tweak it and try to improve it as as we go but\nYou know I I I understand what you're saying but but it's kind of like saying\nWhen somebody accuses you something politically within twenty four forty dollars you can't let it go unanswered you're going to answer it back right and ... and the Republicans have dropped the ball I mean they got into some parts of the or the medical device tax pharmaceutical tax to catalogue land but they still needs to be addressed this is still a number when Robert tuition in the country in Florida\nAnd both parties believe it or not are not addressing\nExactly there are a lot of people who actually criticize Republicans saying that they wanted Obamacare to drag out cause as much harm to the American people as possible so they can have something to run on against Obama for his ... and the Democrats you're not\nSaving August it has a lot of harm to Americans by keeping it around\nVets what I'm saying keeping it around giving us something to do as a campaign tool to you is\nThat if you let it stand you're hurting America to\nYeah that's true not that I speak on the line with I'm just before Obamacare I think it's honestly say that there was a health care problem in the country as ... pointed out I just don't think Obamacare was necessarily the right approach\nOkay let's go to Lawrence Lawrence I'm throwing you a softball right now widely in ... there was one person\nI could give you a big hat there was one person in Jacksonville I Am an assumption believe that there are a lot of reasons why that there are a lot more real conservatives but a lot more of those in the black community better GOP who was that person\nGo rent that is exactly correct for that is the correct name is\nGo ahead Lawrence biggest recruit and to explain why to the audience\nBecause you know you look at color and brown and you saw everything that was wrong with the Democratic party yeah she she was just ... you know just corrupt she was ignorant on a lot of issues and things and and and um [noise]\n... you know like I say ... ... ... ... in in the beginning it was her and Terry Brady ... all the stuff that was happening with the school system but um yeah Curran brown was our biggest a demon and the Democratic\nParty and we would just show or a you know and right would be and\nAnd Lawrence the reason why and by the way let me just say and and lord comes to a lot of our events by the way our big second year anniversary Lawrence I Hope you're going to be there we're either going to have it or the no ... in the next couple of days whether we're going to have it on the thirtieth November when the seventh of December by\nLawrence was an inspiration Lawrence for this question here because they talk about you know Roger said what I don't know who it was but Roger said in in our number one you were talking with the political strategist ... in Rogers says that according to his strategist friend that ah\nThe ... river Abou approval rating of President Trump is somewhere around twenty percent in the black community\nSays Hi Lawrence that kinda got me thinking okay if there is just in Jacksonville I mean everybody\nThe name of that kinda got me thinking okay if there is just in Jacksonville I mean everybody thought it was Kanye West towards that Obama was the Trump lord but it was Korean brand because I covered her for years as a reporter but you also said\nThat when you guys with Jennifer ... others you through other black Republicans against their little ... yeah they used to ... you and those in the black community for not supporting the Democrat remember that\nRight yeah yeah with a you know you got to be true to what you believe in and and the current brown was definitely true and what she believed in so it was a good\n... even if she didn't know what she was believing why why she keeps getting reelected over and over again\nWell it is it's a phenomenon I used to ask people I said you know she's a crook\nBut you know what they used to tell me well she's our ... you know so it it it's so ingrained in them to devote Democrat same situation with the thing when I'm when I'm the presidential election when\nWhen was the guy's name brown that was a libertarian was running a lot of people voted for him and do all county because the brown said you know wherever they are brown on UC brown on the ballot you need to you know vote for\nBrown rice that was the two thousand election remember right yeah where are you got a lot of votes down there and the black community\nBecause of his last name brown yeah what happened was that they were saying that a lot of people were taken to the polls to vote for brown I Believe Nelson and there was someone else and they ended up voting for two presidential candidates\nGore shows yeah give 'em and they were in their ballots were thrown out right\nAll right Lawrence I knew you going to get the answer man good to talk more brown yeah so anyway Ronnie Robbie Ricky and Mike Ralph and Johnny really wants to get that was of course I come up with a great question twenty six minutes after the our talk radio W.

whole lot easier [laughter]\nYeah I understand you're coming from I I I don't think the government's ever going to be out of the healthcare industry the bottom line is ... you know if you pay for cash and you get a cheaper right but but the insurance is a little bit more costs like go figure that let's go to John John good morning you're on WB you'll be\nPaying the price of Obama cash if the Democrats who cost us so that is what happened last thought Hillary we was going to get elected so when they when they created that the Obama plan they figure they price will go up it was collapsed

question is is the main one who is the blame for it is that Trump is it the Republicans as Republicans along with the Democrats the reason my costs are going up and healthcare especially through the current premium system Harold Good morning you're on WB obey\nI just wanted to get my two cents on the healthcare um it's become a political thing where each side tries to blame the other side for the costs going up I'm truthfully both sides\nHave not been able to find a way to control the costs are keep that costs from going up and they both have different ideas but really neither one of them can control it the price of\nHealth care goes up on its own right it's not the price of insurance it's not one political party or the other they both just keep trying to solve the problem but the problem is just a problem within itself I mean the cost of healthcare just goes up and somebody has to pay it\n[noise] [noise] um I don't know if people are talking about it very much other than the fact\nThat in order to expand if he's going to have to come up with all kinds of new money right and if he comes up with new money what he's telling people is that we're going to increase corporate taxes don't worry we won't touch you corporate taxes and that increase will pay for this but it won't pay for it which means that the election if he wants to can now that he's going to have to add income\nTo your point Matt according to the Democrats like Tracy Paulson another Ninety seven percent of the companies in the state of Florida don't pay corporate tax is that true\nThat I don't know okay but you know what I don't know how you can kind of information I mean I'm sure she can do that but but yeah I Want to live up here I'm not going to answer a question that I don't know the ... let me re asked the question so here's the question I Would ask them is also\nRunning against Wyman ... running against who okay anyway um\nFireman Doug in Yahoo huh\nHere's a question and here's a question\nHow can Andrew Gillum said then how can you say now folks are you ready for this how can you say we can raise enough money by taxing the corporate tax rate it\nAccording to the Democrats the majority of companies don't pay corporate tax rate then you've got a couple of the mind somewhere else that yeah yeah do you understand what I'm going to supply become small but let's say you're assuming that what Tracy Paulson is that is correct\nThat you can you know unfortunately campaign did who respond against her\nWyoming I mean who that's his new name who did he respond against her

while I'm driving but anyway I'm a physician as you\nProbably know one of his mouth about forty six years and I can assure you next time you go through your physician's office to take a look around\nAnd realize that for every ... they're they're probably street people ancillary including a war at least one person who is chasing money\nAnd that person is employed to the tune of time I checked which was about three or four years ago uh eighty five thousand dollars a year and that money coming directly out of money that you pay in your premiums et cetera\nIt never used to be like a guy and ... the ... of ancillary personnel in medicine has just astonishing anybody who can pay attention and those should be kicking the can\nAnybody who can pay attention and those should be taken into consideration\nCash a quick question in regards to um\nI Know I had a has is that why most solo practitioners of it ended up being bought by hostile to your point oh\nYeah yeah you you you still can afford it and put one of the hospital by the practice the gift you know\nAllowing them to check all the way that they charge tremendously\nOkay let me let me get going but here here's is what I'm getting at if if the government sets the prices\nFor what Medicaid or Medicare Medicare and but yet I've been told by the left that we need to control the prices people making too much money well wait a second if the government sets the prices on the doctors but the doctors are making too much money\nCan the government be blamed for also part of the problems as well outside of being involved in certain aspects of the regulations they put on certain Mandela\nMay one ... one group that they they control and regulate that has been very good in the world look at education whether US military probably be the exception but because of who I second day don't actually control you have\nA military people running that thing okay but look at education and it's gone downhill because they got their fingers and we have a department up and\nThey see it as probably ten twenty thousand people telling everybody well let's just do away with them ... period and I may not sincerely why do we have an Energy Department is working pretty bad because of all the great things fracking and solar power has gone down in price a lot of things to try dominoes government interfering\nWho's got the advantage
