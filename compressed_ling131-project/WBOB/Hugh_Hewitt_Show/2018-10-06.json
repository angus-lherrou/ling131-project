thing and maybe with the eighty degree has maybe it's going to drop a little bit more out of course uh it probably will drop this week if they're\nTalking about as much rain is we're supposed to have you know I\nThink I'm there say in a some Sunday night and then uh I think I'm\nTuesday through friday something like that especially Iran yeah I bet that salinity will be all the way to the mouth of the river\n[laughter] I Know it is ... ... why would it should be yet\nI mean that was a look at some of that stuff and I'm a reading different things you know like in in a a fishing connection I'm about uh you know the salinity levels and all that stuff I mean they're talking I'm just so many of the level usually\nAt ... normally thirty parts per thousand and as running around twelve to Seventeen and at the Danes point area's been five to twelve and rain branch yet and Jay you around one to six\nOr ... as per a duck the Clinton White and um you know we're talking about that and he's got a tear under Jim supers article which is um get some good information about different things but I'm John Edward what that's what really kind of got my attention\nJohn Tierney sent me a new cities on them\nAt a pretty good ... the other day so that kind of goes hand in hand\nWith all the yeah and then when they get all that freshwater affair\nI guess we can do is give some of them big speckled perch ah gets who ... really they bring a book bag and release them in ... and get them going in there\n[noise] yeah I'm surprised I haven't heard of anybody kitchen more tilapia in Reno we've got ... you know usually Rand downtown in the south of downtown and I haven't heard much about those um here lately and uh I'm kinda surprised with the water saline they like it is that we haven't heard more about him\nAnd an amazing how much they look like a triple tail it's\nYeah and uh yeah I bet you people do mistake him at times you know the advantages of do they do but I'm\nSo far what we are so and I'm right here today have twins tend to Fifteen not a cease three to five feet was the casualties at six feet and slight chance of showers Tamara east north east wins ten to Fifteen knots these four to six feet with the cages these up to eight feet and of course all of that\nUm some of these swells we're supposed to be getting from that hurricane is way out and then decided to Bermuda I forget the name of\nThe uh the one they're calling my that would not high on my Michel ... down in the Caribbean ones didn't\nAgree with you know it would be as um and it's supposed to come up through the Gulf and I'm a dog is supposed to supposedly gets to\nA Louisiana but last night's um thing they were showing it may be coming up to the panhandle and where they don't think it'll be a hurricane yeah just just to tropical storm or not even a tropical storm but tropical weather\nBut that's what's just delete or be pulling some of that moisture rather laying right across that\nDidn't make a U turn because the other night Tim dig and it was on uh the one out ... was talking about the the one in the Caribbean and he was they had one in the Caribbean\nThat has swept off of like you know it was down just east of Yucatan and was like oh and instead of uh east to west I mean it was going west to east of the same which\nIs unusual you know usually a storm start over there\nAs thunderstorms on ... on the coast of Africa we're right on the African interior they started off as massive groups of thunderstorms and then they moved offshore strengthen and they get on those trades or whatever those those prevailing ... was really wins and just get swept across the Atlantic\nHave you heard Rebecca is report on that no I haven't yeah she's she's always dead on yeah\nAnd she can tell your own ... into\n[laughter] yeah 'cause that's being done ... this week the yeah they're being a a ... team\nIs that he needed a boat the big raft salt love boat and yeah not a big old but big old is a A R sale\nAnd I think um it was let's see I Believe it was a\nSunday we were out there and I saw it might have been Monday but then I Can't remember now but anyway um that when it was kind of given him a fit because if best pretty good size but you know discussion real half sides on\nThis one of the big ones that you won't see a troll and motor of on the ... yeah I think that when a slightly out of the window there [laughter]\nBut it reminds me of Ted Ted's but it looks excellent with the rap he's got on there that red fish on the just right yeah uh but ... but looks good too they did a real good job with a wrap\nYeah a bit Don's but looks good too they did a real good job\nWith a yeah I think my neighbor about ... ... you get the the one she got the same kind of wrap on it and uh one of my neighbors like a three doors down um has his own soul life but\nIt was the complaint about people following him around were [laughter] I'd be probably they probably would um\nYou know that you didn't uh they they never on it for you guys they never really there are\nThere but I read the load [laughter] let's see now is how could a mayor ...\n... the now they're talking a Monday east when Fifteen to twenty not a Tuesday Fifteen to twenty and that uh the southeast and then finally coming down to ten to Fifteen on Wednesday\nWe're back to ... show and I turn there's hits home just so I could hear the draw the line and we'd be lively we get\n... more and more of their own and Taylor going on yeah you do it\nA pretty good I was wondering how is that they were doing catch a fish or you're like personal a fish tank and bacon\nOr actually yeah he's got to be of legal ... the ... you can't take it and you can do it right you can see you cannot be in possession of a illegal fish so\nYeah but if he goes no difference drive from going in catch 'em on another line or catch on for your fish tank right\nOr wrong I don't think so I mean not I don't know that\nThat I thought I mean you know like if they're making a legal cause I dive in and that you know they say you can catch a money you know the problem is you can't go in the ocean and get your money and bring it up though so you got to get some in shallow\nWater so there's this club down in South Florida called blue heron bridge I don't know if you heard that bridge\nTo nowhere to yeah and how long have you had\nDivers are like going crazy now because this group or they're out of Texas they have this Koreans called moody an aquarium in Galveston, Texas so they got an apartment I don't know if they want to research to fish or not so they\nCame down like that a bunch of fish and ... like pissed off saying oh we need that Bob but this and this is totally unacceptable they can't keep fish are you serious I mean if they got a permanent legal what did you ever think\nCatching the red snapper the golf you know when I was there was\nNo money changing hands it shouldn't shouldn't be an issue\nYeah I mean and also you know if they get a permit for it I mean the ... they got permission to do it I don't know I Know that I Know up\nAnd like the pictures I showed a shared on my uh north Florida fish a page out you can find a face but at that but she showed up they shut them all the permits and everything\nYou can get a good for them to and deadly they're doing it legally I mean that's you know I just didn't have any idea but the uh you know I Know of one person that got um worn by the ... ... bc and fish taken away from having a small sheep's head in Korean and\nOh yeah you can't do that that the game fish but either like legal based that could be going up WC it said you can catch like couple angel fish and catch plenty but so these people are catching them\nThere with the college there's a way to Texas A M college and Madame Clara and they came on second legally and then all these Peter lovers are complaining 'cause they they they wiped them totally clean they said they're eight dollar fish there's no more\n... to ... you can do with the sergeant major looks like a sheep so it was a whole lot more stripes\nOh yeah but the problem in no small you know you don't want to take\nFish from the ocean and put it may require them to let you know you're doing all these people have their their going and collecting the space and put it that way they have like thousands and thousands and thousands of gallons of water fail heard it but if you take a fish from\nThe ocean land I can put it in their way on the L I got a small system said that like a hot tub you know it's really hard to control the system that bitch got bacteria or whatever and it it'll outbreak your tank and then next thing you know your tank it's crashed as he puts up and found allowed into the\nYeah Bishkek mhm yeah I can understand that I had it\nYeah 'cause they got like ... you can't see it and then and that's why if you go to one person and you put an era where we have to like a ... and stuff that way doesn't have any like\nLike pets to him again thinking we put in there you have to\nTake him to the doctor first and chickens pedigree mixtures okay for you put them in the tank\nSomething like that they make this held all the uh like bacteria and stuff or anything on it\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThey're just getting back to mend prerogative first pictures of him and\nThen put him in the coldest no\n[laughter] no matter who's carrying on ... [laughter]\nYeah they can harassed fishermen they arrested her catching fish in their assets for collecting the fish like what are we allowed to do then\n[laughter] they don't want us to do anything you know the story\nThat's nothing to do shark fisherman people were all open arms dealer to using that kid being the surfer getting out there in California is saying see this was happening all over the country because there's so many sharks fisherman drawn all the sharks in a minute\nThat's true because there's so many sharks fisherman drawn all the sharks in I mean it's such a scam yeah they have no\nRight I guess they go out and buy a thousand dollar butter or you know more than that\nBut you know you could point to go we go out there and I guess they just had put a stop to look at the fish I Can't do anything\n... and I tell you you know as I've said it for years that's all they're trying to do they just want to shut down one way or the other end of that thing\nAbout the ... like down in South Florida they didn't want to kill the ... even though they're taking over the ocean they don't want to kill the fish because the divers I Want to watch on the it's a pretty we can't kill 'em [laughter] and they're making money down there so they don't care that they get a pitcher eating all the fish so it's like ... what are we going to\nDo that may change they're talking about open season for mayor in Florida you do the yeah juice fish mhm yep so shaken I'd never seen one opened up the lid was weighed a hundred pounds or something like that and I'm Glad that I don't know I Would imagine you would\nDo\nWhat I think I got all that the whole thing that yeah oh good [laughter] still got a couple of more than ...\n... ... ... you need to get in there I think he said he's off to next fourteen days\nOh wow man that's a long time for him and I hope it will be on the radio saying\nThat you're gonna you're gonna get ready for flounder pounder right does then I got a good deal that weren't for\n[laughter] pretty much hair shirt [laughter] ship I'll be there [laughter]\nUh out later that either a ...\nOh you're going to give me the last ...

of wills have references to statutes and ... year old home state a lot of wills are not witnessed or notarized properly under Florida statute to make it what is called silk proving\nSo pro being in Florida it means that it's a witness to know the rise in a certain way with certain language and that would prevent tickets are done properly that would prevent ever having to find her locate the witnesses from your other state\nThere are a lotta times I see well done when you had minor children long many years ago in another state so you've named guardians for your children to now or are way

rules in certain percentages and some residents in the community can be under fifty five it just it really depends on the circumstances but if you have a question about that or any other area of law\nA lot of the questions I again about estate planning or who should be the personal representative or a trustee of the Willard trust\nShould it be family members should it be a professional should it be corporate like banks attorney CPAs who should be who should handle the estate we know everything leaves a little different\nAnd in most cases there can be a different answer just based on circumstances if you have a very is due to children that all get along\nAnd you want to treat them equally in the distribution like fifty fifty outright just give it to him no matter what the value size of it is you just like for them to have because you know they can handle it well then you might choose them as the personal represent interesting\nNodded she signs of el ... she waves the rights

could do it in writing cannot be learning how to kind of verbal because\nThe landlord now on that and I'm\nTotally should be in writing and hiring\nEach month to month without a leash so you basically have and have to be served in the first of the month or a ... or the like the thirtieth of the previous month do need to be out that month they served in the middle of the month and you get the rest of the month in and then another ... a month\nOr\nSo at least ... today for example you have to you'd be able to stay there in October and you have to be able to the end of November\nOh okay
