B. will be a lot to go after today and we will get to it so the FBI report came out yesterday what do we learn\nWell even the Democrats admit that within the FBI report they couldn't have been dispute any cooperation Fox News media buzz Howard Kurtz\nAbsolutely nothing that happened yesterday on the cabinet investigation that surprised me that shocked me that stunned me in any way shape or form it was all orderly predictable\nSo this whole thing with the FBI investigation or it was always pretty obvious to me that this was kind of a Hail Mary ah by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination and it was really unlikely to change the game for ... I guess in the ... FBI reached out to ten witnesses or potential witnesses interviewed\nNine of them and by all accounts the Democrats I'm not disputing this\nDidn't find anything to corroborate the sexual assault allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nYou hear that the Democrats are not disputing anything they're just claim it in an interview enough people\nYou know there are people that they want to see if we had a tall right\nThis is the question I Want I Want to go and just get to the phone calls I Want to open up the lines are like why do you believe and I already know my answer I Wonder what your answer is this has to do with getting a job working in the military or for the government\nWhy do you think there was a reason why they did not interview cabinet and or Christine for it sounds like a trick question there was a reason why\nIn the answer's very simple though it may sound confusing that troubles you talk tripled to eight to five five on the cabin I FBI report Dianne Feinstein says well you know it's it's not what was in the report is what was not in the report\nBut what I can say is it the most notable part of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview for Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview shock should lazy for\nWhat we heard from numerous people over the last few days seeking to provide information to the FBI we have seen even more press reports some witnesses who wanted to speak with the sci fi ... we're not interview\nDevore nearest his lawyer said he was unaware of any corroborating ... and I had the opportunity to read some but not all of it\nLooks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited perhaps by the White House I don't know\nPerhaps by the White House she doesn't know talking about a Hail Mary she says I haven't read the full report yeah but let me come out in\nFront of the cameras and tell you what I really really think but yet again sexual assault all of this of course the aftermath and the FBI report again do show any cooperation women from the view says if you're a powerful man and guess what you can group a woman and get away with it and I\nSat outlet suing for men women and [noise]\nIf you become a powerful man you are allowed to grow up and want to look at the president hey\nWhat can I stop what powerful position was Brett Kavanaugh back when he was Seventeen even if he grows to female yeah what was the power I don't know whether humans captain of the football team kept capital of the debate club at school yeah you know he was kept her a little bit it's play a beer pong they you know\nSo when you're famous you can do it they let me tell you no matter where you\nKnow and now now that I don't believe me senators\nDon't care about their daughters they're paying for political purposes to push like\nNot just a bad message to the mouse and women of view\nYou know I don't think that's a fair statement you know and I like to get people to benefit about let me look at what she's saying if you're a powerful man you can wrote women to get away with the list that\nThey they would have not let him get away with it if the people that Dr Ford said we're in the party if they cooperated none of them set that anything happened to be where you've been there and they don't remember the event you have to have witnesses to to to back up\nTheir ... can I just asked the question what is the difference between number two in charge the deans you Keith Ellison and we're the lady I actually went to a hospital show certain things that took happen he admits calling her to be word but then again if you throw ice and you call somebody or whatever or that you know a drunk\nWith Brett Kavanaugh ... automatically qualify him it from coming Supreme Court nominee pictures\nOf the woman with a black guy all over the Internet indisputable fact this lady was beat the daylights out of by the now attorney general lack of the state of Minnesota\nSlowly and they want it yeah and he got it okay well not so bad but by the way talking about a black guy out of all of this give me a group who's probably really didn't have a black guy\nHe would you say the Democrats maybe do ya how about the media NBC News Megan Kelly\nAbout the media because what we're seeing right now is that the latest poll showed that the Democrats have overplay their hand and this whole thing um that that the polls show\nThis year she said that that article surprising in a widespread surge in GOP butter enthusiasm standing largely for support for Canada\nHuh Josh house for eight and McConnell for the cabinet debate has dropped a political grenade in the middle of an electorate that had been largely lock and Democrats favor for the past six months to an NPR poll just out by the why democratic and\nAnd the credit favor for the past six months an NPR poll just out by the why democratic enthusiasm advantage that had to find a campaign to dominate the metrics that his point had disappeared and I would submit to you if it's in part because of what we've seen that we've seen the Democrats try to maneuver Dr Ford\nAnd others as political weapons and thought on the media whoever right on with its workforce and even five cross examined ... about this\nQuaint and discredited third accuse that\nFord is one thing but the pie aligned and reporting about you know hand throwing ice and hand calling his Eighteen year old buddies a bunch of drunk as though it's like\nYou know she brought up something to do is end up backfiring there was a merit St Paul NBC usually at the M. A. R. I. S. T. usually which is cooperate with NBC News released I think on Wednesday eighty three percent of Republican women claim that the mid term elections are very important\nAnd yet that's how they can to to look for more before we get to the phones or triple to talk and I like to ask\nYou why do you think Amazon Amazon here locally remember they were when they were hiring especially losing the black community do early or bragging about wanting to get people going about Fifteen bucks an hour yes and and nobody in Florida I mean they need you a minimum wage was going to pass but why do you think Amazon wanted to go down that route because they wanted to get good workers\nWho exactly the higher you pay people you get what you pay for their more industrious bill a bill in in some cases people don't make it a lot of money or do a good job for the lord but uh many cases they uh they do it because they get paid well and they want to keep their jobs\nTripled to talk triple to eight to five five before we get to I Want to get the phones with Rick and just a moment we'll start off with Iraq but let me out to play one last clip as you know the holidays are coming up\nAnd every time it is the season they'll fight for Fifteen union rally here's one from one of the union or wraps Bridgette Hughes who says that groups like the fast food places listen to this clip folks and we're going to your calls in a moment she says at the fast food places need to start paying Fifteen bucks an hour [noise]\nHoller\nFor racial equality we need to go to the political on them against [noise] why oh why oh why oh\nWhy oh\nMan I mean I was looking for another is is there\nSomething that doesn't sound too\nWell here's a question before we get to the phones it tripled to ... to eight to five five are they now and see now I mean those are union reps right there are they insinuating that you're not getting Fifteen dollars an hour because based on racism or because you're gay oh yeah [laughter]\nThat's my head I do not making this up you played the flip side though I have somebody on things that I get let's go to the phones I Love to hear from you this morning on his whole minimum wage they posted by the way you Andrew Gillum believes that it\nShould start off at Fifteen bucks an hour and they want to do it as a constitutional amendment and pass it within one year not not not in you know it uh what's the word from Italy come in they had done like that and let's go to Rick hey Rick good morning run W. B. O. B.\nShe left out of\nThe Amazon the day after they announced the dollars and now that they would do away with their their bogus program called for productivity\nWorkers do a good job or no longer going to get a bonus over\nSo we're going to ask them or service to the Amazon which is great but it's all you know every ... every morning\nAnd every one\nAnd I'm Sorry you're going to court for the different stuff right then you should be able to match right but but the thing with Amazon is going to watch for what I understand from some of the funny shows\nAmazon's just getting out of it could actually increase the bottom line\nMath hey Rick have a good morning I'm ... let's go to Bruce Bruce good morning you're on WB obey\n[noise] hey how you doing I got I uh I got a comment about Amazon and McDonald's have you done yeah go ahead I Want to hear it okay so for Amazon there are also doing away with stock options that are out so you know that's how like all the Home Depot and uh\nUh some other companies you know people got rich but stock options in companies\nThat got ... got became millionaires in some cases Oh yes yeah I Know a few of them anyway as far as McDonalds goes\nLike Donald as a corporation may be making billions of dollars but McDonald's franchise companies stats right\nCorporation may be making billions of dollars but McDonald's franchise companies stats right when they yeah and and they needed the individuals all have the right thing to kind of pay for their area and as far as the racism or goes\nI don't know if this is true across the board but I find and I think it's really great as far as like a little goes I find that most all the McDonald's I go in our managed by black bugs\nAnd owned by them and so to the cold is a racist thing is kind of like a I don't know all over the over the top in my opinion um I think it's strictly economic\nHey Bruce actor Bruce yeah can I mean I agree with you to point is a former economics editor let me totally I mean you really said something that I was going to get to but thank you for mentioning\nA lot of McDonald's franchise zone\nWhich means they still have to deal with some of the regulation as far as advertising but they have their own budget it's not like it they go into the red they get a ... a lot of money for McDonald's\nAnd as a franchise owner bruise would you kind of alluded to you they are limited to what they can pay per hour based on the profitability that comes into their local store because it's not corporate anymore you're exactly correct\nAnd it's very misleading to say that it's a billion billion dollar company that's not in people with it that's my main point I guess\nYou know you you nailed it I'm Glad you said hey have a good week he's exactly right and what people are not folks when you were a franchise owner you you own it not McDonalds anymore I mean you still have to deal with the regulations\nYou pay you pay McDonald's a quarterly feet to the store and\nAnd let's look as and Bruce is exactly right if it's corporate the corporation like Amazon and can afford to do it but even as he said Amazon is still going to find a way to pay for the second according to Yahoo News\nThat he will do for a direct stock purchase plan and their stock options will be reduced in order to pay for that minimum wage to all of you out there that may not understand math to some of the liberals out there\nIt's not like the ... it's not like they have a Federal Reserve that can just pop the money and to put it in directly to the company ... ... the business a business he's not
