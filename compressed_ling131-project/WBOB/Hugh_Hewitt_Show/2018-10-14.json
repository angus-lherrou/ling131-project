A. T. H.\nIt's a well known city and gas is the place with spies referred to when they returned to Moses with an evil report about the promised land you remember the promised land and they came back and they said they were all kinds of giants in there and they were talking about yeah\nIt was in gas according to the young believing spies giants existed and these giant sore so huge that next to them the spices and they fought like\nGrasshoppers that's work life came from he came from guy\nHow big was the well ever Samuel Seventeen for we're told that he went out from the campus the fullest scenes from guy and his high was six months and the span now most of us don't measure things into but sports fans so let me translate that for you [noise]\nDuring a time when the average man's high was about five feet tall the measurement of the Goliath was well he was somewhere between nine foot six and nine foot nine he was a huge man probably way in between four and five hundred thousand [noise]\nThe side of your life or something you could never forget for Samuel says she had a bronze helmet on his head\nHe was armed with a coat of a male the weight of the cold was five thousand shovels her bronze he had bronze armor on his legs of bronze jab all in between his shoulders and the staff of his fear was like a waivers being and his iron spirit headway six hundred shackles kind of ... when before here\nI mean to make matters worse the Bible says he doesn't\nCome out into this valley once a day with his strip the Bible says he came twice every day for six weeks and stood in the valley and shouted out his challenge\nTo the cowardly Israelites\nIt could you imagine what it would be like to hear a nine foot six inches giant shout I'm sure it was like that car that came up next to you at the light the other day with a boom box in the back [noise]\nI'm sure his voice reverberated all over here is what the scripture says\nGoliath stood and cried out to the armies of Israel and said to them why you come out to line up for battle am I not a\n... and use the service of Saul choose a man for yourself and\nMight not a ... and you the servants of Saul choose demand for yourself and let him come down to me if he's able to fight with me and kill me then we will be your service but if I were a veil against him and kill him then you show me are servants and serve us\nAnd the ... said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together\n\nWell he roared long and loud WWE heard on both sides of the plane he didn't need a microphone or a megaphone\nHe had a voice that was the size of his body and not one man among the Israelites could bring himself even the answer [noise]\nSingle combat back then was very common thing because they kind of came up with this idea why should we wipe out the enemy and lose all those potential servants\nSo the ... wanted to settle the fight economically each side sent one man to fight these two men would fight to death and the winters nation would be declared victorious and the losers nation would be a slave and brutalized by the enemy\nSo that was the over commerce challenged just think about ... get a good picture in your mind this gigantic brutal man standing in the valley of the law between the stands on both sides\nNow the overcome or character is going to take some kind of warrior to face Goliath and nobody and\nSolves army was prepared to accept a job but here comes a day to\nDay but it was the youngest son of Jesse Jesse had age sons as you remember and David had been anointed by the prophet Samuel as the next king of Israel he'd been annoyed and many folks don't know this but they never became the king until Fifteen Years after he was annoyed at\nHis time for a rule had not yet come and he was still living at home with his dad he was taking care of the sheep his three older brothers as we learn from the scripture had already gone to the war they were standing with the Israeli Army over I'm at one hill\nAnd one day Jesse came to his young son David and he says I Want you to go check on your brothers\nAnd I want you to take them and they're captains some food some provisions he's your wife's father he wanted to then sure his sons had food and he also wanted to take care of their kept him and he wanted to make sure that anything that they needed they would have [noise]\nThe sad fact is we can always count on those we look to for support in fact sometimes all we can count on them doing is mocking us are undermining us instead of encouraging and standing behind us\nI just want to tell your friends when you want to do something great for God get ready for your brothers and sisters to give you all the reasons why you should fail\nOften the criticism comes from those who don't have the courage to accept the challenge themselves they're thinking seems to me if they're not going to succeed they don't want anyone else to succeed either [noise]\nReally prepared for this challenge don't let the defensiveness resentment jealousy or anger of others deflect you from your purpose no matter how good your idea or goal is don't expect others to immediately agree with your purpose or vision you have to be determined enough\nTo fight your own battle if they try to talk you out of it you just keep going somebody said\nIf everything that you feel like God has asked you to do makes logical sense it's probably not God you're listening to [noise]\nI mean it makes no sense for a five foot guy to go out and tackling nine foot six giant what God told David to do it and he did it his brothers the king of Israel all try to talk him down and he wouldn't let it stand in his way\nI'm just telling you I've been around for a while had a few projects on my list I've never had one that somebody didn't come and say to me you're going to do what [noise] and then they'll tell me all the reasons why won't work\nIt's come to the place now if that doesn't happen I must not be doing God's will [laughter] and and that's kinda the way it is isn't it\nDon't let your friends talk you out of God's purpose for your life number to re enforce your focus on God if you study the story carefully you will come up with some very interesting observations\nIt's All right to talk to God about your problems but sometimes you need to talk to your problems about God [noise]\nPrefer the goodness of God to them [noise] prophecy the promises have gone to them proclaimed\nThe victory of the cross to them puts your problems in perspective and then\nGo when the fight [noise]\nRefuse to be discouraged by friends reinforce your focus\nOn God and then like this to him reflect on your previous victories and all of us have some victories in the past we walk with God for one day we got a few listen to what David did solve could have refused to allow day but the ... I mean there was a lot at stake for him [noise]\nSo could have refused to allow David to fight your lives I mean there was a lot at stake for him but David convinced him and he convinced him by telling him this story he recalled his previous victories not to brag but to establish his ... right to go\nFight here's what David said and versus thirty four two thirty seven Davis said is all your serve it used to keep his father sheep and went to lie and bought a barricade and took a lamb out of the flock I went out after it and struck it and delivered the lam from its mouth and when it erodes against me I caught it by its beard and struck and killed in\nYour survey has killed both the lion and the bear and based on circumcised ... will be like one of them see here's the by the armies of the living God and moreover David said the lord who delivered me from the ... the lion and the fall of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this village team\nTo put this in NFL terms [noise]\nIf you beat in the lions and you'll be in the bears you don't have anything to worry about from the giants\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] they ...\nThey scream I Can't do this instead he said that God had been on his side in the past he said\nLet me give you my resume here let me tell you how he quipped I Am to go fight this giant and so he gave us all a victory of his past accomplishments and men and\nWomen I Need to tell you we need to do the same thing we need to understand that God has been on our side has it not God has helped us in the past God has shown us his presidential help\nIf we just remember that it helps us I remember reading somewhere someone said if you have never had a test you can't have a testimony [laughter] [noise]\nSo don't be discouraged by your friends when you're in the process of overcoming\nReinforce your focus\nOn God and make sure your seat guard a lot bigger than your problems you know when the Israelites were\nSpying out the land from cage Barney and the spies came back and only two of them believe that God could take them to victory you know what the problem was that can who didn't believe they saw themselves in light of the giants but\nJoshua and cannot solve themselves and the giants in light of God and it made all the difference in the world it's where you put your perspective you know I might not be able to do this by compared to what's going on in the world but I have a God I have a great God God always wins [laughter]\n[noise] okay\nHere's the fourth one and this is one I Love run towards your problems not away from them [noise] the\nBible says that when ... started toward David David ran toward the life I mean it takes a lot of guts to run toward a nine foot six giant\n[noise] he ran toward them\nLet me tell you what I've learned from this you guys your problems aren't going to go away\nI mean every morning for six weeks and every evening for six weeks ago I showed up how many of you know if you've got problems they show up [noise]\nI keep thinking one of these days I'm going to pray and God's gonna make my problems go away but he doesn't do that [noise]\nI get in some terrible situations because we have five hundred and some people that work for some of these organizations and I took some or the other day it seems like somebody among those five hundred is always in trouble about something and we're trying to figure out what to do how to do it right and if you knew the truth you know what to do but how do you know the truth [noise]\nBut I Want to tell you something I've learned problems don't go away so you might as well deal with them as soon as they pop up [noise]\nGo I wasn't going to go away he was coming every morning and every night how many of you know problems are usually harder in the morning and then I I that's what you think about in the first moment so bureau wakefulness and usually it's what you think about before you fall asleep if you do [noise]\nBut if you face your problems down if you run toward them whenever they are family problems were placed problems financial problems when you\nCan't figure out the answers you may worry did anxious and lose sleep and as I mentioned there's two times during the day when that happens so it was with a foolish things Rosen came a junior to meet David that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet\nThe full steam so how do you overcome your problems the\nStory of David tells you how to run towards your problems embraced and confront them don't postponed them don't ignore them don't try to work around them don't try to push them over on somebody else below them kind of front them face to face head on\nAnd watch God go to work and your rehab [noise] problems don't go away\nBut God can deal with that if we put them in his hands [noise] finally when you're running Georgia problems be sure to remember for whom you are fighting\nDavid said you came to me with a sword and with his beard and with the ... but\nI come to you and the name of the lord a post all this assembly show no that the lord does not say what sort in spirit for the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands what a difference it would make if you and I faced all of our challenges like David did\nIf we said lord for your honor and for your glory I'm going to do the right thing and I'm going to face my battles in the power of your name and I'm going to trust you to help me overcome the giants in my life [noise]\nAnd the messages that are in this book and that I'm preaching all ten of them you'll find the strategy of the overcome or explained you find the path there'll be overcome are laid out for you you'll discover what happens when you were a member for whom you are fighting\nChange can be harder and new habits are most easily acquired when there's great reward waiting for you let me tell you what's waiting for us the Bible says in revelation Twenty one seven he who overcomes shall inherit all things\nWere called to be over ... men and women were called to walk and victory and strength and peace and love sometimes I hear\nPeople say when I asked them how they're doing I'm doing okay down under the circumstances but we don't belong under the circumstances we belong above the circumstances were not under comers were over commerce\n[noise] and the Bible\nSays it this way [noise] and all these things we are more than conquerors threw him who loved us God is not partial to David what he did for a day but he'll do for us I don't know what your giant is I got a few of my life\nBut none of those giants intimidate the God of heaven and none of those giants can defeat you if you stand in the strength of the lord God as soon as we go through all of these things that we're going to learn were going to see how almighty God helps to overcome our weakness with strength\nOvercome or anxiety was peace overcome\nHas been defeated the grave was been swallowed up and victory Jesus abolish the death for the believers\nHe put an end to it now when we die we can we can say like Paul ... from the body needs to be present the lord he looked at that the phone to crawl said this day you'll be with me in paradise now how can I mean that recalls that man was this the but the calls\nHe frustrated a Lord Jesus Christ death was put out an end for that man\nHe was there for as as his soul left his body heat was transported from there to paradise with God he didn't have to feel the same of death but calls up his belief in the Lord Jesus Christ\nJesus abolished death he finalize it he put an end to any one victory over it for you and I today I don't have to fear what comes after the great there are some folks today that are so afraid of what's going to happen when they die\nThere are so afraid of what's coming on the other side and one thing is going to be but for the child of God we don't have to fear what they're going to be we don't have to fear how this thing's going to work out because of Jesus put an\nAd in the end on the gross he finalized in\nThe end of life for I Believe or is the beginning of a live from the presence of God Almighty\nHe abolish the death on the crawls when he cried any finish that was the end of it folks he put the enemy in its place all of our new all of heaven knew that the debt was paid that the ... mission for San was paid for with the life of the precious a lamb of God\nThis morning death is finished sand is finished all the crawls book cause of Jesus Christ he's finished today\nSo the the the word that we have for the center this morning the word that we have for those that are born again when we talk about death we don't have to fear that they don't have to feel sick this you don't have to fear disease you don't have to fear the things that come against you because we know that at the end of this road we're going to stand before the one who\nGave his ally for us and we're going to see 'em face to face\nThis is not the end but just the beginning this is just the beginning of things that are the time we have a glorious hope for the future with cries so we have a problem is that we turn all live with him he's laying up pressure on the other side for us but policies abolish death\nIt's none of staying mentally after fear anymore but calls Jesus Jesus paid at all\nLet's move on here let's re first Corinthians give me a moment while I turned their first Corinthians\nNow listen to me this morning a Jesus finished death but here first Corinthians chapter Fifteen I'm going to read a couple of the versus here first Corinthians Fifteen [noise] let's start inverse number fifty six\nSays the sting of death is said and a string of CNN\nIs the law were fifty five I like it it says called death wherever is die staying grave worry is diabetic three this thing of death sand and\nThe strength of Santa is the law but thanks be to God which give us a victory throw\nOur Lord Jesus Christ we saw in second Timothy where Jesus defeated death\nNow we read and first Corinthians word Jesus defeated sand all across now why is that important for the believer today because before Christ died there was no remission for sand not only were mission firsthand there was no power for us to live up above sand\nThere was no power for us to be sent to five\nAnd Clinton's from sin but the word of God says here that gene that Jesus he abolish Sammy abolished down all deaths worry and start saying oh brave where is the big three were for the seven says but thanks God which give it does to victory\nThrough our Lord Jesus Christ because of Jesus taking sand or the crawls mailing sit on the growth St bearing in a sense of the world on his shoulders when he cried\nOut to the father in his finished whenever the last breath left his lungs whenever his spirit was transported up to the habit with God listening it was saying is that very moment\nSand had lost his power death\nLast ditch Graham now we operate in the supernatural
