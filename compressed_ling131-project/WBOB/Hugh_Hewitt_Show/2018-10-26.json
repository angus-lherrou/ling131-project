I read\nThe sheet before as a as a preparation but it's still a re read everything\nUnless you're very familiar with all this jargon and political jargon you're going to end up being confused you might be voting against their own interests without knowing just because it's meant to mislead\nYou I I think a lot of it's meant to mislaid and Roger one did you say the other day when it when you don't know you vote no that is actually you know is that double redundancy a you know different know K it'll double ... now now what do you have\nA job in a way we're going to have ... and coming up and just a little bit a pure for one hour on the constitutional measures the pros and cons some would say we'll get all of that in just a little bit big news and hit this past week according to the Associated Press and wait to you hear this clip\nThirty eight elected for the sheriff's here in the state have called on Democrats are given a toilet candidate Andrew Gillum to withdraw its support for radical organization called ... what's the name of this group it's a freedom pledge what does it does freedom pledge to defend their freedom\nFreedom or southern recall yeah one of these groups out there that dream defend joined defenders exactly\nSo the letter for Gillum they share breeds quote after learning of this organization is disturbing and anti law enforcement position we believe that any candidate wishing to lead our states should not be aligned with this radical group the pledge calls for you to the fund police\nPresence and they say that police court or never meant to protect and serve you instead but this is what this was the pledge that police and prisons have no place in justice in fact\nPolice and prisons aren't just races they\nWork to enforce the separation of rich and poor or it gets better they said also they started at ... catchers hired by wealthy plantation owners\nI'm just I'm speechless you know who yeah who is going to protect people when they were being victimized by criminals ... do you call nine one one who do you want to show up the freedom of defenders of the law\nRoger Waite you hear this Andrew Gillum was on the Washington Free beacon podcast he says quote we're going to play the clip for you right now that we've you pull out your gun\nYour baton do we still the times but John's or tasers in the line of duty you have gone too far clip number one\nThat navigating my the fact that they think I'm you know break the law and all this other stuff that they say God Knows I don't want to get life to it but\nThat's that's what they say um I've got to let them know I I only know Elise accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement job as a hobby for a relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement\nOfficial has to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser and they have already have to go too far by their very presence very trusting the\nFire and community and in society is supposed to be able to bring most situations when I'm In favor of repairing the breach making sure that there is a community relations\nShit I you know what your community relationships by all means you know I've been in the butt but is there but is there a way to ... I get I may ask it out there is there a way to spend\nThis I mean it's just it's just this connotation that police will just walking around like one of the John Wayne mood at I'm willing to his job pilgrim walking around with with their guns out in the open the times just hitting them against their hand I mean how do you spend that\nMost people are unaware that the police have very very strict rules and when they can pull a gun out the the reason why they carry a pepper spray and tasers stretched to save the lives of criminals to be perfectly Frank with you\nIt's called less than leave lethal weapons and they're there to you know keep a situation under control without having to resort to look like they don't want to ... days I think if they have pulled a gun out that's because the other guy put out a gun first or not fit and by the white and the reason\nThat's in by the way can without going into logistics Rajani you covered that they do teach you it I'm a concealed weapons permit holders they only ... and I took the classes\nAre there they do teach you it I'm a concealed weapons permit holders they always it and I took the classes they teach you you better be thinking before you do this\nLet me tell you something I don't care whether it's um you know Daryl Daniels in clay county ... I'm ... and some of the other ones here chair Michael instead of Jacksonville or the ... Orange County they will tell you\nPlease think before you pull your gun because there are a lot of ramifications also personal ramifications that may be with you at work\nRight at the with the police department eternal affairs bats a police department with Anna police department their sole job is to be the police department for other law enforcement officials trust me if they're pulled a gun out its reason for it so\nSo I mean again I'm just so let me look argument's sake let's say I'm trying to give a leeway forget which I'm not but Roger is what she said that's an edited did ... is there any way that this could be spent in his favor or do you think that there were trying to say\nVoted for legislation that would have thrown people with preexisting conditions out of their health plan to progress not only would that problem went bankrupt the country that's a double tax for eight\nDays talking about the the Medicare for all here's a question Republicans seem to be backtracking on some of the issues with Obamacare this\nIs a very interesting question do you have a ... ... what is it Roger sixty maybe up to eighty depending on the majority of Americans will just put it that way the ... group health insurance plans or a couple of pre existing condition exactly they already exist\nSo we know the debate is not whether\nThe costs are going to go up costs to always go up costs for vehicles go up costs for food everyday cost for insurance but it's out the rate is done faster when you look at the deductible under Obamacare when you look at the premiums in price when you look at how became a monopoly and now you've got maybe one or two in your area that they put you on to affordability when it comes in covers with Obamacare\nThe question is if there's costs going up is it because of the free market or is it because a lot of times\nThe government gets involved if the government comes in and tells you you gotta have prenatal care you've got to cover all of a you know contraception at Seventy years old you are going to cover this you gotta covered that NPR existing conditions will listen if the insurance companies are going to pay more out ... gets what they've got to do they've got the charge more\nBut here's the thing though you know I I I ... might have on my insurance plan you know a prenatal care I'm not going to have a baby anytime soon that's a service that I'm never going to you you still got to pay for that well I'm I'm not paying paying if you're getting\nA plan with Obamacare you got a job or to your show the cafeteria okay under Obamacare you've got to pay for that\nOkay I just don't see how that's going to create a liability for the insurance company go 'cause I'll never have to use that claim\nThey'll but here's the point it's part of the liability which means it's part of a mandate okay so which means that if that is so they got to pay for it they're gonna still tax\nYou no matter what and I agree with you you shouldn't have to pay for that or windfall for the insurance companies for sure but here's the thing remember that if they are paying for other people that cannot afford it you know even though you don't need the preventive care your money's going for the people who already happening though at the emergency rooms you show up airport talk we're about we're talking regular plants will see your doctor I'm Sorry I listen\nWe're talking about a one on one visit your doctor talking about going emerges okay All right yeah\nSo the question is should the government\nIn the business of telling insurance companies that they must cover pre existing conditions that is a big debate here's another big debate going on the caravan oh how many days are these people on the news\nOut because of the hurricane that were set up their way will I think it was called Julian\nTurner from Fox News or you're ready for this study that's come out for Roger I was fascinated when I heard the story today that\nThe the area when it comes to um customs says it a lot of the people that are coming over to quote seek political asylum are coming over to seek political asylum it's a fraud becoming over whether you agree with the not with each just based on the economic opportunity\nOn security officials also stressed the keeping of asylum seekers out in the U.S when the ... border isn't difficult\nWhen the caravan arrive its members have what's known as the credible fear accounts they got to demonstrate their reasons for not wanting to return to their home country are legitimate\nAccording to US Customs and immigration enforcement quote the extremely low bar for establishing credible fear is ripe for fraud and abuse\nOr asylum systems being exploited by those simply seeking economic opportunity not those fleeing persecution exacerbating crisis after crisis at our southern border and keeping those who truly need asylum in the back of the line and the numbers are down the past decade him seen an experiential certain people claiming credible fear\nIt jumped from five percent of migrants entering the U.S in two thousand six thirty nine percent in twenty sixteen [laughter]\nAtlanta and fish will say this high percentage is thanks to a good organization and planning on the part of the care of and they say these days migrants arrive prepared and oftentimes while we're her somehow to reach that credible fair threshold\nGod interesting so whether or not the economic opportunities to make a better mood for their lives or to get on the governor Dole ... that is an interesting debate right there but the bottom line is they're not seeking political refugee anybody can claim that\nThey're claiming political or if you just say let's come up with a list of countries who receive U.S foreign aid and lets them up say okay you're going to be assigned to whatever all seven\nWho receive U.S foreign aid and lets them up say okay you're going to be assigned to whatever all seven continents involved they don't necessarily end up um in America they find out by a lottery system when they get here\nFive and we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented\nCircumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully become immersed in this country\nSo what are they just say it was it it was wrong for people to come over here legally that was President Obama two thousand five what's changed well we have a new president [laughter]\nSomebody new to blame Roger the second quarter let's get some economic news the second quarter GDP Growth rate a four point two percent the strongest instead of\nA quarter of ... I think the Sacramento is yeah the second quarter of two thousand fourteen but according to the bureau of economic analysis the GDP now\nOf the third quarter which probably won't be released for about maybe another couple of months a year according to the Federal Reserve bank of Atlanta it's estimation maybe not at four percent but maybe three point six Stuart ... from the Fox business news was having maybe a little bit of fun with Trump economic\nAdvisor Kevin Hassett that wait a second we were told five six percent now it's going to maybe be around three and we get\nThe first reading a third quarter GDP economic growth looks like it's going to be in the three percent range we've talked about this before a cat and I think that's disappointing tell me why it loss disappointing\nNo remember and twenty sixteen economic growth was at one point six percent and everybody told us we're in this new normal we're going to grow around one percent forever for internal modeling say that it's going to be about three and a half but it could be what are the\nFour but three and a half I think it's probably a good candidate right now we're in here but that's the way that you know that's more than double a growth rate that President Trump inherited that's pretty good news right\n... ... ... ... we were told that when we get the tax cuts and we got the tax cuts would look it up four and five percent growth\nNo we were told that we would get three percent growth if you look at our budget forecast that assume the tax cuts last year and then we average like three point one her three over the next ten years and more importantly we said that capital spending with boom by going up about ten percent this year over the first half of the year because of the tax cuts capital spending went up about ten percent\nAnd you know we got the advance terrible this data that shows us that and the third quarter it's going to be about ten percent as well so we've got a sustained capital spending boom and that gives you a sustained growth because what could happen now is all those new factories are gonna start producing output and queue for an ... one of them share\nThat now that list and there were a lot of people that were hyping some maybe from the Trump crowd that quite a bit never got high five maybe six percent and some of these I think it would hurt a little bit is the interest rates what House you can also this trade war ...\nGoing to be causing um the tariffs on imports\nYeah so I think that has a lot to deal with that we'll continue to move along the latest Sunday voting numbers out there may benefit Republicans may be benefiting the Democrats and will continue to companies more as we continue to move along talk radio W.

other\nMilitary is any break below with the FBI I don't know who knows\n[laughter] let me say God Knows I don't want to get life to it but\nThat's that's what they say [noise] um I've got to let them know I I only know Elise accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly\nLaw enforcement John doesn't have a relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time to a taser and they have already have to go too far by their very presence\nVery trusting the fire and community in a society\nIs supposed to be able to bring most situations\nWhen I'm In favor of repairing the breach making sure that there is a community\nReally laughing at him and said you had a crazy guy with a gun and the police officers for like\nA guy you know I'm nice I like you you have to wait let me give you credit you put your done gone down because we like each other that's not what's gonna happen to\nBe the police department they're under very strict training and rules and when they can bring out a gun the reason they carry pepper spray the reason they carry tasers is to save the lives of criminals those suspected of being cry that don't have the escalates to ever got out there is a reason for it and it's not because they just want to you know be middle Mr cowboy\nYou know here's a question I Would ask of the ... forget forget Ron disasters forget or just forget about whether or not some ad was out there but some some stupid white supremacist group out there out of what Idaho who knows or a high or whatever the earth's from talk about this issue Roger the question I Would like to ask\nIs that wait a second if they pull out their ... their taser for crying out loud and then they'd gone too far in the line of duty been what are they supposed to use harsh language maybe a little bit of mace who did they put a seriously what are they supposed to use that\nIf someone has a gun they're going to pull a gun out of someone has a life that's when the going gets pulled out if it just arguing or the person who's involved in maybe a physical altercation they will they will pull to God at that point it they'll they'll use less lethal weapons at that point to\nMake sure that the person who's actually engaged was criminal activity isn't hurt more than they need to be\nWhen it comes to the early voting I Know the Republicans are out there talking about the big spread that they may have that spread may well may be made up by the Democrats when it comes to the as you know the early voting Roger abs and tea is is technically early voting\nOkay when compared to the day of election there's three rounds absentee than the early voting which you go to the polls early and absentee used by mail absentee by mail early about which is what I Do usually on a Sunday after church or whatever it as opposed at the library Ryan's elaborate a park or senior citizen center\nAnd the day of elections you know and many minutes the ... the majority of votes that take place\nHave been on the table action okay but the Republicans are out there saying that the early voting the absentee has been betting putting them heavily and there is no turnaround for the Democrats yet\nThe numbers show in a little bit different there is a big percentage especially among Democrats districts in South Florida the first day of voting and two thousand fourteen was about sixty four hundred votes first day in two thousand Eighteen sixteen thousand\nDade the first day four thousand and eight hundred two thousand fourteen in two thousand Eighteen fifth teen thousand out there as you know the early voting tends to favor\nThat area the Democrats yes absolutely and uh you know the momentum is out there for the Democrats especially in the gubernatorial race I Believe I'll do it is picking up I Believe around the Sanders lately a recent poll them ever get who who were produced itself but its neck and neck maybe within one or two points within the margin of error yeah and the governor's race in\nSome of those in the ... the dissenting sorry but voting lines all throughout the state of Florida are long yeah and you know either long folks it's not because there's not enough polling places that's left what happy to say it's not because people cannot get their act together or maybe it is\nYou to have you on thanks for calling in\nMhm okay my opinion on this\nIs Roger that [laughter] yeah okay Liz ... really is the core as was liberty and justice for all our lipic he has been compromised I justice has been compromised\nAnd most of all the water all means everybody said that as liberty and justice for all born and unborn\nOkay I'm happy to say at the abortion issue on I was okay I had done that book how it's done counting on the situation like capital proved that they are so radically\nOn time life except when it comes to a specific group lending one I think all live monitors and blue lives lost her everybody's lives not\nIncluding the unborn and we do not protect citizens who are separated from office by piece of skin in tissue right\nAnd the woman and her future payers how can we have a good economy how can they have a good country constitution everything religious freedom everything\nAll right so here's the thing I Want to just kind of get to the point here I appreciate the call what I'm asking is and by the way that goes back to Nineteen Seventy three I'm Talking the last twenty five years\nWhat incident but I think she's got a point I think abortion has become a major divide here but the question is is I'm looking there was a couple of instances that I think could be contributed\nTo I get I does it matter where you Democrat Republican independent Green Party whatever they think you can pinpoint and say you know this might have been the beginning of the political divide up the rhetoric heavily pick it up\nI understand about the divorce rate rose my I don't do I think you get on with that one but I'm Talking about the last twenty five years give me a couple of instances that triple to talk tripled to eight to\nFive five or ... ... email address by the way you can

B.\nHey good morning or the last ... out of Iraq the springboard for my point um basically it's not necessarily like you got it from my understanding is actually a local control\nOr is it the state legislature that would regulate gambling 'cause if it's the state legislature and and and as always state legislature state legislature and the gambling a lobbyist already have the ability\nTo three that people put about ... on a on a amendments on the ballot to be able to change the constitution to expand gambling it's simply only limited to one option one option only should be able to uh make it harder for gambling to expand in Florida\nI don't read the ballot that way I mean I'm not I disagree with your premise out there I mean the state does regulate a lot of it right now but the question is is that you're allowed to have certain areas in your ... and ... no one's advocating it were just saying\nYou're allowed to have certain areas in your ... and ... no one's advocating it were just saying on the amendments Nathan that why would you want people in South Florida the majority boats dictate what happens up here in North Florida for a ... or ...\nWell it's the state legislature so it isn't directly the boat voters in Miami Dade and Tallahassee and all over Florida so it's basically the and like you said it costs less money to rule the legislature than it does to a change a amendment on the ballot\nYeah but there are other there are more votes they're more legislative voters outside of Tallahassee than there are inside I'm usually inside Miami\n[noise] no it's the legislature I meant the legislator legislative body of Tallahassee there are representatives for al ...\nFrom Miami Dade from all over the state so it's not necessarily home rule it's the it's the ... and and you know lobbyists to lobby it's easier to lobby I'm like a hundred and twenty\nA legislators than it is to lobby the entire state or gambling\nWell let's put it this way ... seminal suspend have spent and Disney spent over fifty million dollars to convince you that the no ... no competition is good and by the way seminal Indians are not regulated by state or the federal government they can pretty much do what\nThey can do what they want but the bottom of my well it's is it back and say well Miami already has control over this yeah but you realize when you look outside of maybe they're more state legislators then there are in Miami so correct\nIt's a population issue yeah so anybody is if you're in credit county or came with the candy and all of these candidates need to rebuild why can't they have a casino there and Miami ...\nJohn John good morning you're on WB obey\nThe morning before I say what amendment you change my mind on let me say this you mentioned earlier about the issues that divide the country I Believe one of the biggest ones that just happened with the Supreme Court approving gay marriage I still feel like a person without the country without having fast and the big division they see their family or religious belief\nThat caused a huge schism in our country\nHi well I think it was already had one before but go ahead\nBut one issue that you actually don't mind on this story simply because like you said a whole state of Florida shouldn't be dictated by one little group of people in a certain area or how they want the a ballot to be run or a gambling to occur\nI mean that's a great point I'm ... I'm just a bill ... my only question is the Tallahassee can do an up or down vote on this they don't need to put it on an amendment\n... I agree with you and by putting it on the amendment you again put the power into the hands of the people of South Florida because if they decided they don't want it what are they going to do they're going to vote in matching them so we're not going to happen anyway so the bottom line is they just ... ... again they circumvented\nLocal rule right and then the ... where are you going to a more mature and here's the other one on the other big amended amendment yeah I've got to keep a stranglehold on you guys here's the other one ah the what is it a memory\nFor that would put voters they the restoration for felons were ex felons within a time but it gives you a clue sex crimes include murderers once they served their time should they get their voting rights back Bill Carter no why not because\nThey have violated the trust of the American public the American public\nAh has has already gone are the ... the public uh Florida has already said OK you are a criminal you've been a convicted by one of course you have lost your show right now I get it that at some point there needs to be some restoration of sort of certain rights\nBut at the same time these people have not shown good judgment in their lives did they completely rehabilitate I don't like what do you think mass\nUh I think that yes there get out of jail is there a time frame and rich in which they have ... good citizenship and then you can restore it but that's not what it says that you've you've done your time you get to vote and I think a timeframe and which they have been contributing sip parts of the society then you can restored but All right hand ...\nMotivation to move along your calls were coming up next right here on TALK radio W.
