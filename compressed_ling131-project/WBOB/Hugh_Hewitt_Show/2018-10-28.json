don't answer your emails and I\nWill admit that I should write this down and your pictures out the little white flowering fine which has now taken over by law on um the reason that\nI didn't apply that their wait and see right away is because of the neighbor that at the same problems they just did that I put a vine out for 'em and then and\nThen at the weight and she said and I'm Wondering if that's a better option because the grass yesterday when I pulled out a whole bunch of it the grass underneath looks really really bad like it's been\nA gated probably suffocated right [noise] um and and these robots\nThat I've tried to get the main\nBut the little were really easy to pull out a lot of time short break off site to take a lot of care with taking it out but\nIt really is a choice

torpedoed hats other taped\nTo them as can be pretty heavily also uh you know how much do you have a lot\nA lot it's gotten more sense yes\nIt really uh you know you're you're in between of what to do I I mean you know I I don't know exactly what you had to I can guess it might be Florida ... creeping along that can be ... fine as does a little white well he's got a flower\nUh but uh I'm ... and get it out is probably important\nThat you can pull it out that would be fine otherwise I don't think we can do it to be honest with you you give them hell I don't either three out of the best crack at it is probably going to be the mayor product that because it has a herbicide pretty specifically the broad leaf we'd plants\nAnd the important thing would be if you do that make sure the ... the beliefs of the the we the grasses boys to when you do it so do the more I had to do or something like that or is that the views to bear products the it'll tell you on the label that that's the best way to do it\nThat's what I should point out that we eat for ... well if you can get to weed out ... that's probably going to be the best way um but you could do what you can do it doesn't hurt\nThere will be the best way um but you could do what you can do what made her put the mayor product down give it a try see if it works if it does fine if not then you'll have come back later pull it out and

B. O. B. you\nKnow what\nIt was a turning point weekend edition you're paid like all living things can grow so what are you doing to accomplish that day Dr David Jeremiah ... lives strategies to help make your brain bigger and better and stronger\nIntroduces message over coming here with me here's David\nAnd thank you for joining us today a today we're going to learn what it means to take the shield of faith and use it to ward off the dark side of the enemy who is coming at us with everything he has we're going to learn how to overcome fear with face\nAnd I hope you were with us for the next thirty minutes as we unpack this information together\nSo we come to this for the military implemented in this series of war things that we're talking about from efficient six and six sixteen here's what it says above all taped the shield of faith with which you will be able to clinch all the fiery ... of the wicked what [noise]\nSo and Paul wrote that he was describing a large shield\nA Roman infantry used to protect their whole bodies and you've probably seen movies about this or you've read about it the shields were four feet tall two and a half feet wide and they were made out of leather that was stretched over would they were reinforced with metal at the top and at the bottom\nAnd in ancient times enemy warriors would do the tips of their darts or arrows into a solution of lethal poison\nEven if these dogs only grazed the soldiers' skin the poison would spread through his bloodstream and he would be dead in a moment\nOn other occasions the enemy would give their darts in pitch and ignite them and shoot them into the Roman Catholic setting it on fire so having a shield to protect yourself from these dogs which came from outside was really critical and of all the implements warfare included in Paul's list\nIn fusion six this is the only piece that is given a specified purpose Paul tells us that the purpose of this shield the faith is to protect us from the fiery ...\nOf the wicked one\nAccording to New Testament scholar Peter O'Brian bees darts represent every kind of attack launched by the devil and his host against the people of God there as wide ranging as the insidious while is to\nPromote them they included every kind of temptation ungodly\nBehavior dial despair even ex journalist saw slight persecution or false teaching all of these regards to the enemy shifts at us and if you're a Christian\nThroughout your lifetime you will be bombarded by thousands of fiery arrows launched by Satan and his helpers and the only way to protect yourself is through face\nThe apostle Paul wrote it this way this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith\nSo how does face work how do we get faith how do we develop faith in our lives if we are to be filled with faces so we can overcome fear\nWe have to figure this out how to overcome fear\nSomewhat has said that faces an active practice bill to fund believe\nThe future's made real for men and women the faith faith is not ambiguous it's not I'm sure it's a concrete conviction sometimes you hear people talk about faith and you get the idea that sort of a hope so wished so kind of nebulous thing but they just like that at all faith is an attitude based upon fact\nBy faith we move forward even when we do not know what's ahead we take our faith from the word of God and we know the destination is clear face says that what God has promised is going to happen and it's so certain that it's almost as if it's already happened\nFace treats things that our whole for as a reality that's what he was eleven one means what it says faces the substance of things for for the evidence of things not seen\nYou may be among many of us who sometimes feels like your faith is kind of small\nBut Paul tells us that we don't have to be happy with our face where it is\nAnd the issue of our message is how do we increase our faith how do we grow our faith how can we find in the word of God the principles that will help us not have little Biddy faith what God wants us to have great faith\nI Know that faith can be increased because\nPaul look forward to the increase in the Corinthians safe sex\nPaul look forward to the increase in the current the unsafe second Corinthians to in the Bible says he longed to visit the believers in festival and I can watch this to strengthen what was lacking in their face\nAnd in his second letter to them he commended them for the growth in their face I don't know if I've ever heard this before but you know faith grows you can grow your face\nYour faith doesn't have to be small God wants our faith to grow and to be better than it is now so I Want to give you five strategies to help you grow your fate here's what the Bible says is necessary\nFor your face and my faith to grow that this first point is it self promotion it's just what the Bible says\nTo grow your face you need preaching\nYou say well past I expect you to do that because that's what you do but I'm not making this up this is right from the word of God the apostle Paul said stay comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God\nHe did not mean all who hear the word about become believers what he meant was that faith can exist unless there's a message or a report of facts and events that lead us to believe Paul was saying that are critical need and the life of a Christian is the hearing of God's word\nAnd this is really a powerful reason you guys to go to church on Sunday and especially if you go to a church where you hear the word\nThat's not true of every church but a lot of churches today you still hear the word of God when you go to church if you'd never sit under the sound of the word of God through preaching you are missing and important opportunity to grow your face\nThe Bible says faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God\nSo hearing the word of God spoke at and preached by others allows the scripture to reach you and fill you in an essential way sort of grow your face unique preaching or you pastors here I just did a shout out for you and your people need to come to church and here you preach so they can\nGrow their face number two this isn't as exciting to show your face you need problems [noise] I guess\nThat means all of us are candidates because we all got problems right [noise] none of us wants problems I mean I don't wake up in the morning and say lord God gave me some problems today\n[noise] what are you getting a little bit fake experience in your own\nYou can see that God\nIs up to something and you can trust him to grow our faith we need preaching and to grow our faith we need problems and the girl our faith we need people and the girl our faith we need purpose and perspective what perspective do we need\nTo decide who was asked users to increase their faith and Jesus to them if your faith is as small as the mustard seed you can approved and testimony Barry tree into the sea diver that preached on and miss applied many times\nIn other words Jesus was saying this it's not the size of your faith that counts it's the size of your God that counts Jesus disciples needed the proper perspective in order to grow their faith I get an object lesson on perspective whenever I drive my car\nWith power steering I can turn my two times automobile around with one finger now because my finger is that strong but because the power steering in my car is my finger just tax to engage the power and that accomplishes the task\nThat's how faith works lifestyle ministries founder Rhonda and said this way faith has to have an object to many people the important thing is to believe and what you believe is secondary I've had people say well I have to say what is your faith in Rogers\nEssay and it comes out their face to face and that's it they have faith in face they have\nThe notion that there is something mystical or magical in the mirror to believe in a sort of shows am best transforms mortals and the captain marvel\nBut the truth is faith has no power it is not fate that moves mountains is God biblical you speaking faith is a mere human activity it possesses no virtue holds no merit contains no power the power of faith in God\nSo don't sit around and saying well might say there's just no it's not your faith you just need to get a bigger God in your head and realize that God is able to do above and beyond all that you can ask her saying\n[noise] when I\nWitnessing um back when we started a church in Fort Wayne almost every night\nIcy uses illustration about faith because faith is really critical to somebody become a good Christian if they don't understand face they can't become a Christian so you have to work on and I have all kinds of course you will somebody gave me this little stretching narratives [noise] suppose you want to Minnesota in the wintertime to go ice fishing\nI Want to give you a question\nWould you rather have a little bit of faith and too\nShe would you rather have a little bit of faith and two feet of ice or a whole lot of faith\nIn in intro ice ice that question everywhere and you know the majority of people would say I think I should have a whole lot of faith and an inch of ice and I would write down don't ever go fishing with a\nGuy [noise] isn't that an interesting thing it is and how much faith we have is how secure the object of our faith is I'd rather have a little bit of faith and two feet of ice I feel secure doing now how 'bout you instead of having a whole lot of faith and the little tiny bit of you can get wet if you do that [noise]\nBut that's really the key that's the perspective we need let's not get all ginned up about how much faith\nWe have but let's talk about how much you God we have whether we trust in him [noise]\nAnd every once in awhile God does something that is so overwhelming and so unbelievable that are just build your face almost by hearing it and I remember when I read this story happened in Nineteen Ninety One and the build up of the U.S and coalition troops prior to the first Gulf War\nCharles crew lack of a U.S Marine Corps was responsible for providing logistical support for eighty thousand Marines that were moving into Kuwait\nAnd the site for their base was chosen because it was an old airfield that had the ability to provide a hundred thousand gallons of fresh water per day as it has been for centuries fighting in the desert succeeds or falls based on how much water you can find\nFourteen days before the war was to began the commander in chief of the American forces general Norman Schwarzkopf\nImplemented a new tactical plan of attack requiring a new base for the Marines in finding a new supply of water\nBut there was no water in this new location and for two weeks in general cruel I kept military engineers dig exploratory wells he quit the Saudi Government the Kuwaiti government local Bedouin tribes and nomads\nHas to any available supplies of water in this new relocation and the answer was the same from everybody there is no water here\nWell ... was a committed Christian and he prayed and its devotional time for God to provide water for his troops on the Sunday before the invasion cruel I was called out of a chapel service by one of his staff officers who needed to show 'em something\nSo they drove down this road that cruel ex Marines had built a road he'd driven down at least Seventy times a road where at least sixty thousand Marines had passed and stopped\nHis officer directed ascension to a spot twenty yards up the roadside where he saw something new a Fifteen foot tall pipe with two large poses connected at the top\nAt the bottom was this giant diesel engine a pump and a five hundred gallon tank filled with diesel fuel\nThey walk to the spot incredulous that what they were seeing cruel I pushed the diesel engines on button and it brought to life shooting water out of the two hoses his men measured the discharge rate of the water one hundred thousand gallons a day exactly what the army needed\nThem raised it and use diesel quit but they had no diesel fuel cruel I had no idea how the well the pump the fuel had materialized exactly the right time providing exactly the right amount of water\nAnd the reporter from the London times covering the build up on the war wrote an article that ran on the front page of the world renowned paper and the article was called the miracle well\nSomeone who happened to read about general ... miracle well around two thousand Thirteen to ... to inquire whether you ever learned the source of the well the general responded no he never learn where it\nCame from the still counted as a miracle answer to prayer they'll let me ask you a question that's a really profound story do you have a hard time believing that can happen that's a good test isn't it\nDo we believe God can do that I mean does that make sense it doesn't make any sense at all and there is no explanation for it there's no way to make anything out of it except\nIt happened it's documented it took place\nNobody knows where it came from or how it got there that God do it and just do it or did he used to people to do it nobody found out about it I don't know but what it says to me is that God can do a whole lot for us that we don't give him credit for and don't even ask him for the Bible says we have not because what we asked\nWhat was the last time you ask for something that requires a little face on your part sometimes we just ask God for stuff that we know we can get on our own so we can give him a little credit along the way\nWhat if we stretched ourselves wonder if we said God I don't know how this is going to happen I don't know whether this is going to come from but I Know that you are strong and powerful and I believe you can do this and I'm going to believe you to do it by God's Grace we put him to the test\nYou and I may never need to find thousands of gallons of water every day for an army of eighty thousand people in the middle of the desert\nBut cruel I say it gives us a new perspective on the shield at face when we see God honoring face at that level of need we know we can trust God for our needs as well [noise] problems are not big or small in God's site\nIf our perspective that needs enlarging so we can see God as capable of responding to the faith that we have\nNo matter how small and insufficient you think your faith is men and women keep praying keep trust to keep seeking the lord remember it's the object of your faith almighty God not the size of your face that's important shift to focus from yourself\nTo him and then go and ask him for great things the Bible tells us that God is ready to help us if we will simply ask and I've heard this over and over again\nAttempts great things for God and expect things Greg from God\nIf we will do that God will do a whole lot more for us than we ever imagined you cannot imagine what God wants to do to the people in this room by way of their faith you cannot imagine that if all of us trust in God at the limit or we have in our own faith based what God would do\nSome years ago we had a drama team in our church drama kind of fell out of favor and we don't do that anymore but one of dramas are never forget\nTook place on our platform and there were some prompts on the platform the prompts were of file cabinets and the phone's camera it's kind of formed a little cubicle and it was just a little file cabinets everywhere and then the drama this was supposed to be the vestibule heaven\nAnd so this guy gets to heaven and Peter makes them in this little cubicle and they start to talk and wonder what these file cabinets\nAnd Peter says well there's a drawer in here for you\nAnd the young man said that Peter ... what's in the drawer and Peter said what's in the drawer is everything that God wanted to give you that you didn't ask for [noise]\nThe authority and why because the same thing that God did for you\nYesterday not setting the same yesterday today and for ever any never changes and if he said you have to keep you up and they keep pushing forward and if he calls yeah\nHe's going to complete the work and you're listening to me Fran your testimony is the most value in your life you can afford to forget\nYou can't afford to lose your testimony you've got to remember I Want to ask somebody today have you been through a dark place recently have you been borrowed dry place recently\nThe devil tar miniature mind recently has it felt like that you just can't get through when you pray it felt like that happens are closed I ever felt like your pray and it goes up to the ceiling and it bounces back all\nI Want you to remember this morning I won't you don't remember what God has done for you think about the times that he's brought you out I still do hold it goes this morning and this move\nTo like the oddball to remind somebody better a member of the things that he has done for you\nI Want to read the scripture over in the book is Samuel Samuel twelve and twenty four I've read this many times but I Love it and listen to me it's only fair the lord and service I mean we're all\nYour hard line for ten cent or\nHow great things he has done for you listen to me bring on the lord has been so good he spends so hateful and we owe him all the praise listen to me think about the times that you are at the bottom and God came by\nAnd he lifted you out said about the times whenever you are I'm diamond and you're miserable and dodge came through and then make them time take up out of the times when the bills weren't too\nOut of nowhere godsend somebody out of nowhere groceries appeared on the table out of nowhere just send the Nick of time he was so I think it always was do you have\nA testimony this morning I'm telling you if you will reach back it knows memory book Tempe pull out all the times that reflects on all the times it does come through for yeah it does something to the heart of a believer done I don't know where I\nRight now I don't know what to do it in me right now but I Know one thing for certain that you weren't with\nMe and times gone by tomorrow with me in times when I had no hope when I had no friends you weren't there with me while I Know that if you've done in front of me wants your word says it will never change you'll be the same yesterday\nAnd today an for ever and my God friend if he's delivered on time he'll delivery again don't get down this morning don't give up this morning look up to the hills from ones come at George help remembered that God is so safe for God\nListen even when I have not been paid for God's sake for even when I have not been served him Godspeed unfaithful that's never been a time in my
