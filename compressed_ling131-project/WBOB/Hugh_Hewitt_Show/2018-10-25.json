B. O. B.\nHere on the top stories were bringing us morning the media and the Democrats are saying the political rhetoric from President Trump needs to tone down after explosive devices were sent to Democratic Party leaders\nLast night's gubernatorial debate between Robin Sanders said Andrew Gillum got heated especially on issues dealing with education and race\nSince two thousand six team the largest group of new voters and the sunshine state our independence\nContact the edge dean show on AM six hundred and one on one one one event for calling to to to talk to to to find my email me\nAll right good Thursday more it is Thursday right just making sure the Florida Georgia\nA tailgate and which I don't drink but I'm here and it's going to be worthwhile a thing of going out\nTo destroy a lot of fun to be big tradition here in the first dose theory has so and I got tickets they normally go to all these games I got box seats that's how I got my check is obviously you're ed deem that's the thing yeah you\nKnow I'm Glad somebody recognizes that around here anyway good morning I Am a dean along with my good friend colors Roger Anderson right here on TALK radio W. B. O. B. so let's get to it bombs suspicious packages the political rhetoric had been set\nWell the political rhetoric has been going on for some time but suspicious bomb packages sent to the media of CNN and High Party Democrat leaders here is the latest before we get down to all the politics behind it Brian let us from Fox News\nJessie the FBI says the packages center former attorney general Eric Holder the Obamas the Clintons George Soros and CNN we're all similar they were all the same type of packaging that potential explosive devices were packed into heavy manila envelopes with computer generated editors\nAnd they all had six American postage stamps and all of the packages had a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nIn Florida and her name was misspelled now on Tuesday night a package than to the Clinton was intercepted before it even reach their homes are screening technician\nAt an offsite facility where they check all of the Clinton mailed meantime this morning this explosive device was mailed to CNN's headquarters in New York it was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan who is a contributor at CNN it contained wires and a black pipe\nThere was also an ... filled with white powder and now the time Warner center was evacuated the bomb was a mood by a concrete truck brought to a bomb squad facility to be examined and then safely detonated\nOkay so that's pretty much what took place but we all know where this was going Brett Baer from Fox News says let a lot of it is is I mean we have no clue what's going on but everybody thinks it's all ... around the political rhetoric going on with just days upcoming two the two thousand and Eighteen Mitt\nTerms for the person is being circumspect in his comments about the package bombs and what is a highly charged partisan environment of course president made a somber statement today at the White House calling for unity\nHouse and Senate minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer released a joint statement saying the president's comments quote ring hollow because of past statements he's made it rally and during which they insist he condones violence Trump supporters of course they left wing Democrats are stirring up confrontations around the country\nIs is some would say an October surprise I don't know the conspiracies I'm sure\nWe'll be out there left and right about who sent to what it was there anything there but again all of this is somehow to be blamed at President Trump and is he to be blamed for all the political rhetoric John Roberts from Fox News to you\nThat political discourse in tolerance of opposing political views in this country has deteriorated to the point where many people were warning\nIt was only just a matter of time before something like this happens with the crosshairs being set on some of his fiercest political critics President Trump was careful to keep politics far away from his response to the potentially deadly mailing\nNow of course there are several questions I like to ask here because there's all this conspiracy but\nA lot of these had the return address of South Florida Democrat day uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz the packages were address to a billionaire George Soros\nHillary Clinton the Obama family former CIA director John Brennan and obscene and former attorney general Eric Holder I guess Maxine Waters by the way there were some other center Republicans would you not been reported but we'll get to all that in a little bit if this was such a public discourse all of this targeted by the press and why do they stop there\nI mean the president's going after Jim Comey he's gone after\nEverybody you know he does do that um but but but again the rhetoric is a little high freedom for my personal taste and I don't think it contributes to do anything positive message and it could take some people who are mentally unstable overhear edge here the comments\nRecently made by Eric Holder when they go low we don't go high we kick them here's another one by President Trump deploy media has made it saying that these comments like this on both sides are you know promoting violence\nYou know when they go they go low we\nDidn't know what I mean [noise] I mean\nReally does that make you want to go on the parking lot and drop the people's elbow on somebody out there\nThe former New York Japanese public safety Mike bell bony says you know when you look at these packages and he says the ... and just there's just no way they would have hit their targets whether it would have been the Obamas or the Clinton or Maxine Waters\nBut what has been really kind of confusing today for a lot of people looking at the situation is if somebody is able to take these types of packages students this type of coordinated attack happened\nYet send them to places where the chances of them actually getting to the target are very remote anyone who has any understanding the most for remedial understanding of how the secret service says there's there are security you know is that the congresswoman is not going to go and open the package themselves it's not going to be anywhere near Congress is going to be in a row\nFacility that same thing with the protecting his four presidents\nSo why go to this and of course the other question is thank God why none of them detonated ... what is in fact just today message or were they in fact functional devices that just didn't happen to go up because of a flaw in the detonator these are all questions that are being asked right after\nHe also was asked to do you think this was politically motivated as well he says you know what to say this is all done politics is just a little bit too premature\nFor political purposes and what is out there and and then that the difficulty there is that many people jumping to conclusions that must be political comedy that want to say as an investigation and lead itself you shouldn't presume any type of fact that's on the evidence you\nTechnically were they not sent all to Democrats\nOnly so this must have been politically motivated here is ...\nSo this must have been politically motivated here is after the packages were mailed out listening to a little bit this montage by the media automatically\nGuilt proven innocent and guilty whatever automatically blame President Trump\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraging violence again the media the\nYou know I I'm not going to ... technically disagree with him we do call each other names socialist\nThis and that Nazi white supremacy to me it is about the issue and now I understand the census can talk about how you're going to be the most anti Israel Jewish governor advocate what does that have to do with Florida\nWhat does the FBI I mean I understand about it being investigated whatnot he got Hamilton tickets one way or the other but to me it is about the issue is the reason why I asked this question 'cause I Want to get some more clips if the same I mean is there not enough to beat Gillum on\nWhat I mean to my conservative listeners out there I think books I'm going to\nYou wouldn't want to listen today I Want to tell you why because several people have been emailing me will add one is kill them when\nThere's going to be a Republican Senate and you're in Florida Republican House heard a lot of that kind of all of them you think of the list and I'm going to tell you why he can still be very very very dangerous\nAs a governor in the same thing could it for you on the left the same argument can be made about Ron dissenters with the Democrats were in charge right\nAnd there's also been a lot of discussion about future presidential election well in order to being a swing state who was in the governor's mansion who control the legislature they actually allocate the ah the districts at least of the electoral\nMap of Seattle but listen remember the governor's ... for for the last Twenty years we've had Democrats where okay okay so that doesn't doesn't but I get we sent\nBut in a couple of moments I'm willing to pinpoint many people have been email yet\nWe ever saw the Republicans control it folks let me tell you where Dayton Gillum can be very dangerous governor of for some of those out there but let's continue more with the ... but I mean what I'm saying is is that we get back the FBI stuff okay I understand that but isn't this one of the arguments that conservatives don't like what's going on against President Trump\nYeah I mean I'm just saying those as a journalist I'm just telling you nobody's following the FBI stuff with a thousand dollar tickets I was given a Hamilton wrote that requested that he's the killings blame it on\n... I was shocked at Broadway tickets were about expensive I take your wife out to play and it's two thousand dollars that's expensive\nReporter from the sun sentinel ask Andrew Gillum about the minimum wage and this tax proposal Gillum you did and he didn't really explain\nThat we've seen this and other places are so number one let's get to the tax\nUh and and the revenue ... proposal uh we're talking about my opponent ... a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax I Am against a state income tax I've never propose a state income tax a Ninety seven percent of businesses and the state of Florida don't pay any corporate tax rate at all Ninety seven percent now\nLet me he is correct on that and what they do pay taxes the corporate ... took say pay business tax that other local taxes as well he ... he don't pay any corporate tax they act like they don't play any pay any tax Perry right they do\nAnd guess what I'm not proposing to change that either I'm Talking about three percent of the wealthiest corporations and they said three percent a they received under the ... tax realignment which was supported by the congressman\nSix point three billion dollars from the federal government tax money our money uh always simply saying is that they can keep five point three billion dollars but we deserve a millionaire that they're coming to the state a teacher the ways they can live on offer access to high quality early learning to our children\nAll right what one more time just just listen to the hulk legislation right here\nSo number one let's get to the tax uh and the and the revenue for proposal uh we're talking about my opponent has talked a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax I Am against a state income tax I never propose a state income tax now if\nYou want to talk about good for by association the teachers' unions\nAnd the two thousands even the two thousand nine when the recession had talked about if we can't get a Jack and Jack up and local sales taxes and Tallahassee 'cause you know there's not enough money going because of the ... they were still proposing floating the idea of an income tax I covered this for years and if you want to go down with the guilt by association by\nIncluding white nationalist with Trump and then to Santa's is not fair to say that the teachers unions who volcano advocated the income tax here in the state of Florida to provide for education and killings got their endorsement now I'm said if you want to go down that pike you cat having said that\nYou said that he was not want an income tax okay I'll take him at his word but in order our good friends sound news from the James Madison Institute points out in which we put it on his radio show in the first to do it mhm he's at okay let's say you can raise a billion dollars for education funding and to give teachers\nOkay let's say you can raise a billion dollars for education funding and to give teachers a salary fifty thousand dollars a year or or let's say you could funded by jacking up by almost to eight percent I'd probably would have right now and forty percent tax\nIf you want to find the Medicaid expansion if the government started coming in from the other spending priorities when it comes to environment with red tide algae Okeechobee the dams down there and also the minimum wage what they're saying this is you have to have a sales tax increase\nOf all what thirty eight percent state wide thirty eight percent sales tax I think it was a three percent was that what the gym I said oh and by then and then\nIf you want you didn't even have to get on to another alternative tax which do you want without that they can float around is\nEasy either you make me throw it on the local level or you have to have an income tax\nNo I I could be wrong but as I understand we're dealing with talking about with respect to the Medicaid expansion was seen not saying that simply what do you want it to do was to except the proposed rule under Obamacare which has now kind of being fizzled out\nAnd received the federal money that was coming into wouldn't cost the taxpayers afford anything he was making it look like we were leaving money on the table from Washington because of philosophical problems we had but with the stretching with Obamacare expansion\nGuy so let let me let me pinpoint this again with the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare the federal government for the first three years will pay a hundred percent okay after the per year so let's say started in two thousand Thirteen if\nThis was after we would have taken the money after three years Florida picks up eight percent okay of all that cost that means that it took eight percent will say seven percent seven percent Ninety percent\nIs going to be paid for by the fat Florida has to pick up seven that means it's millions into the buildings now okay what if the federal government which the notorious for not paying their bills here Roger\nThey come in and say well we can't afford the Ninety or we're going to cover ... Ninety percent that means a state of Florida has to cover\nAn extra ten percent on top of the or the quarter the budget already spending\nTwenty four twenty five twenty eight billion on when it comes to that of Medicaid ... so the feds come back and say well we can't afford any more we can only pick up eighty five percent of the cost that means for us to pick up Fifteen Percent of the cost that means folks are looking at high taxes for is going to be stuck with is\nThat the whole point I see okay that is the whole point they got into another big debate on the issue of education to\nGet on this question for you you said we've got to end the for profit education system in reference to charter schools in the state ... percent of the students in Florida [noise] ten charter schools to provide an alternative to traditional public education [noise] are you saying he would cut any dollars away from what funds charter schools in this state you\nKnow I'm not proposing any change to the current status quo but what we are saying\nIs that we're going to put money into our public system we're over Ninety percent of our kids are still being educated and\nWell Andrew staying in a different to him because of the Democratic primary that charter schools will be done so here's my thing they're public schools they're not district managed schools and so they have the ability to innovate and and be a little more nimble and these are parents who are making the decision\nAnd we're going to get more than just a little bit yes they would have to increase the sales tax to thirty nine percent Mm six percent is that right now yeah so we're going to continue to cover this more as a as we continue to move along tripled you talk nicer report tripled to eight to five five talk radio W.

you know is that the congresswoman is not going to go and open the package themselves it's not going to be anywhere near Congress is going to be in a row\nFacility that same thing with the protecting is the former presidents\nSo why go to this and of course the question is thank God why none of them detonated ... what is in fact just to a message or were they in fact functional devices that just didn't happen to go up because of a flaw\nIn and of course now the left and the Democrats along with the media somewhat say almost one of the same of course is trying to make political hay about this but ... says it may be political but that's not how you want to go along when it comes to an investigation\nFor political purposes at what is out there and and then that the difficulty there is that many people jumping to inclusion that must be political an economy that want to say as an investigation should lead itself he shouldn't presume any type of fact that's on the evidence\nBut who is making a political Bret Baer from Fox News says that well it's been the season of course of political rhetoric\nIs being circumspect in his comments about the package bombs and what is a highly charged partisan environment of course president made a somber statement today at the White House calling for unity\nHouse and Senate minority leader Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer released a joint statement saying the president's comments quote ring hollow because of past statements he's made it rallies during which they insist he condones violence Trump supporters of course they left wing Democrats are stirring up confrontations around the country\nThere's the question if you're going to play the blame game of the political rhetoric that everybody thinks is the reason why that's suspicious packages containing a devices of bombs and all that type out there who's to blame is that President Trump\nIs at the last comments by Eric Holder what you'll hear right now we they go low we kick them president\nTrump says you know when they go low we go low we\nSlamming my [noise] wow\nThat makes me want to go up and put Debbie Wasserman changed as the return address cause I'm kicked off balance slam somebody oh come on\nDon't usually get our give it to be made with the president a guide states of America has a bigger bullhorn than some of these other guys that are low ranking with very few people could even recognize if they saw their picture\nWell let me ask you a question if you eat the negative\n... coverage Ninety two percent by the media Research Center on CNN and that of MSNBC of course they're highlight as ms impeach forty five Maxine Waters out there but still the question is that if you look at what happened\nThrough Ted Cruz and Pam Bondi my girl here in the state of Florida you also look what happened with that job via let me see uh uh the Mitch McConnell a serious how can we say or do you see those are the conservative because if it did this had happened folks and this would have made the news of them go into those have Democrats\nTheir houses and where they live and the restaurant heckling them\nYeah but you know be killing people and and even if somebody is Trump's invaded no so yeah that that's a lot different than sitting somebody we could actually kill people\nThey could not weight again we have no clue who is or one or plural who is at fault for the suspicious of the package and those out there but the media couldn't wait to take swipes of President Trump he has\nAmendment three take away entirely local voter ...\nType of issue in the future similar to a gambling on a statewide ballot requiring sixty percent of the vote to approve something it would also it takes away the power of the legislature to put something on the ballot in the future going forward\nAnything in the future would have to be a citizen conditions so folks have to gather\nUm those are the two biggest things I could go into lots of reasons from a specific uh uh gambling point of view but it's going to cost jobs it's going to take away Kurt Kurt games they're amount under state law because some of those don't like them and it's going to cost a million dollars for education over several years\nSo it really is it a special interest amendment and courage and hope that people were to educate themselves and the girl one of them a free\nJamie here's an interesting question for years as a reporter and threatened in on TALK radio always been curious\nThat if you want to local control why not just have a local amendment I mean why would you want to leave voters in Miami to decide the fate of those in for example in Jacksonville in the same question I Would ask Jamy why would you want voters in Jackson will decide the fate in the panhandle of a local issue\nWhere like they give you when you start talking to people ah and when you start touching them with our message and I remember we only raised and a girl public information about Fifteen sixteen million dollars the Disney and a seminal for well over fifty million dollars so they're touching more people than we are\nWe only have to ... percent fortunately but every person we touch and every person we message what I just mentioned a moment ago\nNow like of course on voting no I mean citizens don't like to have other parts of the state tell them what they want to do in their local communities I mean people in your actual you tell them Miami and a leak out really are going to decide what happened in your part of your decision making process\nYou're really upset and I'm vice versa\nBe reminded accidental telling them what they were here in control of their own community so let's say it is a a very good points on the issue and uh\nAs people learn about it or we hope that they continue to vote no\nCare on our news make it a line Jamie ... with the group the truth about amendment three to pack\nThe amendment says this is how it's semi ranger Jamie ... gives quote voters the exclusive rights to decide whether any new casino can open up in the state and they say that it takes away the right as you point out from the Florida Legislature\nYou know Jamie ... why do we want to state constitutional measure Tallahassee is always talked about this issue they can address this issue anytime they want is is just trying to use it as an excuse if it doesn't go the way they can sit back and say well Jamie voters decided that is that the lame excuse some are saying\nThat that is absolutely a big lame excuse in the last ... years and look\nWe we we've craft or ... years ago many many years ago after our constitution that is ... they're just stabs or framework by which we govern ourselves it's a framework walk by elected officials and how we elect the\nBuildings in the constitution shouldn't be there to protect the rights of our citizens except live within the borders are state\nThings do not belong in the constitution like vaping or fracking gambling it just it makes no sense at all and and they say well gambling in the constitution\nI say yeah you know it's right your foot in the constitution back in the thirties and it's been a tinker with over the years that is true but I tell them I said do you do don't we learn from the heirs and the stakes are past not on this issue but others and we we we change we just don't keep doing the same thing over and over again\nSo it it is unfortunate that and and and you know ... and I'll say that you know on a mass ... would have been three but I Would tell everyone is well if you go down a lot of those issues and passengers on the ballot this year I tell people this if you don't know vote no\nA good one constitutional amendments are put on there by usually special interest or in this case and the joker the the ... election year is this thing that the CRC that comes around every Twenty years in our state\nWhere we supposedly have a group of of um uh people representing our state to come in and think about things that need to be in our constitution\nAll it is an opportunity for the Senate president speaker house the governor attorney general maybe a judge to put people on there that they're liquor or worked at a visual debates me deal with things that they can't deal with it don't want to deal with the legislative process it's a joke\nWhen ... Jamie and you pointed out that this goes well beyond the parties out there but I mean for years they talked about it you know whether or not you agree with John more again on his marijuana whether or not you agree with minimum wage if they get it done by the petition process and I don't have to agree on these issues Jamie by\nThe least do with the right way there's been a lot of criticism even by pulled both parties that the CRC just kind of bypassed all that the constitutional vision commission that\nAny time that you want to get all the signatures that they may want to make certain groups do the difficult way and then give it a little bit more easier for them away now let me sidetracked here Jamie sheltered by the way who is with the group the truth about amendment three he says vote no\nJamie you're going to have parents sit back and go well Jamie this has got to be a good amendment Disney the mouse it does opposes you guys Jamie they supported this amendment\nThe the mouse it goes opposes you guys Jamie they support in this amendment how do you counteract that\nWell I tell them I said look Disney do they like all over the wrong way and Dr gambling no grouping go gambling on a cruise ship records show they've had investment in\nAnd a girl my ... ... from the ... for years but that's that's not their real compelling reason for being opposed to it\nThere is basically tourism and conventions\nThey figure that if other counties in the state especially in Jacksonville which passed a referendum two years ago for casino\nBut you have slot machines in the existing facility\nThat's all that that all of a sudden people start that's another entertainment venue for uh people coming down I Seventy five I Ninety five and all of a sudden a new convention center comes along\nA label to create more jobs more entertaining things here in Jacksonville and they stop here and they don't go to Orlando for conventions and we're going to be a theme parks got ...\nFrom the mouse they're involved also another gambling initiatives huh\nYeah [laughter] don't you just love this little house\nIs owned by ABC and ESPN ESPN or obviously is interested in and and promotes a or the draft your panel's much look for the record arm in favor of does report up I think it should be legally she'd be taxed like any other form of gambling surgery and let people play it\nPeople want to play it let them play we're at and and just so you know FanDuel and drafting have or have joined our efforts they send out emails to their customers they've given us money for our campaign\nThe allies given money to clarify narcan as we're only but football clubs in the national football league the Tampa Bay buccaneers in Miami golfing the jaguars are committed to us we have a finger money yet\nBut they are interested in it from us from the sports betting okay there you know that this car is sports betting will not be allowed in the state of\nWar right set aside the ... the issue of gambling um ... there's been does it have argued in favor and we're not arguing on on that I'm just saying there have been does have said let's use it for educational it's used for fire and police\nAnd Jeannie if you wanted an argument voted up or down state wide not locally but for statewide gambling why does it just said why don't they just vote on it and the Tallahassee just say we supported or we heavily oppose it why not just do that then\nThe you know ... ... if they have they had a chance to do that I'm most recently the past two years and there have been trying to do something for a few years they'll get complicated but it's not something that can't be overcome tired and I would tell you and this is the fact the the there was there was a gambling reform package\nPassed but the Senate approved by all the ...\nOne person ... Richard Corcoran\nWould not hear the bill he is he just doesn't like gambling so one person took appeal off the table that would have given additional product to counties and single facility very ... it would have closed existing facilities around the state or in front of ... to have new product\nIt would have been a contraction of gambling it would've stopped greyhound racing it would have done after I think it would increase the tax rates are on those new facilities aren't used tax rates on some existing facility and it would've been hundreds of millions of additional dollars but the state coffers but Richard Corker stopped\nAll right we're going to get to more of this as we continue to move along Jamie Shelton with the group the truth about amendment three Jamie good to talk to you today\nAnd thanks for having me I don't have a great day sir\nYeah that's a fascinating issue fascinating\nI got a clip that off fascinating issue\nMore as we continue to move along we'll just roll those over into the next one air tribute to talk triple to eight to five five now just for the audience out there we don't we don't endorse products whatsoever\nTo me Roger this is it I mean you can some people can make it about gambling whatever the point is is should voters someone say how the right\nTo whether or not they want gambling or they want offshore drilling and jak whatever I understand that argument\nWouldn't genius saying about this argument is that voters in Miami should not dictate policy in Jacksonville that is the argument we're bringing up rights just won't let everybody know your calls are coming up next I Want to hear from you tripled to talk triple to eight to five five W.

I just lay out the facts nobody cares about my position\nBut the question is should the owners in Miami decide whether or not Duvall county wants to do this that whatever they want to do with their own local laws\nWas and is still complain that many local officials didn't like Tallahassee telling people what to do when it came to taking away local control on the air being bees on regulations when it came to real states\nI mean do we want more local control that suggested just the question I'm asking you because it's now butter skin decide in Miami to a constitutional measure I'm not saying you need a green was gambling I'm just saying what is next oh\nMaybe we should decide and how tall building maybe maybe wish the sign of how we're going to give you a football leagues and more want to be propose would've Jackson but wanted to have its own baseball team should voters down in South Florida should this be dictated on the state one constitutional measure\nBy the way I Do the research Disney cruise line does not include casinos on their\n... that's what I was asking other villages and cruise line minds royal Caribbean bank that royal I can promise you are but anyway [laughter] I'm a criminal guy right so so that is the question this is about local control\nThat is what I'm asking you at tripled to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five is this a measure because they've got enough petitions which they did it the right way\nShould this be part of the state constitution my question to you state senators and to use state wraps folks ...\nIf this was a vote with your constituents voted or not why not just bring it up for a vote that's all I'm saying voted up voted down why do we keep tinkering with this and by the way if we don't support the expansion of gambling which is fine but you can\nThen why would you keep the lottery system around that we don't we always ate so new lotto ticket out there I get what's the main question I keep asking consistency tripled to Tom triple\nTo eight to five five are gonna get to add ... promoting the books dot com here in a few moments with a rip off of the week let's go to Paul Paul good morning on WB obey\nLike it's going to get more than they are of others gambling ... some states that are currently have this about the gambling that's legal or if you say you that that communities do it or you basically let the some of the poor communities this that and they're going to decide to gamble\nAnd he built Oregon or something like that and look at what it's done does can\nPeople sit in front of a machine all day twenty four seven just flipping through it and they're losing money\nUm and then you have to have gamblers anonymous and all this other stuff so that's my take on it are you guys don't do it\nBy the Paul says he wants more the government involved I don't gamble I don't sit in front of a slot machine you know why because I Choose not to do it don't need a government regulation to tell me not to do it I Choose not to do it and no I'm not a libertarian or liberal Terry and what do you think about this John good morning you're on WB obey\nThe quite an answer your question as these members don't want to vote on his gambling issues because they don't want to Clinton money and campaign contributions from all over him you know and he has them by out so if you give it to the people you can go back to your your your the ones you're collecting money for him and say I didn't I didn't do it they did it\nJohn I think you're correct I think you're correct I appreciate the call but I can still take money you're well the voters decided that will be wants to point of having a local elected official I mean is there are some things that voters should decide I don't have a problem with that but on an issue like this\nIsn't that why is that an argument why like my state rep my state senator to vote in favor or against us my right or wrong in that Roger I\nUnderstand how important money is to elections and fortunately I don't like it but money is the you\nKnow should I not that it should I should I leave this okay should I leave it to the local voters to Jack up my taxes here in Florida whether that sits back for example let's say I need a statewide property tax okay some states have encouraged us\nWhat if I don't want to pay property tax I pay local property tax through my Middle East right why Charlotte better suicide my back pocket up here in Jacksonville well\nIf it's state wide I can see an argument for it if it's just for Jacksonville\nI Would have a problem we will be out but here's the point I don't want a property tax state wide right we raise property taxes locally through a county commission school board and or there was a water district sometimes end or a city council why do I want to let voters society statewide property tax bill will but if you want to do you raise it locally\nAnd the money that goes to Tallahassee for their education is not David up properly it goes down to South Florida and vice versa here and do all catty leave it for the local control to all the Republicans keep talking about local control where is the consistency Jay or good morning on WB obey\nYesterday and I'm going to solve your problem or your brother sorry her first a\nScam I think uh think about it to a seminal tribe down south to have their own exclusive gambling okay a younger one number two you know we got the lottery that joke well even if they get voted in still going to have local governments deciding where\nOh it is still going to have local governments deciding where it is when it is\nHow it is because they do it right now for a certain stores you know what I'm Talking about those are forced to work that you were liquor stores you know it can't be around for a school that\nUm maybe offshore it okay yeah you can have it but you got to go on a ship and you're going to go offshore anywhere you looked at it every court ruled on gambling open Pandora's box\nYeah I I Would agree I mean you can only have it all you can already happened offshore if it becomes a state constitution new for the most part the city's don't get a say in Tallahassee can dictated\nNow they want to allow the cities to do what they can write sort of for example the marijuana debate\nAnd marijuana and medical marijuana is a monopoly in this day not everybody can do it not only said he can get involved why do you think that many cities sit back and say we don't wanna get involved Roger 'cause there's no money for them to be made and say well gee are coming from but it does get into a state constitution he dictated in all the way to take care of it you got to go back to the constitution\nI'm just saying well what's the point about

Enrique's since twenty six team the largest group of new voters in the sunshine state our independence\nAnd the media and Democrats are saying the political rhetoric from President Trump needs to tone

be\nMore as we continue to move along on your hosted dean along with Roger hinder sitting right here on TALK radio WBFO be\nLet's get to it job blew away no blue wave blitz ah to talk to the conversation on our news making line is the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida blazing goal yeah so let me play for you a clip this was mayor does Kelly spokesperson for or with the Democratic National Committee downplaying the blue wave here in Florida\nMy position I never said there were massive ... waves and these are very difficult district and there's a lot of outside money that can play and very significant role in these races we believe it will be close within a few feet and whether we win or lose the majority\nOr they backtracking\nCan yeah of course they're backtrack and uh they're backtrack and the same way Andrew Gillum is backtracking on the Hamilton tickets the same way he backtracked getting on Medicare for all the same way he backtracking on a\nState income tax with the fact of the matter is is that we've been saying all along I think in ... and I have actually been on your show saying that\nThey keep on talking about this a blue wave especially here in Florida and well we've been seeing and especially in the data that there is no such thing as a blue wave here for it I Would call it more sort of like a a blue ripple I'm so there are more Democrats coming out and voting\nBut there are a lot more Republicans coming out and vote and that it's clear and the data so far that trend has started a couple of weeks ago with the absentee ballot return starting to come in and it still continuing all through early voting so far this week\nOkay but the to be honest you know the number of ... of request had been in favor of Democrats now the number of returns you are correct has been for the Republicans but those out there to say that the early voting going on right now the Democrats plan to make up the difference is that too early to tell\nNo it's actually not too early to tell on all explained why\nSo the first thing is that when you break down a lot of the absentee ballot requests um a lot of the Democrat request are people that have traditionally just never voted for these people requested ballots for two or three election cycles\nThat never cast their ballot in two or three election cycles so they're adding people that they know are just going to vote now in addition what they do what they have done is they've taken it they've done an extraordinary job\nI had that will I'm going to compliment the Democrats they have done an extraordinary job of taking all of their uh election day voters and getting him to vote\nBy absentee ballot now that's not good\nFor them because that means all they're doing is they're shifting their voters to get them to request absentee ballots and they're not returning ballots I'm On a a a\nOn it but what I loved her rate but what but what I'm getting at is it let's say the Republicans do have a majority with the with the absentee ballots but now you've got early voting which is which I always do by the way but oh but now always trained to be supportive of Democrats some of those in the media but that's\nBut see that's the problem the problem is is that a lot of that democratic voters would have already voted by absentee they're not going to be around to vote early and by election day that's the problem for the Democrats that's that's the problem that the Democrats have right now\nThe only member hurt Hillary Clinton was opposed to a bank the state of Florida and run early the absentee ballot she didn't do it\nWill be the same dynamic the same thing that happened last election cycle it's happening this election cycle\nSo it ways of those Democrats that normally would talk and mail it back on TALK and go to the early voting 'bout boost this week that you don't think they can make up a difference\nWhat the way the data that I'm looking at it right now All right I'm saying is that it's going to be very difficult for them to make up the difference it's it's one of the reasons why it was able to go on TV\nVery early elections last election cycle on and predict that Trump was going to win the state of Florida because that trend was holding the ... the same trend is holding right now\nOkay what about that that's fair to say what about the displaced voters after hurricane\nTake what about that that's fair to say what about the displays voters after hurricane Michael what do we know about that\nWell what we do know is that\nUm the governor has issued the executive or we have now eight counties a bay county obviously being hardest hit\nAnd now we have the uh the super bowl ring sites that have that have opened up and now it's our job is parties just to inform the voters along with the secretary of state that voting is is going on with where we're going to lose votes in the panhandle\nThat is going to be a ... is our first concern has to make sure that they're all safe and they're in the process of rebuilding their communities but we want to give them access to the polls if they're choosing to vote\nSo we expect most of the super voters to vote\nAnd we expect um less mark and voters to vote in this election last election it's just\nIt's just going to be how it is I mean obviously we've gone through a a a a very serious issue up there with that with that hurricane um we're projecting to lose\nI don't know maybe anywhere between ten to Fifteen maybe twenty thousand votes statewide but we're going to make that up and places like you know we county Collier county Republican strongholds because Republicans are just voting in droves right now\nOur job blazing goal East Germany the Republican Party of Florida Wednesday night's debate this\nIs what Andrew Gillum said when he was asked about his tax proposal here's a clip numbering and\nWe've seen this in other places are so number one let's get to the tax\nUh and and the revenue for proposal uh we're talking about my opponent has suffered a lot about the fact that I Want to propose an income tax I Am against a state income tax I've never propose a state income tax\nA Ninety seven percent of businesses in the state of Florida don't pay any corporate tax rate at all Ninety seven percent and guess what I'm not proposing to change that either I'm Talking about the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in the state\nThree no listen you didn't need the James I mean I'm a big fan of the gene Madison and James Madison Institute but I mean nobody I mean I\nJust perplexed but you might have just Santa's campaign that doesn't column how he's going to pay for the Medicaid expansion here in Florida would you voted against by the way which I applaud you also he does that explain the education side okay whatever he doesn't explain how he blames the subsidized companies that do the employee the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage I think ... exactly correct\nThey're going to make up their money one way or the other remember Amazon just didn't do a blanket Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage they found ways of paying for it right instead of passing it on to the consumer of that book they took it out of their employees back pocket back to his point is going to employees as well\nYou know they got a Fifteen dollar minimum wage to start but they lost their stock options which could have made many of the millionaires over the longer term\n[noise] All right let's go to a more called who's good Ron Hey Ron good morning you're on WB it'll be\nFun at I'm Sorry I heard the Florida Republican chairman a Republican Guard sentiments comments and\nIn light of everything that's going on it was very unfortunate here and there are no longer alive and while he was fear among during an lying about was not to his credit mobs are immigrants\nBut at a certain point Republicans need to learn a lesson that even the what's going on today completely unrelated to comes writer at the national party right or wrong or take a a chill pill and let and let 'em run a lot but here's what he longer than line about that is what the fed up with a lot about\nAnd it and the fact that they live out something so demonstrably false indicates that had a very low opinion of the ... of the voters\n... hold on what what did he live I'm I'm not following you because I didn't talk to the chairman about what happened with the package as we talked about the blue wave\nYeah and I'm not yeah and I'm saying here's what he lied about alright and Florida as you probably do it in a gang unconstitutional\nUnder the constitution to levy a personal income tax to change that you would have to change the Florida Constitution cry Andrew Gillum even if he wanted to cannot impose a personal income tax on any person in the state of Florida\nIs demonstrably false for Santa has he has said for the national for the state party chairman as he said this morning\nTo fear my younger and lie about the fact that there's going to be a personal income tax because there will not be a personal income tax\nNot going to happen you have to change for a constitution probably need a ballot initiative\nHow many are you going to get the requisite percentage to impose their personal income tax and the state of Florida\nProbably not so it was unfortunate to hear the national to hear the state party chairman do that and the only purpose it serves as to live so discord and fear among are like oh interviewing coming for your back pocket Andrew Gillum can't come for your back pocket and that way even if you wanted to\nKnow what's going to disagree with you you you have to go through the state constitution which is amended all the time it does and just as says he wants to impose an income\nYou know which is amended all the time it does and justice says he wants to impose an income I don't disagree with the bird that he wants to impose I mean heck I Want to impose a lot of stuff as well but the reality world is maybe I might I may not be able to get it done I don't think there's any fear mongering by that you are correct he can't do it on his out\nBut if he wants to impose their habit he he's got a way of imposing it I mean it may be slicing words there\nTake her to advocate for it but you're going to have to tell you the state constitution and what the state party chairman what to say that we didn't want to believe that he could just lobby the legislature and get a simple bill passed and that's not the way it's going to work that is absolutely\nYou know he could lobby the legislature can technically put down on the state to state ballot for it to be voted on that is true\nThat's true and he could advocate for it right again like I said it requires changing our constitution I material facts that keeps getting left out every time to than than however many times the state chairman said I don't follow them that closely\nThat the material fact they leave out because it would take away from the weight of their argument of Gilmore Gillum if you kill 'em you're going to get a state income tax because she can't pay for everything that he wants\nTo do so by the way to change the constitution I understood I\nListen I I'm not I I called the way I totally I mean ... says he does not want to state income tax let me say take a breath his word\nIn order for him to have funding for other priorities the only way you do it is that you try to tax more businesses to er corporate income tax you raised estate sales tax or you know the taxes on local cities or if you want and by the way the unions have advocated is it for years he used to have a state income tax\nSo there's got to be one of those for you and a half the door all four to raise more money here that Gillum was not talking about\nWell he's talking about raising the corporate tax\n... but that doesn't surprise the minimum wage or pay for Medicare or Medicaid expansion\nOf Medicaid expansion is paid for by federal subsidy\nNot after three years it isn't you got to pay for the majority of it but you've Florida still have to pick up the tab almost up to ten percent\nUh well I mean also the idea there is that increase participation in that market reduces costs over the long term but\nDo you mean oh you mean the participation where you're taxing more people to pay for other people\nBy the way the participation in the market isn't there because people are not signing up on Obamacare they are it's because there's only one insurance their books I tell the way it is a Gillum does you have to listen to want to impose Rogers is a difference a verb itch\nKnow Gillum they the heat if you want more you got to have to impose their but they're not going to get a ... income tax is never going to happen here is this answers wrong to dissenters ... I think to say this could clarify a lot on Gillum which he's not weird you more than that now this radio show but you're gonna have to raise a lot more money here\nNow you can talk about I mean those associate with Gilmore advocated an income tax the teachers' unions have done it for years just saying just hasn't talked about that\nHe's right the caller is exactly correct you just can't have it I agree with that but if you have more spending and other areas where the state is going to pay for your local property taxes which is nothing more than a glorified income tax you're gonna have to pay for it and the Republicans have done it through education as well let's go to Joe Joe good morning you're on WB obey\nThem ... hey listen on all the um [noise] ... ah I think everybody should call them down before they're blaming each other who did this and who did that yeah ... because\nOf the fact if you remember a few years back when my ... and ... she was running for office his office on us had the same idea was to analyze that dictator that he wasn't racist or something on a sign there and\nEverybody was blaming the opposite party and all that and they found out it was wasn't have somebody from his own\nCampaign did that to make him look you know that he was that he was being picked on by the other party\nYeah those are the emails I'm getting false flags the conspiracies out there that the Democrats did this\nI don't know all I Know is there was a lot of hypocrisy going on when you want to talk about political rhetoric that is me and violet more\nOf your calls are coming up next love to hear from you at tripled who talked tripled to eight to five five talk radio W.

students in Florida attention the schools to provide an alternative to traditional public education [noise] are you saying he would cut any dollars away from what funds charter schools in this state you\nKnow I'm not proposing any change to the current status quo but what we are saying is that we're going to put money into our public system where over Ninety percent of our kids are still being educated and\nWell Andrew singing a different to him because of the Democratic primary he said charter schools will be done and here's my thing they're public schools they're not district managed schools and so they have the ability to innovate and and be a little more nimble and these are parents who are making the decision to send their kids to the schools in some of them are succeeding I mean let\nMe let me say first off the congressman has accepted tens of thousands of dollars from Betsy develops actually two hundred thousand dollars\nA their agenda is simple it is completely to defund the public education system to stand up the for profit charter school industry for profit my opposition was to for profit schools are in this day uh this is what we ought to do we ought to unleash the talented teachers to teach\nAnd ... ... in my opinion the unmitigated kind of our students to learn why should we for say Ninety percent of the kids are going to focus only on ten percent or\nDie only focus on the ten percent that actually did much better when you look at some of the other Ninety percent by the way you do know that I'm now\nForty seven plus percent of kids that go to school go to a school choice virtual school private school\nA magnet program yeah magnet um listen\nCouldn't understand just be more specific on issues of Gillum spending taxi I agree I don't think

lied okay this is about issues\nAnd the bottom line is he's not specific I was going to pay for the Medicare and Medicaid expansion he's not specific I was going to pay for the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage and subsidizing business that we know he's super far left he doesn't explain for the education aspect the charter schools out there and by the way for profit schools I don't care\nIf the ACLU and I'm no fan of them want to run a private school charter school is in the end result Roger isn't at all about the end result\nYou know making sure the kids get educated and giving the families an option as where you want your child and by the way the government saying your child's going to go here because\n... and do we advocate for profit I mean our school districts do we want them in the
