I don't want to but you don't want to get re no that's not it I just don't think they said it was clear as the ones we're used to use the radio I\nListen to everything that comes through our and I mean ... I ever had a clear except I've got my own peer ... hey we are setting ready to go good morning everybody it is three minutes after the\nTop of the hour I Am a dean here in the mornings along with Roger Anderson no matter if you're in traffic Roger no matter if they're coming home from work this morning going to work I promise you you don't have to agree with Rogers to use 'cause nobody cares about mind\nYou will be undertake as we do it tripled to talk nine zero for triple to eight to five five\nSo let's get to it the latest numbers show that Republicans here in the state of Florida are outpacing Democrats an early absentee now Roger before we go any further just for the audience because don't properly explain this I Will get a boatload of emails a lot of people are asking about the amendments we're going to cover that this week and everything else\nThe Democrats yes percentage wise or it comes to the turnout and voter enthusiasm have and an advantage over the Republican that's the percentage wise when it came out a couple of weeks back as we reported that Florida daily dot com also in his radio show\nThat normally the Republicans out pays the Democrats as far as requesting absentee ballot Ralph requesting\nThat was passed up that was all Democrats surged by about twenty five thousand of those requesting so they showed a heavily turnout much more than Republicans\nAs far as what has been returned now in mail that it's almost about seven hundred thousand ballads currently Republicans about scoring the Democrats forty four percent\nDemocrats at thirty eight ... now that number's been cut it was like nine about six points for Democrats\nHad are trying to cut the lead in there as well so that's pretty much what's going to end up taking place boaters impacted by hurricane Michael another big news story out there the Florida department of state which oversees the Florida election say that their top priority is to make sure\nThat again I think there was they maybe four hundred thousand voters that have been displaced with no power\nThe counties are expediting there are going to keep early voting\nOpen a lot longer out there and ... and many of these areas west ah of ah of course was Tallahassee on a ... of the county's got affected by the storm voting by facts or email we'll not be allowed\nI write voting by facts remain I Will not be allowed the United States Postal service says a lot of these are areas that were out there already resuming areas polling stations that were damaged so they're gonna try to do everything they can to get things going be overall estimates ah when it comes to hurricane Michael Fox Business new says it costs to anywhere up to thirty\nBillion dollars claims journal dot com says the costs can be around twenty five I look at several billions of residential losses with commercial losses as\nWell how many also the debate\nSunday evening between Democrat Andrew Gillum Enron descent as we've got around to Santos and some would say I love it let's get to the clips couple areas where the issue about the environment and water rising levels out there Andrew Gillum says you know what we need we need someone as a governor to look out when it comes to the issue of science\nFor so what Florida voters need to know is that when they elected governor they don't have a governor who believes in science which we have had for quite some time and\nMaybe they need a governor might leave an economics I'm Sorry go ahead\nSay I'm not sure what is so California about believing that the state of Florida out a lead in solar energy I wouldn't know what the sunshine state\nAt the very least what we can do is be a global leader here we've got to see on the forty nine states of what to do and what it means that the state that quite frankly leans into the challenges of the green economy and bills one and at the same time bills and economy that last\nCan I ask you a question what does he mean by the challenges of the green economy we tried there's ten years ago with Charlie Crist we try to do with the Obama presidency or don't you lived market forces dictated they want to go down that road inside the government trying to push it\nYou know what there's a lot of government intervention with a lot of different things and I guess this is something he obviously thinks government still needs to continue to be involved with to see happen you know this being the quote sunshine state let's\nKick it off a lot of issues with the gubernatorial debate which is another one will take place I think Wednesday evening down in South Florida but the issue of race came up like we were shocked\nSummer again to the Congress men they let us know exactly where he was going to take this race that day after he won the nomination the monkey a comment that at all and he is only continued and the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can\nOr to the color of my hand and the truth is is you know what I'm black I've been to like all my life so far as I Know that line\nBut this is the point that the only color that the people at the state of Florida care about is the blue green algae flowing out of the ... you\nKnow that Elizabeth Warren cannot say that street just say I was born Cherokee I Will die Cherokee spent all my life and I was a high chair of the\nColor that the people of the state of Florida care about is the blue green algae flowing out of the east and the west side of the state and they deserve a governor who is going to protect the environment after Twenty years that we're not going to protect a day off to the area and\nI Wish I could do the fact checked I wished CNN would contract with me you and I both go I've gone to see Annette I'm just I'm like well I Wish they would contract that first of all the color a state of Florida cares about\nIs green green I thought he was going to save it and he talked about algae upset by the way he's\nGoing to need all the great for all that for all the spending he wants to do first off you know we had the science or was it a Peter Braley who's been a scientist\nWho graduated from Florida tack he's an environmental scientist who covered both sides last week and he pointed out that the red tide mixed up with some of the pollution does have a major effect but he says a lot of that combined the red tide ... we we can't prove for years whether or not this is manmade right\nRight it is if anything make say the ... the people fertilizing their lawn may have a big effect on that as well and it's All right you know it's hard to say\nOf the people fertilizing their lawn may have a big effect on that as well and it's All right\nYou know it's hard to do so by the way so he talked about the issue of race again\nLet us go back the day after the election of the primaries is is what Ron just Santa ...\nElections are always competitive and um you know this is a guy who although he's much to to wherever all for Florida I think he's got a huge problems with how he's governed Tallahassee a you know here's an articulate spokesmen for those far less views and he's a charismatic candidate and you know I watch those democratic debate none of that it was my cup of tea\nBut I mean he performed better than the other people there so so we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction let's build off the successfully pat and Governor Scott the last thing we need to do is to monkey this out by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state\nIf Trump\nThis country whoever is such a bunch of racist but are these people want to come in this country and I do a good point because I just want to ask the question\nComes out of economic socioeconomic desperation which people from countries that you know the movie economies are horrible and they're living in poverty we see no future they want to be a part of the American dream sometimes if your neighbor moves out and the the used abandoned home of the other side of you to keep your value up you've got to go and look I wouldn't\nJust agree with that do you know there's some people in American Dream of those that live in America is going to the government do ... see American Dream the media being accused I mean Republicans everybody says that Trump is\nAngering up his base to get his base to come out there in support but here's the discussion between media buzz Howard Kurtz and senior editor for the federalist Mollie Hemingway says you know what a Trump may be doing it but so is the media\nOnly been a major media fame president and whipping up as a base over cap in order to get Republican voters to turn out all these liberal columnist are openly and these are not dog whistles opening doing the same thing on the left\nAnd we may wish that people want to vote by anger anger is a very very common way for people to decide who to vote\nFor that to exactly correct ... this is what Kurtz had said about the media and the op ed telling people just get out there and vote especially for those have you on the left as media buzz\nAbout president from using the brutal Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to making conservative supporters angry but their op ed pages are preaching a rather different measures take a look\nCharles Blow in New York Times liberals this is war David Lee in our New York times get angry and get involved his lean if you're not anywhere yet you shouldn't be he's your ideal Washington Post when to stay angry on Kavanaugh\nSo aren't there are two sides to the use of anger and fear in the mid term now\nHe's talking about two sides are you've got the Trump but also what\nDo you know rally not the Democrats they claim it's it's the media\nWasn't let's be on a lot of Republicans were angry after the vote with Obamacare two thousand to innovate march or April that year they came out and member Obama and other Democrats sat back and said they're cutting away your health care pre existing conditions that is to anger at the base there's anger meant on both sides you act like it comes from one side is just absolutely hypocritical\nExactly and I think it was coming from the media at least they're being taught us to stop you know op ed pieces that opinion piece and there are giving their opinions to people who write these articles so you know whether or not work with little or speaking to anybody who would vote any way ah otherwise is is up for discussion\nLosing the Julian Turner a Fox News correspondent who worked in both at the age W excuse me the WWE and the Obama White house she says when you listen to the media she says it's like they're trying to advance their own strategy to get people out and vote\nCome back to them of course we let me ask you first joined the politics of anger and fear and campaigns have basically been around forever in the history of the country but shouldn't depress report and or call out both sides equally if it's happening on the left as well as the right yeah of\nCourse they shut and that's part of the responsibility I'd actually go one step further that not only on less than I Would say that\nRiling up people is\nActually the only way to get Americans to vote particularly in terms and sells for ... stay home yeah what we I mean that the turnout is horrendous fright so this is the moment\nYou know get people angry [laughter] this is I think this is the mainstream media and most of which is left leaning doing their part to get out the vote in the ... it's almost like they've got their own electoral strategy going\nOut and and I think this is nothing new Roger and the anger my ... I mean whether it's on an issue and by the way it just doesn't happen from a national stayed happens here in Florida people sit back and say hey I don't want my taxes being raised here I don't know I mean I mean you could call it anger but it happens right\nRights Jenna got people with respect to you know trying to get them mad to get out and vote if it really is a form of manipulation and unfortunately I think it happens on both\nSides when it came to the issue of guns in the debate between Andrew Gillum and the Democrats the mayor of Tallahassee and former Congressman Ryan to St just the Republican nominee a little bit of the debate that took place Sunday night had to do with the issue of guns Galen says hey dissenters painting\nBought for by the n._r._a. while I took them on the congressman was against the piece of legislation because he his old wholly owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national\nHe owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national Rifle Association that's why they're running all these ads against me because they want the man that they bought\nA in my case we're prepared to stand up to the in our actual demanded they bought was that I'm putting them but that's okay and they sued me they drew me to court for two years all because we said we would not allow guns to be shot in a city park here we go again radical\nThat you cannot shoot guns in a park for our kids play in our family picnic that's why people are so incensed by their step because common sense and decency seem not to be able to prevail in this\nCompany ... again folks what he's not telling you is there was an already law in the book you got places like Whitcomb park in Melbourne, Florida you got state parks throughout the area that are miles long and there's a park or on the other side kids can swim and in other areas they're very confined area what you can and cannot shoot\nThat's what he's not telling you number one number two the law and some people were stating that you should be able to help poor concealed weapons permit holders\nIn case something goes south but we do that title above it and was July or August when they wanted to have a there was a rally I guess or at a gathering for people to sign up\nTo go to school and back to school sales holidays we're an individual with a concealed weapons permit was able to stop somebody else you wanted to do harm to other individuals their throughout this is what the mayor is not telling you it's not like Roger is going to hang out with a picnic with his daughters federal local park and I'm from five feet away I see a a goose ... want to shoot it\nActually is an interesting thing though those who are not aware of that detail a will assume that the governor was ... at least the ... the candidate for governor of the Democrats I was actually you know doing something that seems reasonable enlist you hear the explanation\nHairs dissenters versus Gail among the highest rate of murders in Florida and is being\nDone uh and that's Donald Trump or neglecting all sensory than in fact\nUh I ... a city that has experience in a five year low in our crime rate on trajectory to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate no matter a brief statement that what do you have to say you're going to change the fact that the CNN or Fox you have to bring fact that the commerce area for now our case so\nThe same just keeps going record number of murders last year yesterday Gillum won't answer it\nWe are the largest city in our twenties type of thing crime ... this is what I thought about it on our different than what Florida voters understand is\nThat communities will experience crime a shift in Jacksonville earlier today facts to fix people's shot I bet you of Maryland according was less than as he's like well I had to bring me and that's the question is what are we going to do about it and what I'm going to do is take on the n._r._a. and hold them responsible for the rent and crime and I I Want to add\nBy the way it does have the record number of murders\nIn the state of Florida that is documented that document will cover this more as we continue to move along\nTripled you talk tripled to eight to five five did you watch the debate last night when it was your take about what do you think I'm kinda I'm kinda curious to hear from you it was there a winner from the debate last night one issue was the winner for either Gillum indoor\nFor dissent is tripled to talk\nNine zero for triple to eight to ... talk radio W.

network ed Lynch who is blogging all last night that the Gillum probably won the debate but he says he did it because he lived through his teeth well [laughter]\nIt's going to be good always coming up I always love to hear from you at nine zero for triple to talk what'd you think about the debate last night Gillum dissenters who won and what issues where they're strong or weak for coming up next talk radio WB obey\n[noise]\nThis is what Gillum said now folks that maybe a little bit ... done it this was what Gillum said about defending his tax proposals listening closely\nWhat we're proposing so let's be clear one there is not a state income tax here in the state of Florida I'm not proposing one in the state of Florida Ninety seven percent of businesses don't pay any taxes at all\nOkay now first off that semi trip but let's go along with the argument about needing money to support all of his wants and needs here we go\nIn a state of Florida Ninety seven percent of businesses don't pay any taxes at all I'm not proposing to change that our proposal is is that for the three percent of the wealthiest corporations in this day three percent\nOf the try the Trump tax scam supported by my colleague here I walked away with six point three billion dollars of our money working people's money\nAlways saying that corporations can keep five point three billion but we're going to take a billion of that and invest in public education\nOkay so here's what he's not talking about Roger okay so you saw all these companies make billions off of Floridians\nWill yeah and that's part of business I mean\nSomebody ever asked the question how much is government and maybe how much is government make all the taxpayers when it comes to their business\nReally refer to you know the profits you were making a tax taken away it's our money [laughter] straight headsets or method me up tonight [laughter] but anyways\nThe so this is what he said but Roger this is what I keep asking\nThe question he wants to raise a billion dollars\nTo tax the so let's say he could raise it okay fine let's say you can do with the money by raising forty percent tax on three percent of all the businesses out there now folks\nNow the last going to sit back and say it was three percent can I ask you a question you live in the city of Melbourne, Florida you live in a small city bureau beach let's say you live in Jacksonville I'm a saint Augustine\nRoger ... percent of your businesses are going to be hit with higher taxes here's the question what a three percent of the businesses getting hit employ a lot of the companies out there and they sit back and say we can take it hit you they local mayors Democrats or Republicans would go along with that no they don't have we may have\nTo move out of the area for lower taxes yeah so that that's the other question that it happens right but here's the other question I Would ask real quick and I want to listen from the audience\nIs that he wants to raise a billion alone when he didn't talk about what would you wanna get into is the Medicaid expansion he hasn't talked about how he's going to find that all the environmental issues as well he hasn't talked about how he's going to pay for the minimum wage\nAnd the sand is they didn't question him about that I mean he was doing all this dirty or certainly isn't me yeah [laughter] but I mean I I Know to the other debates kind of come up Wednesday and I hope\nThey talking about the economic issues we are going to get more this year and just a little bit but I mean you know the bottom line is that if it's Ninety seven percent of the companies out there don't pay taxes and the folks that are on they do pay taxes taxes or in other areas they paid they do have to pay a business\nTax locally in state why they have to pay their taxes as well so he's not giving you the full details of what's going on and yet we continue to cover this more as we continue move along alright tripled to talk [noise] tripled to eight to\nFive five let's go to um go to Jim Jim good morning you're on WB obey\nThe morning at how you doing today what's happened in the morning or\nOr what about the the national debt and all the Democrats are lower than the Laffer curve\nOf tax revenue or we are getting more tax revenue and now that we did during the Obama years correct that showed that it has nothing to do with letting people up there that says keep the river\nRight now I'm sure there's still some policies because the Obama\nAdministration that are still there but that doesn't change the fact that a majority or the Baker could up for this is you know it's Congress it's true or anything\nOr perhaps pushing build back trucks out saying if you don't get me a budget that cutting spending that I'm not going to scientists\nFor not doing that needs to do that occasionally be that the head of us and it does not you know or or we're going to keep getting higher taxes are going to keep recording and or or see are are perfectly good\nGym you know one thing that I I I like what you had to say you didn't say here and go Trump's ... not use that back and said hey listen I mean he needs to do a better job of Europe a fair criticism of the president very fair criticism when it comes to the issue of the Republican here's a quick question\nI have many of those that listen to this radio show that again everything under the sun we blame Obama and you know we're not big Obama fan having said that\nIs that well no no Jim we had to increase the military by two hundred billion up at one point three trillion dollar so that means\nWhat happened to the other children when you hear people say Jim we we we had to take care of the people at the people who may port intend to all and ... and those that are in other ah MacDill how do you how do you defend that Jim do they have a point by saying we had to increase the debt and deficit for military families\nI don't know that the top that that's the that's the right side of the aisle say where we are we going up but it's it's not it's incredibly programs two thirds of a budget if you're caught up in ...\nWhere there are a a a liability

B. O. B. dot com ed at W. B. O. B. dot com so I can get you on the list [noise]\nMore as we continue to move along at dean here having to be all been following the caravan Roger or Mexico did turn away some of those that are said that they are going to keep coming by the caravan of five thousand Democrats still continues towards the destination of the u._s. it's kind of like watching one of these hurricanes come across the Atlantic\nYeah you you may be coming over here it's about violence you're talking about thousands of people walking toward the U.S border some of them with children and the president has already talked about sending troops down there to face them when they arrive at the border which could have happened when it happens I uh just so if I was no violence\nBut then again I keep asking the how it was a lot of violence on the border Roger we get in the question if Trump is such a racist if this country is filled with racism towards people of south of the border then why do they continue to come I'm just kind of curious the American dream\nYou know they say they want to you know participate in the American dream here's the thing you've got Japan after World War two beer economy was decimated does that we will look back on and we helped build it back up now they are one of the world's leading economies\nMexico right on the U.S border can't get their act together something wrong there I think we probably would step in and help them in there will be to our benefit\nSome of the latest numbers of Democrats versus Republicans likely voters registered voters remember the Republicans always done much better when you look at the track record over the last several election cycles here in the state of Florida tied to kind of turned around as the Democrats requested more absentee ballots then Republicans that was the first over several years\nBut according to the division of elections actually the secretary of state\nOver the last several days about seven hundred thousand maybe a little bit more Roger ... ballots have been cast it there I'm currently Republicans are out scoring the Democrats Republicans have about a forty four percent return Democrats only thirty eight\nBut folks if you've requested that's still a good sign for the Democrats they just haven't turned them all back yet that's assuming they're all the Democrat that number has kind of been cutting down to about six points it was up around seven eight points days earlier\nRight yet that typically I don't vote absentee I vote earlier this year I decided to go ahead and in the request my absentee ballot justice you know maybe get his way early I haven't even open to jail you know\nI Will tell you the reason why a lot of them have not come back yet be constitutional amendments in very confusing this week we're going to have some pros and cons on both sides on this issue how maybe I'll watch the debates Sunday night on CNN either Jake Tapper does a pretty decent job who do you think what do you watch a little bit of it\nI did in fact ... percent who did they did a better job I think you know what people do not and all the time look at the issues they look at style they look at you know how confident the guy looks whether or not his time which is you know better I think it probably would have been ... Gillum had better fool Windsor of even though he might have been making it up on his ... exactly I think he came across you know more in command\nAnd uh as issues aside and then the ... who would think a lot of people would think that as well below ... so he wants\nOne of the big issues of course was Medicaid expansion here's how Andrew Gillum explained his ... Senate\nBetter health to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one and the Florida Senate under Republican control of an effort that my opponent oppose is a ...\nBy the way he does have a point the Republican Senate voted in favor of Obamacare expansion through Medicaid expansion here on the state of Florida films exactly correct\nWe expand Medicaid here in the state of Florida we will a fin access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridians eight hundred thousand and by doing say will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government\nUm man we could spend an hour breaking this down where he's someone said Roger he's not telling the whole truth\nThat right now is being given away to other things because we philosophically disagree with\nBullets remind everybody this is part of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion the first three years the government according to the to what was happening under Obamacare which is still around the feds pay Ninety two percent of the cost\nOkay excuse me for three years it's free okay supposedly after that the pets pay Ninety two percent of the costs but folks when does the feds really pay for certain things like the border ask\nCalifornia would have done the state run Medicaid because of illegal aliens the folks Amos and Andrew Gillum brings a great point Ron disdain just brings up a valid point they'll set which a promise to take care through federal intervention of all the water problems in South Florida so my question is on the Medicaid expansion you do know that twenty eight thirty billion someone can just find the cost\nWe've had you had that water Jimmy former CFO Jim ie patrolling the CFO says that a good quarter the budgets on health care and the state of Florida so after three years floors can pick up another eight to ten percent of how much money all the feds\nCome in and say a couple of years later Roger doesn't matter who's president and we catch now it's going to be we can only four eighty five percent now that eight to nine ten percent now because of the Fifteen Percent which means you can look at your taxes being raised when it comes to Medicaid expansion Florida here's more what Gillum explained\nTo getting phone access to health care or their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or nurses association\nFor all of course the hospital's water because the pets are going to pay for it\nWe can build photos economies simply by extending access to health care and guess what it\nWhile so what we can build Florida's economy through more government programs that's basically what he said\nIt's not only good for those uh eight hundred thousand people who will get access it's also good for folks like me and for small businesses are right now I Can't afford to get access to health care because quite frankly it's too expensive and out and reach\nI'm there wasn't going to be a series of repeated tax increases but he had called for now he didn't sound great saying yes let's raise the the corporate taxes but for round as soon as his repeatedly charge it there'll be other tax hikes and I thought that a good job\nOf beating that attack back\n... ... ... but didn't numbers do show and then when it comes to release murders over the last few years even last year Tallahassee was the main ringleader um for the cities in the state of Florida\nCorrect and and and for him to ignite a while he didn't exactly acknowledge that uh he did use\nOr his other statistics to say that crime is going down and it has but Tallahassee is still very very dangerous place and you know murders murders were up last year we had the the daughter of an Orlando city commissioner\nWas murdered last year in Tallahassee so I mean it's definitely something that has a hit home in that case has not been solved yet either here's I might mention\nHere's one Gillum said about the issues of guns in Florida clip number\nTwo the congressman was against the piece of legislation because he his old wholly owned by the n._r._a. or he's not going to stand up to the national Rifle Association that's why they're running all these ads against me because they want the man that they bought\nA in my case we're prepared to stand up for the n._r._a. they sued me they drew me to court for two years all because we said we would not allow guns to be shot in a city park\nRadical that you cannot shoot guns in a park for our kids play in our family picnic that's why people are so incensed by their step because common sense and decency seem not to be able to\nYou know I could spend an hour I mean not an out what they're talking about here my and I think you've covered this I mean there's it goes well beyond you know you got big you got big ah parks in central Florida\nMiles upon miles long where kids can go swimming in a pond in about a mile away there was a gun range inside of a heavy area that's heavily barriers and everything else and is that mighty I've already got some but thank you know take more thank you so anyways and\nAnd and what are you saying this is all the n._r._a. wanted to have guns like Mike if you and your family wanted that means I could tell them I with my four ten of golden guy tried to shoot a squirrel going up a tree in the city park that is just absurd\nTo and if you but if you wanted to to carry a weapon in part to protect you and your family mean wouldn't that wouldn't wouldn't that be the same\nThing yes agreement necessarily to shoot it but\nI mean that's what that's what Andrew Gillum was talking about stopping there\nIs you having the ability to protect your family so um you know nobody's winning on the n._r._a. issue I mean people are back in to their corners\nOn the n._r._a. one way or the or whether they want to take your guns away or whether they want to hold onto their guns very tightly that issue is not moving voters in a large direction what is moving voters and what I thought was by far Rhonda ... best moment of the night\nWas talking about this Medicare for all\nA expansion that Andrew Gillum was talked about how it would take away your current health insurance\nIf your employees if you're on Medicare currently if you're in the military currently a just a just he talked about a large majority of the people losing their current health insurance and I thought that was by far run a fan of his most effective most\nOkay my son and former chief political correspondent for Fox News out of Orlando he is the senior political reporter one of the best for Florida daily dot com again if Florida daily dot com where was the Santa is or if he was strong overall ... was there any weak points\n[laughter] well I mean I certainly think that the if you were watching it on television\nSomebody's got to stop him from smearing and making those looks on his face because the camera is always on them and I don't think it it quits will ask for him to be making the faces are doing the laughing ... and in some cases the interruptions were effective\nBut but probably less interruptions but definitely the facial expressions I thought her run to finish the they didn't make him look gubernatorial if you will\nHere's a little bit on the um uh this whole conversation about the FBI let me play a little clip about this about whether uh whether or not any of ah Gillum buddies are being investigated clip number fourteen view\nA start with you a merry go on the FBI has been investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign ... refer you Adam Corey even trying to distance yourself from Korea but you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation how clean can Floridians trust his judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and ah the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is a I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government and what we\nThe FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government and what we have done is we welcome the man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI\nBy All right so Mike without getting I mean you can if you want ... what is this story I mean about traps about weather out there we continue redevelopment agency campaign donors were given favors by government money I mean Mike you you've covered that story report before anything new about this whole FBI investigation and to Andrew Gillum\nYou know I think it was all the same territory but uh I think that you're going the way round the Santa demanded the receipts with sort of the right way to go or taking the ... you know who paid who who pay to get you into Hamilton I think was was ineffective line of attack I also thought the Gillum did a good job countering\nLet's run to finish this travel records but but what's going on here is this\nCommunity redevelopment agencies are in the center of most city yeah and their their own little tax school and they're a cesspool not just the tax bill um give a ways\nTo developers and the government I mean just anti business large and small and a ... and to other companies that do contract with governments consultants across the across the way so you know the FBI is in there to say can we get them to illegally give us some of this money\nAnd uh I mean that's as far as I'm concerned I mean it looks like it's ... ... and he said not sound that the government itself but I mean I'm not convinced of that I'm not convinced that there aren't members inside of the government of Tallahassee that wind up guided out of this investigation\nMike I could ask you an important question I think this would favor the Republicans excluding Tallahassee but the storm reports that are sitting back the secretary of state says are trying to make everything much smoother they're going to keep early voting\nOpen longer all the way up to election day a lot of those votes are assuming when you look at the track record would vote for the Republican even the north Florida Democrats you've covered this\nUh exclude Tallahassee for a second uh it does is disparage a lot of the veterans out there because of what happened with hurricane Michael\nCan they make up those voters this bad news for the Republicans have been a lot of those people are still kind of out of place\nYeah I think it's bad news for the Republicans if you you know if you look at the number of people that are just this place right now and it's not a large percentage of the overall vote but it's a it's a Republican stronghold where now people are saying you know do I have time for that do have concern about that when I don't have power would I don't have a home\nOr when I'm going to be away for a couple of weeks how do I like I didn't ask for an absentee ballot 'cause I plan on voting on a ledge and it's right so now what do I do um so I think it does benefit the Democrats and the Republicans are gonna have to work to overcome it\nBut again it's not a large percentage of the little boat it's just a place where Republicans had already counted on racking up big margins so they've got to figure out can they figure out how to get some of these people back in interest it again and and do they have the time and and mechanism with which to vote\nSenior political reporter for Florida daily down combat Florida daily dot

B. B.\nLet's get to it a lot of people want to comment on ... and just sent to get into all that in a little bit but I Want to honor newsmakers line at lunch political columnist and commentator a manager tells it the way it is entertaining what the Florida\nRadio network so this debate it took Sunday night between Andrew Gillum Enron disadvantages um as you say Gillum won the debate but there's a catch to it and what is an ad\nOr kill 'em one and then he's brilliant at just staring at the camera looking dead pan right in the eyes and wind through his teeth but he was so convincing at it that there's no doubt\nIf you're ... you're wrong supporter you absolutely wrong on you the best he could\nThis debate with not for you if your Gillum supporter while you were voting for many ways the date was not for you this debate for all of that sick offense who have no clue what they're doing when it comes to voting on all these amendments that we have here in Florida and I'll tell you what the other one was the most convincing if you have no clue that he was like\nWell I was um we're as Ron his strongest off work at the Gillum where it was Ron his what feature what she was more powerful on\nHe likes Trump I mean he finally came back the trumpet embrace them I mean that literally he told the truth but he couldn't he couldn't really explain what it was raining\n... matter in order to convince people that he was telling the truth I mean he made about climate change these right about the taxes he's right about the crime rate to ... when he was convincing\nWhere it was convincing on every lie that he\nGave me an issue I have my own here give me an issue and maybe we'll see something different Wednesday night's debate that a deal on ... was the strongest aren't they just said to shoot him knock it out of the ballpark but he did not what what topic\nWell I mean obviously there on on taxes or climate control on the crime rate I mean you know and and we're dealing with the most strong absolutely\nKnocked out of the park was on health care\nWhere he was you know talking at the heart strains of they're already in public saying look we want to make sure that their preexisting conditions will not prohibit you and your family from getting the treatment that you need we're going to make you got no way to pay for this\nWell that's not true he wants to raise everyone tax everyone that this through the roof forty percent additional on businesses Florida start as state income tax I mean that that several times I think four times while he was there\nWell here's what let's play a little clip from Sunday night here was Andrew Gillum on his Medicaid expansion in Florida to\nHelp to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one in the Florida Senate under Republican control\nOf an effort that my opponent oppose this\nOr if we expand Medicaid given the state of Florida we will a sin access to health care for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridians eight hundred thousand and by doing state will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other things because we philosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care\nYou know it kind of interesting he made the point where he says the majority of Republicans a few years back in the state Senate and not the Democrat the Republican controlled on state Senate\nHeavily overwhelmingly supported Medicaid expansion in this state and idea to Braga Obama wanted to push through and many other states and let me tell you something that he goes down that road and set up a little bit I think that can be damaging to the same just brand\nOh absolutely but let's look at Medicaid expansion needy people\nThe only people who are already getting medicate so line number one\nNumber two well you know what six million dollars that would come in from the federal government medicate it's funded by the part of the federal government or by the state government it's basically a fifty fifty match so when we're talking about six\nBillion dollars coming in from the government that because that ... billion dollar filming it from the state I mean this guy lie after lie after lie\nBut he wrapped up in such a little cat it with a beautiful little on it and then at the very end which is grandma that

reason why we need Medicaid expansion folks\nListen wow listen to how we explain to hell with a boost up the economy\nThousand and by doing that will be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states because we\nPhilosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care of their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or

W. B. up and get off the couch I Love it David good morning\nYeah how are you in the morning and I\nI mentioned before that I Believe that Trump is organized crime and anybody that kisses up to him is going to be organized crime as well so um the or for that last caller given orders that I'd better obey and and the vote for reds but\nThis is not a game organized crime should that be running the FBI organized crime should that be running the military organized crime shows kiss up to take king's\nNow we're going to your mind is Hassan ... the organized crime is looking to go after Trump with impeachment what are you talking about\nUh\nThe FBI Romney on the east side of the runner up\nWhat are you saying\nTrump is not a fan of the FBI\n\nOr courses nod he's trying to stack the deck and he's trying to get up the eye people fired so he can stack the deck with organized\nCrime okay we just had a few moments ago that that did that the that the Trump Administration was running the FBI the organized crime was running that\nA little I didn't say\nThat I heard that a correct that came to mind is\nHe he does not he does not you know the FBI would love to excuse me organized crime would love to to ruin the FBI right you organized crime would love to run banking organized crime already runs hazardous waste dumps\nHim already running up to the ...\nWhat's the difference we'd organized crime and whether it's a Republican or Democrat let me just ... to make it fair what's the difference between organized crime and the government\nWell when you're trying to say that organized crime as political like Democrat or Republican no organized crime\nOut for the money for the money out for the power\nThere to you know they'll put a funny name in front of themselves or you know I had a grandfather that was a Republican my mother's or a Democrat I personally am Green Party ah I Try to stay scientific\nYou know I don't try to pay attention to fake economic standards that organized ... have you ever read those biographies a judge or Hoover yeah\nIn in the ones that came out in the Nineteen nineties the early nineties they described it ate Jagger who\nCame out in the Nineteen nineties the early nineties they described it ate Jagger Hoover and he was the head of the FBI he discovers that organized crime is buying into Wall Street\nThey're buying shares in Wall Street to the extent of two and a half percent per year they're buying two and a half percent at Wall Street per year in ten years turn that would add up to two twenty five percent\nAnd by the way the FBI got into bed with organized crime we've read about that as well but he'll ask a quick what you're talking about the the the the ... I I don't want to put words in your mouth you talked about economics what is what is wrong with the economics today organized crime with the economy I'm trying to follow you on that\nWhat's wrong with it nothing would be true\n... what do we have to take numbers out there with the economy\nWell did you ever study what happened with Enron yeah Enron was using a company called Arthur Andersen which was totally fully right only phony they ... they and Arthur Andersen they've gotten so big and so powerful that they were managing\nAgain that but what is the ... I went up only what what is the fake economic numbers now\nWho's Enron even Noel\nIt it just comes down to the governor's race all the do the governors or near the governor candidates believe and do they believe in global warming and are they worried a jump start budgeting money toward shelters\nToward highways that are not going to be washed out a bridges or they\nHave a new set of Hank said to have a lot of rise level also in the city of Miami I but I'm trying to get back to the economic numbers here I'm trying to find where these fake and I was going on\nThat's that's what I'm saying if these guys don't believe in global warming then they're going to give us fake numbers to keep their their\nFaith ... by the front of economic numbers stuff where you keep saying if I'm just trying to ask what are these fade economic numbers you mentioned\nWell for example if the costs to repair and moves after every year is going to be magnified every year then you'd better have some solid numbers if you're going to pretend that global warming is not happening I end up with\nAn entertainment the environment taco ... is the GDP fake or the tax cuts Vegas spending the stimulus I mean that's what I'm trying to get to when you talk about the economic numbers\nWell yeah the obviously the tax break is a fake uh because most of these uh you you learn about what colony\nEconomics was in Seventeen Seventy six where the king was sucking all the money out of America and it was going straight to London when you were all was being starved back here\nSo the American revolution Seventeen Seventy six was based on the idea that we didn't want foreign powers looting us since suck it all the money back to their headquarters no organized crime is basically doing that\nI listen to Kelly I'm trying man\nI listen to guy sounds very polite I'm trying to keep up here we talk about the economic numbers but then we're going off the global warming I ask\nAbout taking 'em numbers now have you with the governor's race in global I'm just I'm just asking guys just please just stand point here the king of England in Seventeen Seventy six I asked about the current economic numbers right now\nHe's conservative said that the economic numbers were fake under Obama I always ask me tell me what numbers aren't adding up the same question I'm asking with Trump if you're making the accusation didn't tell me what numbers are adding up out there\nBecause even the Democrats admitted the economic numbers are good but they just say it's not doing overall for everybody and this guy's Green Party guy should ask my dislike about the Democrats your calls a more coming up next on TALK radio W.

B. O. B.\nContact and being shown on AM six hundred and one on one of them are going to to to to to to find my email and you know quite how\nPresident wants to make the point that the economy is doing extremely well and that really fine performance of the economy is not being covered by the establishment the conventional media yeah by the way\nThose numbers were fake I'm telling you the media would cover that if somebody was Enron in the numbers and pleading the numbers in case he good morning you're on WB or be\nA good morning how are you doing hey good morning\nSo two items are within the last guy he kept asking about the numbers era where whether that numbers add up to numbers have an added up in this country a long time to take a look at our national debt every number we put together some track something so they can fudge the numbers all they want this country has a massive debt\nWhich is not being addressed that like you said it's going to be a title wave that could actually destroyed this guy\nWas asking the wrong question I just I just just totally what numbers don't add up what are you from the left or from the right I just want to know and then he couldn't do it I just wonder why I kept asking them\nBy either side is gonna fudge the numbers to make their party and look better it's heading back to the original point in my call is if you take a look at that uh that debate last night in our country as a teeter totter you have either one side or the other it's going to keep going up and down\nAnd then we get more of a choice than two people\nThis country is never going to find that equal balance it's always going to be swayed one way or another\nWas a real quick was Trump that choice\nI I think Trump or is it the best choice right we haven't had a good choice in this country in decades\nOr so here's the ... you know I I appreciate the call making a valid point maybe because nobody's going to go down third party they have to invade the Republican Party like Trump did ... and Bernie Sanders did exactly more decide talk radio W. B. O. B. [noise]\nBeing Don a and that's Donald Trump or neglecting all sense of reason in fact uh I preside over a city that is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate on trajectory to be at a twenty year low and our crime rate and no matter a brief statement at project or even twenty your\nCrime will come on folks who does that\nHave to say is going to change the fact that the CNN or Fox you have to bring facts to the conversation record them in an area for now our case we are the largest city in our twenties type of thing crime that they're going to vote on the underlying than so to Sanders kept saying do you have a record murders last year what Florida voters understand is\nThat communities will experience crime adjust in Jacksonville earlier today ... people shot the question is I'm sure of\nMarijuana carries a lot just to me it's like why do you have to bring up Jacksonville again I've got a probably a bit heated ... coming up\nWhat are we going to do about it and what I'm going to do is take on the n._r._a. and hold them responsible for the rent and crime and I'll\nGet paid way through the end now is to blame for the murders that are taking place it can I ask a question folks that maybe I just missed it and if I did please correct me did the n._r._a. cause the six shootings that happened over the weekend\nMy suspicion of course they're still investigating use if there were not in a hurry members who were involved no no no no they don't have\nTo be an already members Roger ... how the end or it used to be blamed where does he can already be blamed for this\nGosh you know what I Would have to wait for the investigation come out but I doubt that there was actually any type of direct calls or even in direct\nThere was a Andrew Gillum on his proposed Medicaid expansion in it\nThat helped to pass a Medicaid expansion in this state or by thirty nine to one and the Florida Senate under Republican control of an effort that my opponent opposes or if we expand Medicaid given the state of Florida we will a fin access to health care over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy Floridian\nThat is not the case of a now if you being kicked off because of your insurance premiums through the rates going up that's happened because of Obamacare that hasn't been truly done away with yet you get kicked off your health care plan you're on a state run Medicaid\nOkay and yet\nHe doesn't even talk about I'm not saying to end the Sanders hadn't even call them out on us that's yeah I get more emails about that this morning Roger how come the sentences and calling him out okay maybe it's the next debate I don't know but yet there are no work requirements are aren't what about the ages on that\nWhat else do you plan to do for this eight hundred thousand and by doing they won't be able to pull down six billion dollars from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nBecause six billion he's talking about what the feds come in and say we'll pay for the first three years old but after that you got to pick up eight percent of the tap oh wait we don't have enough money after you could pick up ten percent of the tap Roger wait a second\nI mean what have you ever knew the feds to pay for everything had to pay for all the Medicaid has taken place now and many of the states now has ... and ... correct on this so it was just ... has the fed to pay for the environmental cleanup on federal property know\nHave they done all this no\nAnd you you're going to rely on them to pay for all the cost of Medicaid expansion here in Florida\nWe philosophically disagree with uh getting access to health care or their hospitals to walk this they're doctors or nurses association we can build photos economies simply by extending access to health care and guess\nWhat how do you like that we can build the economy by more government intervention through Medicaid expansion\nNot only good for those uh eight hundred thousand people will get access it's also good for folks like me and for small businesses\nSo that was asked his was what to Santa said about his proposal\nPeople need to know these answers for this concept Medicare for all which is a euphemism because if you read it it actually about what's his Medicare for seniors Medicare Advantage\nIt abolished his try care and I was a veteran I Know that military families depend on it if you get your insurance through your employer abolish as that and it dumps all those people against their will regardless of what they want to stay in their current plan it dumps them on a single payer government system Pakistan's\nHas also brings up the point of what will happen if you tried to expand Medicaid here in the state of Florida\nSays will go through the roof ... face fiscal difficulties it will hemorrhage money and then the government will choose who get the care and who does that when you talk about this coverage what does that coverage you get to the fact is with Medicaid expansion people didn't have access to doctors most physicians do not accept new medicate take\nAnd what are you going to force him on that trip to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five I don't know of dissent just hit the\nBall park but really don't know I think there's a lot more than the talk about the FBI isn't that what they talk about Trump what about the specific to talk about education no maybe next Wednesday night we talked about high crime I get it taxes\nThe ...
