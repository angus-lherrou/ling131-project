B. O. B.\nAnd here are the top stories were bringing you this morning Florida and other states show Republicans will believe when it comes to early voting has Democrats downplay your blue wave\nWith a mega millions lottery jak part of the record one point six billion dollars some are asking of all the money is really going to education\nAnd round two of the Florida governor's debate is tonight at seven pm to contact and the\nCamp Six and one more call to to to\nTo five ... ... email to me I\nDo not play the lotto I refused to play the lottery I just it's just no investment and the worst ... unfortunately ... heads is poor people were going to get to that a few moments you but there I guess a lot at one point six billion sold in South Carolina\nYeah someone so they're pretty much set but the chances of actually winning you're you're actually a stronger chance of being struck by lightning\nYeah maybe some people do need to be struck by lightning Everytime they take their tax a tax payer money or or paycheck by the way a good morning everybody three minutes after the top of the hour Eddie here along with Roger Anderson I guess sold in South Carolina out there just by the way do you know if you went to one point six do you know how much actually you get\nA nine hundred and Thirteen they almost taking a billion ... billion or a million would be a million by one point six\nI think they were taking over that if you want to get one a one time payout you it's less but if you want to get a credible payments over Thirty years then you get the full amount but then there's the ... even count taxes\nBrown number two tonight for the big debate hey so there was on the front page of Yahoo News this morning about that race is that this has been going on in other states where there somebody's in or impersonating Andrew Gillum using some sort of you know ... black boys stereotypical is what they're saying ...\nBad grammar and the jungle music playing a background calling Florida voters is if it's going to change\nHis she'd do we have that clip the just stupid I think people listen to what a bunch of these I mean what is a bunch of high schoolers that water they off last night to the drive through work or what\nSomething similar was actually a couple of months ago ed and it was actually traced to a white supremacist group out of state so um I'll I'll look for the clip and see if we could fight if\nWe're going to get the club [noise] All right dean Roger Henderson good to have you here with his here's the latest early voting is up about a million votes Roger been cast it in the state of Florida\nEarly building up with the Republicans in taxes way up in Tennessee but does this mean anything here with the latest on that Fox News' Mike Emanuel\nOf President Trump has been active out on the stump trying to stop what many experts have predicted could be a blue wave\nNow even NBC News is saying the wave could be purple with GOP affiliated voters surpassing democratic affiliated in early voting in seven key states recent polling also suggests that brutal fight over justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation has energized voters on both sides\nSome experts caution that both parties have really emphasize getting their voters to cast their ballots early so it may not support as much as the two parties are backing it ahead of election day\nAnd yet that Democrats are downed plane a blue wave based on the early vote that they see and many of these states Matt Gorman from the Republican National committee says actually already betting his way up the Republican vote\nIs up a democratic turnout was low Republican travel especially in the suburban battleground districts his top aides looking like a normal mid term electric I Know there's talk of the blue waiver massive democratic turnout at least in the early ... doesn't seem to be that way right now\nAgain Democrats downplaying the blue wave from the DNC the Democratic National Committee mayor of Kelly\nDenies that she and I never ... neither very difficult district and there's a lot of outside money that can play a very significant role in these races we believe it will be closing within a few feet and whether we win or lose the majority of ...\nTo me a wave is the waves but then again okay I guess right holding me call it my senior I guess that we're going to look at some antics a mini wave a massive wave ... a blue wave of blue ripple now or are they downplay into right now what do you think\nI think they are and I think part of the reason for that I think they're confident that the Democrats are going to do well in most racist ... but I think they don't want to give the voters too much confidence because that well maybe maybe maybe some people will stay home if they think they've got it so that's probably why they're not not really towel to get a whole lot\nRemote at three from Georgetown Institute of politics says you know a he's a big lead he was a big uh that for the state of Florida covered with the Obama campaign of two thousand eight he says you know don't be dismayed because it you know it ... this cannot be a massive blue wave because it can be just as many blue\nWaves if you look at where they are today\nHeading into today um compared to this point\nFour years ago and the last midterm uh Republicans last time I had about a nearly nine point advantage in the early vote coming in today right now they're having nearly a four point advantage coming into that [laughter]\nSo they're shows that Democrats are narrow in the early vote gap in a major state like Florida would and most people project Democrats will pick a late in the early voting after today's votes are counted but let's make no mistake anyone on the Democratic side that things that we're going to be a boost the nominee\nNeeds to check their expectations I think that are going to be more like a mini wave\nCan be more like him anyway but if you do notice they see even with early voting Democrats will probably surpass that number let me one time one more time just to not just for a little education 'cause a lot of people emails Roger sewing why only reason why we're bringing this issue what would you bring it up the more than education without going overloaded here\nTwenty five thousand more Democrats requested absentee has the first time it's happened for many years here in the state of Florida yes early voting the Republicans have a lead but that doesn't mean that it's a ... a bad against Democrat just a lot of people that turned him back in yet\nAnd they could turn back at the moment now baby toward the close to be election day or maybe even vote on election day so it's important to get out and vote\nEven conservative commentator the senior editor for the federal smiling Hemingway says even if you look at the results of two thousand sixteen which shows it early voting was going to benefit Hillary Clinton both parties should not be taking this as a victory lap\nI don't mean too much into early voting I remember in twenty six clone we were told that Hillary Clinton how to come forward and based on camera and she ended up taking for that so it's interesting that a lot of people are voting early but I don't know how much we can take from that\nThey don't know how much they can take from it right there from Fox News says states like Georgia and other states\nTake from it Brett Baer from Fox News says states like Georgia and other says that are you ready for this the supervisor of elections are throwing away ballots based on mine are technicalities\nMixture where there tonight and judge hears arguments over allegations Georgia officials are unfairly throwing out early voting balance because of extremely technical issues to lawsuits claimed thousands of votes are being discounted over signatures that do not appear to match those on file because of the voter owes signed on the wrong line now\nThat is an interesting ... that if you if that's been a big discrepancy with elections supervisor that wait a second I'm\nTheir signatures don't match I understand that but let's be honest so they signed a loyal to you in the wrong spot come out a lot of people aren't sure what what's got some people can't and find out with a children's side of the menu was when they take their kids with a local restaurant\nA consumer sentiment and small business confidence has soared had before I had a civilian recovery and it can take the most amazing thing\nYou know I I all I ask and I use this word a lot in the morning show an afternoon shows that you listen to another morning shows and talk yeah people are all over the map\nOkay and the question I like to ask is\nIt ... the consistency I'm always asking if and when you ask the Democrats just give me how do you explain the difference between the Obama economy and the Trump academy well Trump inherited a good economy okay how do you explain more tax revenues coming in how to explain more companies spending more money ... explained the consumer confidence is up\nHow to explain what women and businesses now than ever how do you explain that the national federation of Independent Business as more people are looking at starting up franchises than ever before and you talk I'm just asking just just becomes just let me give me a good conversation\nHere and you haven't even mentioned the fact that a lot of these companies on their own or increasing their own internal minimum wages for new hires right places like Amazon and other companies the thousand dollar bonuses a lot of people got the end of last year and he talked about insurance rates going down\nI honestly don't think that's very honest rich rates have been going up and so has copayments and uh it would be the cost to the doctor\nI can I ask an interesting question for all the Starbucks groups out there that had by the way who are do not um I Do not condoned the policies that President Trump course he did admit that the tax\nCuts the lab and get more benefits that of Amazon and Google and um I just asked him a question I'm not trying to be a smart ... Amazon has a lot of jobs in Florida Orlando and also in Jacksonville\nWanting you guys do this six thousand dollar bonuses when President Obama was in the White House why didn't you guys expand that Fifteen bucks an hour when President Obama's win the White House it\nWas really because of the ... good Trump tax cuts that I Would\nLook at USA I wouldn't disagree with you but I'm just saying that he gets credit for all of the many of these companies didn't do all\nThe oil for as my homework I've been doing a CPA about if there was apparently some new wants them to tax law which I don't get that if they had not given out those bonuses\nThey would have had to pay that money in federal taxes have to say I am and that was the one year deal and if you didn't get a thousand dollar bonuses because your employer doesn't have tax accounting and attorneys on staff that study this big law that came out big big grain of sand got the money gets to\nThe caravan like that hurricane coming across the Atlantic ocean it's going to hit somewhere the caravan still coming on board could be thirty to forty days\nRoberts from Fox News says if you notice Dems are actually staying away from this issue\nPresident is placing blame for the caravan anti illegal immigration in general except for the Democratic party\nDemocrats want to know part of the immigration battle hoping to change the subject and the next two weeks to issues the things they can win on like health care that got an immigration the department of homeland security today announced immigration numbers for the month after September ... September\nOr they can forty one thousand illegal immigrants were apprehended on the southern border that brought the yearly total for fiscal year Tony Eighteen to nearly four hundred thousand\nWhich is a thirty percent increase over the previous year\nKind of curious without trying to blame it on the gems why do you think immigration policy is made illegal immigration is up makes you wonder I don't have an answer for it yeah I mean the countries that are coming from that bad yeah\nAnd especially considering the fact that Trump has been really hard liner when it comes to legal immigration there still coming in droves\nBig issue you guys ready for this one point six billion dollars in the lottery sold in South Carolina\nBut yet Leland bitter what a great story folks listen to this this is they always say when it comes to the issue of education and money points out when you look at the study is that how the lottery money is spent and those that are buying the tickets may or may not surprise you\nAnd industry trade group says Americans saying eighty billion a year on the lottery more than a Starbucks Donald's Burger King and Taco Bell combined\nThe jackpot remained elusive to many some of the money they spend on their dreams ends up in their states coffers each state receives roughly thirty cents on the dollar of tickets sold twenty plus states earmarked for education research in California and Florida and Michigan shows this trend despite promotion that the ...\nResearch in California and Florida and Michigan shows this trend despite promotions that the lottery boost education spending\nIn North Carolina it's called the education lottery but inflation adjusted education spending her people in the Tar Heel state is actually down\nIn other states the money goes over the place in Colorado is funded by our mental protection in Kansas part of their lotto hall fun juvenile detention facilities West Virginia somebody funds and Medicare Iowa envy the free lotto income like any other tax dollars\nThese extra dollars come from those can least afford it bank re dot com study found that household to making less than thirty thousand dollars a year for a hundred and twelve dollars that it won the lottery or times ... wealthiest households\nNow those who say well we don't want to expand gambling because it hurts poor people okay take great argument we have current gambling and you just to the report it still hurts the poor people knew the government should we eliminate that it'd be a ... argument\nThat says we should ah you know we we don't want to expand that got to be here so we believe that Yeah Richard devote\nFrom Williams College you're using it for education but the money that they had earmarked for education is going to other places\nSo they'll where is the lottery money going to you\nIs it going to Florida education because I I think that when people go with a lot of money has early God I think this destroys the argument Roger for those that advocate offshore drilling expansion of gambling oh by the way for all the teachers' unions out there that support it state income tax here in Florida so it's going to go for education I don't think anybody buys into this anymore\nNot at all what ends up happening and you've talked about the money that was previously going to education is now being spent on something else in the lottery money is going to education more as we can do you need to move along tripled to talk tripled to eight to five five talk radio W.

B. dot top\nSo let's get to it as we continue to move along Rogers some of the people that have ah listen to this radio show\nHave talked about the amendments a lot of the amendments Thirteen amendments are very confusing to ban dog track greyhound's from whatever also to whether or not it was more a exemption for tax cuts whether or not the local municipality should have their rights\nTo expand gambling or not but one of the big issues we've talked about his amendment for about whether or not sell it should get\nTheir voting rights restored a group that opposes that is Richard Harris said Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy there\nAre already people out there talking about if it makes sense to automatically restore voting rights to convicted felons [noise]\nMaybe it also makes sense to automatically restore their Second Amendment right the political issue of the day is never only about the political issue of the day it's almost always about what's coming next are we talking about\nA non violent selling\nVersus a career violent criminals\nAre we talking about a first time selling or somebody who's a a twenty year\nThe amendment doesn't allow anybody to ask those questions\nSo in other words I guess what he's bringing up the point is what becomes next because if this becomes a constitutional measure in order to revamp it has to be voted in by the public set right now you've got to do another one okay are we going to lessen the crimes that climate see I mean what's next the question is is somewhere asking if we go down this road Roger\nThen why I Know there's already some in the constitution but if you want to revamp some of the criminal reforms\nWhether it's the Republicans or Democrats why are they not taking this up as a ...\nYeah it's a ... they could do this already I I think there's this tendency to want to kick the can down the road especially when it comes to a controversial issue because then as someone who can be pigeonholed if you take them a certain side which can be hurting the political\nJohn Roberts from Fox News the caravan continues to come but with the two thousand and Eighteen veterans right around the corner he says Democrats are avoiding this issue\nThe president is placing blame for the caravan and illegal immigration in general it's a foot in the Democratic party Democrats want to know part of the immigration battle hoping to change the subject in the next two weeks to issues they say they can win on like health care\nThat got an immigration the department of homeland security today announced immigration numbers for the month of September ... September\n... more than forty one thousand illegal immigrants were apprehended on the southern border that brought the yearly total for fiscal year Tony Eighteen to nearly four hundred thousand which is a thirty percent increase over the previous here\nHere's a question I ask you if it's if it's in the Democrats' best interests to get more individuals coming in this country to vote Democrat\nBut let's go beyond that to be humane then why are they not campaigning on this issue then should we not be humane should we not have open arms again it was just so popular among the voters out there rock and all the other stuff out there I Know doc is a little different from that and\nDidn't why not have it with open arms if the polls are correct about the majority of people want to be show love and kindness to those uh come across this country illegally by the way\nBeing shown loving time is is different than you know a lot of the flood of people to come into the country the mice especially will be there's probably enough people who wants to be shown loving time is maybe where they are so they don't have the motivation to have to come here\nBut the question is are these people I mean are they say who they say they are ... even if you have a few bad apples that does spoil the barrel somewhat say Martha McConnell them from the story says according to the Washington Post who is along with the caravan go figure that um a lot of these people that are coming over have already been deported multiple times\nSo I was a report today than that Washington ... ... is that many people that they talk to the Washington Post talked to tell their important that they had already been deported several times in the United states and that they were going to try to make it back in again many of them to try to meet up with family members\nAnd try to run in between the border guards at places that they know are poor that's all I mean I didn't think border and one of them was quoted as saying that's how it is a cat and you try to get back what what kind of his ... is that\nMore as we continue to move along when it comes to the issue of early voting now about a million people over I think that as of today have already voted Roger\nThe question is who's benefitting the Democrats say wall percentage wise we're up they have some accuracy tobacco plant in the early voting has already taken place which does benefit a lot of Democrats somewhat also sit back and say here's the latest in several key states like Florida Tennessee and Texas Fox News' Mike Emanuel President Trump\nDebate prep with it\nCovers for years as we're journalists were number one don't make the funny faces ... yeah I mean Ron I like you you look at your concert do you look at your backed up\nOkay who wouldn't go that far do you know I mean that that's what some of the people to the support of town I mean I like riding in case it didn't affect run once you put Casey up there to debate how did you have a debate buzzer very nice on Andrew Gillum side and then Rhonda Casey to Santa's we can't around this morning show but\n... and you just that was Andrew Gillum the mayor of Tallahassee who claims to be but most most progressive candidate even among the Democrats\nHe says he's a capitalist here's the question I Would like to ask what part of capitalism is in\nAnd Andrew combined was a nice guy but what part of capitalism is in the blood of Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum\nWho wants to raise taxes on the corporate airy forty percent which there isn't enough money which means you have to raise it somewhere else he wants to expand that minimum wage automatically from eight whatever it is a twenty five eight thirty five to Fifteen bucks an hour but he's not looking out for small business says\nHe wants to have the Medicaid expansion but isn't going to tell you how he's paying for that what what part of all that it invokes capitalism that I'd like to ask you to pay for all this Andrew\nYeah and and will people be looking at the issues are they're going to look at style or remember the Kennedy mixing debate history lessons how Kennedy look so cruel comic elective\nA mix and looks a little bit stressed out that release you know ... ... a really it's in the direction of the of the uh the voting towards Kennedy are the people look bad or they actually listening to the ...\nWell that's that's what I Want to get I mean ... if you're going to play all of that yeah I mean but the question is is he keeps saying that again I I I Am a I'm a capitals when it comes to that\nWay from college I Am on the stage as the most progressive candidate running for governor and the only non millionaire non billionaire\n... justice was asking this question about these these titles out there\nThey Democrat socialist Steve call yourself the most progressive than the race did that just a moment ago what is the difference between Democrat socialist socialist and a progressive Democrats explains [laughter]\nWell I can tell you what I Believe [noise] um I Believe that the labels are insignificant when it comes to the everyday lives of people in this day and so I realized that these labels are are easy to throw on folks but when you're struggling a when you want to make sure that you can\nHe doesn't like labels but again he calls him so he doesn't want to call himself the most progressive\nAnd very closely associated with people who openly call themselves socialist like Bernie Sanders\nYeah he wants to him by what he he does like labels because he did call for help a capitalist out there one\nPoint six ... billions and billions of dollars a a war why hasn't been giving away yet but I guess the winning lottery ticket was in South Carolina that's not the point of this and the point is is where's all this lottery money going here in the state of Florida and other states and who was buying up all these lotto tickets breaking down Fox\nNews Leland better today and industry trade group says Americans saying eighty billion a year on the lottery more than a Starbucks Donald's Burger King and Taco Bell combined\nThe jackpot remained elusive to many some of the money they spend on their dreams ends up in their states coffers each state receives roughly thirty cents on the dollar of tickets sold\nTwenty plus states earmarked for education research in California and Florida and Michigan shows this trend despite promotion that the lottery\nBruce education spending\nIn North Carolina it's called the education lottery but inflation adjusted education spending per pupil in the Tar Heel state is actually down right\nBefore I go back to this so again we have all the lottery money out there we have all of this and it again on both sides well the Republicans may argue there's enough money and the Democrats but other of when you look at what's been going on there\nSome would say there isn't enough money even with the lottery system I want to Roger before I get back to this\nDoes this just qualify the argument by having a offshore drilling expansion of gambling maybe an income tax or maybe the income taxes\nOr the uh corporate income tax a danger given wants to raise to pay for education for crying out loud to the market based system if people are buying lottery tickets and not have the money is going to education what makes you think about all these other ideas that they claim that could lower property taxes and fund education\nWell I think every every bit helps you abused will get the money it's a voluntary tax people are voluntarily choosing to pay more money the government as far as going to education what's happened is that prior to build a lottery certain amount of money was a allocated for education they said the lottery is going to add to that instead of adding to it they took away that money and use the lottery\nMoney you know I wasn't the same bill of goods sold with Social Security is this another Ponzi scheme\nIn other states the money goes over the place in Colorado at funds environmental protection in Kansas part of their lotto hall fun juvenile detention facilities West Virginia somebody funds and Medicare Iowa envy the free lotto income like any other tax dollars\nAfter another question who would say that your chances of winning in Port I don't play lottery just complete waste of money All right\nYour chances of winning in Port I don't play lottery just complete waste ... All right um uh if you could if your chances of winning could go up and let's say they came back and say hey this this lottery money isn't a fund education it's not going to fund fireplace would that stop you from playing lotto\nThat's a good question it probably would not stop told here's another question who's paying the most\nThe the for the lottery system out there who's buying up all the tickets\nThese extra dollars come from those can least afford it bank re dot com study found that household and making less than thirty thousand dollars a year for a hundred and twelve dollars of it won the lottery four times before I was so wealthiest households and\nHow much is it for a lot of chicken was at a buck dollars going by I don't know\nBooks for you to spend four hundred bucks a year ...\nThat's more than a dollar plus per day you know four hundred bucks a year well you know you do a lot with extra four hundred bucks per year or a nice little Christmas having said that so he doesn't matter what color you are it's poor income families lesson thirty thousand thirty thousand dollars or less\nSo if we don't want you expand gambling not advocating it I'm just saying the argument is we don't expand gambling because it's regressive because poor people right and why would you let them continue to play a current gambling exist in ... I'm just asking\nYou can't stop people from doing something that's legal in the United states as long as ... okay so then you would you do would you advocate and put you on the spot into Udall is no let me hear from you a triple to talk\nNine to report trip up to eight to five five who do out there even my church going conservative friends oh probably about a very valuable argument to sit back and says that we should not do it because it hurts the pork\nFine let's go along with that argument would you also put limitations on lottery system which means that should we check people's incomes before they buy a lottery ticket I Can't see how they can be done I mean you know the show up at the argument a lot of conservatives are you I'm not slam the aren't a lot of argument conservatives are you going to show\nUp at the store with a copy of your ten forty to prove your income I don't see how that could reinforce\nYeah I mean there's a lot of people on on ... drive open escalates yeah that's true I mean how are you how are we going to prove that want to hear from you a triple to talk triple to eight to five five talk radio W.

Rochester\nClock swimming debate starts live from a baby Florida Broward College\nGillum versus just than just round to here's a question or going to get with our guests also but I Want to ask you because I'm dying to hear from the audience this morning as I Am every morning you listening [noise]\nIf you do I'm not talking one of these he let me ride it out in the in the moderator gets asked a question I'm Talking you you're on TV you get to Mike you could ask Andrew Gillum a campaign or Ron just answered the question\nYou asked him a question on the campaigns what statement would you make or what question would you ask tonight if your voice to be hurt tripled you talk nine zero for tripled you eight to five five Jim good morning you're on WB obey\nThe morning how are you hey good morning next awaiting good\nMy question would be to kill them and it would be a two part question the first one we were just up or down yes no are you a socialist\nThe reason why I Would ask says because of the second question would be if you are\nIf you because you know you're going to answer no of course a second\nQuestion is why did you have Bernie Sanders come to the state one month ago as stumped for him through all of the major university\nAll right that's a valid question\nHere on her dues make it on David caught news the business reporter for jak daily record jak daily record dot com\nIn the studio with us ah my good friend Kevin dirty who's the editor for Florida daily dot com or ... maybe start with you David you get the debate tonight if you can ask a question you were moderating the debate David what would you ask\nAnd I think I I think in the morning at I think what I Would ask is you know what are you going to do for my bottom line right I'm a business owner I'm somebody who you know needs my taxes to be ... you know in place flow what're you going to do for my bottom line what sets you apart from your opponent because\nEspecially with the St is you know he he's drumming up this um this idea that Andrew Gillum is going to raise our taxes are not only just corporate taxes but you know you you know this idea that Andrew Gillum wants to push a state income tax 'em and other issues\nWhat would you ask Kevin I Would ask point blank look we've had four hundred and seven thousand jobs created in Florida in the past year half of those are construction and tourism jobs\nWe know where that leads we saw that ten years ago when the great recession it means Florida is gonna get whacked if the national economy goes in the tank tourism dollars vanish new home construction real estate dollar Spanish\nHow do you diversify Florida's economy Rick stop all the time how to diversify it\nMiddle ground Harry Shearer with the mayor of the fastest growing economy for capital one of the fact of the nation\nI think all the threat is all the other thing out of range why am I on the capital\nCapital as David I Would just ask an idle throughout the socialist terminology that much out there but I Would ask them what makes them more of a capitalism that runs and Santas\nYeah absolutely I mean you knew it it's going to be hard for Andrew Gillum to to out uh I guess out capitalist Rhonda Santas I mean just from the messaging I mean you know the only thing that I guess Gillum can say is that you know he wants to\nYou know a an invigorated our school system again right he wants to to\nYou know put more money into public education or he wants to you know diversify that with you know more skill training but you know the Santa is I think wants to do that too and dissent is more about school choice but I think both sides recognize that you've got to have more skilled labor jobs out there\nAlso you know I think both of these candidates need to realize that Florida needs to be the leader and energy production or whether that solar whether that's you know diversifying or energy portfolios and some of our largest utility companies as well\nDemocrats couldn't be playing down a blue wave to the merits Kelly from the DNC says well we never predicted there was going to be this massive blue wave turnouts\nIn my position I never said there was a massive flew away that neither very difficult districts and there's a lot of outside money that can play a very significant role in these races we believe\nThere's a lot of outside money that can play a very significant role in these races we believe it will be closing within a few feet and whether we win or lose the majority Kevin\nDirty from Florida daily dot com Florida states like Tennessee in taxes the Republicans were leaning on as far as the early absentee mail out or as a but then again ... played a clip number three Mollie Hemingway conservative commentator for the federal dot com says\nWell you know maybe both parties overplay their hand remember this was supposedly the early results of Hillary Clinton in two thousand six days to\nKill my early ... and I remember in ... we were told that Hillary Clinton had a lock on Florida and based on early voting and she ended up taking for it so it's interesting that a lot of people are voting early but I don't know how much we can take from it you know how do you spend\nIs I mean is it is the second debate number one really matter of a million people who already voted number one number two Republicans are up on the early voting but does that mean as far as the abs and teacher but was not going to kind of soften up with early voting taking place now which Democrats always seem to do quite well on\nYeah and it's kind of what we always see in and look let's be very candid a risk out one of the skin of his teeth and twenty ten and twenty four big election Republican almost ... years\nThat's not where the numbers are right now I mean you know the army will say well we're doing better than we did twenty sixteen eat more okay but it's apples and oranges that says a presidential year not who've been poorly in Los Altos

I think it's a valid question David calling the issue of ice how important does that play here in the state of Florida among the gubernatorial\nWhy you know I think it according to some some polling recently it's one of the top issues for folks and look Rhonda Santa's has made that a you know one of the top things in his campaign you know uh you know we talked earlier about meeting the shed\nThis this you know a persona really only talking about national issues and ice has really the issue that can be localized as well\nAndrew Gillum has gotten a lot of heat and rightfully so especially during the last debate\nOn that he would abolish ice in its current form I'm saying you know it just doesn't work you know he says he wants to put it in you know with other law enforcement agencies hum but he has not been able to clarify their statements I think for for most ... most uh you know in ... and independents who are still on the fence who they're going to vote for\n... it's it's an interesting question but here's the thing look a and it was just me very candid about this one of the reasons immigration reform hasn't really moved as much as they should in Florida has been big business remember Rick Scott ... ten is the issue he's the best Bill McCollum with in the primary\nRepublicans kill that Republicans killed ... in Tallahassee why because big business came behind them and said no no no no no and frankly I think the same thing's going to happen with round the standards if he's elected and the Republicans keep the majority and tell us in\nJust want to remind everybody coming up on the the excuse me Kevin how to clear this up in his day Friday after Black Friday is not the Friday after Thanksgiving Thanksgiving to me it's Thursday and friday you know what I was thinking about that too [laughter] so anyway okay is it is the week is the eight days after\nThe by the way people would still show up at night after they trust with 'em but anyway it's the November the thirtieth it is the friday it's eight days the Friday after Thanksgiving and after Black Friday\nIf you want to come on and poked it's going to be afraid to all the oil listeners we've had quite a few hundred it already getting R.

B. O. B.\nAn issue yes they say it's a Trojan Horse about the humane care of animals but we already had and the constitution with the uh how you transport pig amendment from all those years ago ... years ago but here's the thing uh it I'm going to be a guy like Marion Hammer I liked the IRA a but there are far bigger battles in Iran needed to be fighting this year than amendments search team\nOf President Trump has been active out on the stump trying to stop what many experts have predicted could be a blue wave now even NBC News is saying the wave couldn't be purple with GOP affiliated voters surpassing democratic affiliated in early voting in seven states day\nBut let me ask you a quick question before I get back to the phones on the early voting as far as the abs and tease Democrats were requested more as of now Republicans have sent in more is is a presumption on both sides that again we need to weigh in about another week since the majority of people is you know in the primary but it on the table latched end and they did in the early voting\nYeah I think it's hard to tell I mean I I you know I we always hear this blue wave that's supposedly going to happen in in state and even federal elections\nUm and I don't think you're going to really see that until election day I mean what do we have right now about a one point two million people who voted by mail about you know a little more than that you know coming in for early votes but uh you know there's no way to decide right now All right I think I think people have already chosen who they won't\nLet me go to Casey Casey good morning you're on WB obey how are you this morning\nThere and go just two quick things the voting thing if you're a citizen you can you can put the stipulations on there you have to be a property owner 'cause pretty much you're saying you have to earn this much in order to be able to vote correct can't do that uh when it comes to the minimum wage\nIndoors box because that's going to the Fifteen dollar minimum wage trunk skilled workers are going to take that closer to those who do have skills that get close to that they're going to watch their ways\nAnd it's just getting your weight on up the chain and the end result everything that's going to be tenfold more expensive\nCasey quick question do you eat and then I think the Democrats to gain some ground politically on the minimum wage if they sat back and said well we're going to exempt smaller companies because the quote big ones can afford it they don't even do that Casey\nFive understand that and it's it's a difficult a tightrope walk there the small businesses can't afford it or burn you also have to take a look at restaurants which give the dollars whatever their tips\nYou know they're they're just too many perfectly subjects with this but there's no one answered is\nCasey great point you got to the point before I get back to the calls Kevin is this whole minimum wage at Fifteen bucks an hour this is really have any ground again on or is it to push for more of a compromise that maybe ten to twelve bucks an hour and a couple of years which they advocated John Morgan to put on the twenty twenty ballot here\nI I think that's going to be possible look I I Do think the minimum wage will go up in the years to come but here's the thing right now is getting up to Fifteen dollars legislature would not bite on that\nUh enough give 'em wins will say there's no way we'll give you the Florida House race I'm going to remain Republican control I Do think though you're right that the twenty twenty amendment is going to be kind of where it is and look it is an issue you know maybe they don't want Fifteen what can we live with ten that's going to be a conversation for another day I think that's conversation going to be a big one or twenty twenty\nKeith good morning you're on WB obey\nWarning and I would like to know if either one of the candidates would support having an aircraft carrier beaten robbed to make\nThat is a great question go go hold on teeth don't go anywhere go ahead Kevin\n... that is a huge question it really is you know we have pushed in the delegation for over and over again since the Saratoga left since the Kennedy left\nA you know there's been tried to ready for ...
