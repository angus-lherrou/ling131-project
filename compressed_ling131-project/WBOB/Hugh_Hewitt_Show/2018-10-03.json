Roger Anderson some of the biggest national news and we're going to get to it and we are all over the map today the FBI investigation set to wrap up this week quarters is all leading up to Kevin court from Fox News\nWell it's clear the FBI inquiry continues what's less clear is just how far reaching it will go\nDemocratic Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding to be reading from the findings before a final confirmation voters taking things for the team tells Fox News that they've reached out to the FBI number of times and yet to be contacted by the agency although we're also told by senior a law enforcement officials is entirely possible\nThey'll simply rely on for the testimony on Capitol Hill which as you know was\nUnder oath here's here's an interesting question the FBI does it need to investigate Christie in Florida I don't see why they wouldn't be a problem of investigative just to kind of\nStay away from the accusation that this is all being manhandled by the White House but you heard the other clip with the findings that possibly should come out this week that the Democrats want a hold of it before there is any type of like that's really going to sway a lot of them but the question is the Democrats now looking for more time that question came up\nWith Fox News at night Shannon brain with our along with orange the spokesperson Kelly Mac it any more now but gems that originally sponsored and wanted to have just a one week delay are now looking for more time\nDefinitely think something's got to let me read something here from Connecticut and he says I remain very concerned that we might not get the prompt a thorough investigation that the theory if allegations wind up offending people deserve he was part of the one making a deal with an airplane for this when we survey and now hearing it sounds like\nA that's not going to get in Africa that predictable and point I was getting a crash they would call for the investigation any quote is higher than just one week what's the problem with one week well now nothing it cut in half because nothing will ever satisfy Democrats to land the I'm In the terms about the ... twenty twenty that's the sad truth and doing so they are ...\nOkay when when they keep talking about but a ... where we had it had to Chris Coons just one more time\nAmerican heat that are very concerned that we might not get the prompt a thorough investigation\nA prompt but thorough investigation I'm confused they wanted eight Fifteen twenty three now more what is a prompt and thorough investigation\nI think it's probably one that has killed that makes it look like Brett Kavanaugh student several the courts that's the only thing that makes sense that's really what they want to be do\nComing from the story today the New York times\nThat of course which some would say is preparing to smear another organization party of the logistics of water may not happen Thirty years ago member of the blockbuster times reporter legend that Brett Kavanaugh might have thrown ice that someone in a bar back in the Nineteen eighties listen to this montage now known as ice skate\nDocuments that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way qualify for somebody to the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd why we need and let's see Asian because there are a lot of allegations for really are about how he behaves Lenny is\nThat you're a Democrat Senator from Hawaii Mazie Hirono\nAt least documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face through ice in someone's face\nUsed to unload throwing I use capital of throwing ice on how many through ice on you Tim of throwing ice on him for quote some unknown reason yeah\nBy of you know somebody through a vanilla ICD I mean one time I don't know the ice where are we going with all this ... you know I Know Kevin all third accuser Julie sweat and that was being interviewed by NBC she might have been sweating to it because\nWell it was like you you ever heard of the argument well your mom and dad East Bay because in second sisters her first cousin of her best friend Twenty years ago were guilt by association who you listen to this about her accusation about cap and all I mean we're just going\nGetting food Brett Kavanaugh Spicer were punished by I saw him getting rent fellow cops to quite a few girls during that time frame\nOr not we don't know if the cuts were empty we don't know if there were filled with Brett Kavanaugh was they're giving out red solo cups the girls at a party\nI saw him around the punch\nBowls are the cocaine or as I don't know why he did\nBut what I saw I don't know what he did but I saw them or but but that this female he's credible and she'd be taken serious to derail the Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh\nI saw him by yes we know what I'm going to wondering if one of those [noise]\nI can not specifically say he was one of the ones who assaulted will\nBut before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw that cat around there\nI mean he was actually getting the gate ... so that must make him guilty some would say what is the cabinet effect\nGoing to have on the midterms coming up Frank Luntz well Noone poster poster points out that with thirty five days until the midterms the generic ballot lead from the Democrats has been cut from plus twelve last month two plus seven but the Democrats are still leading with the daily briefing Dana Perino breaks a down\nPayment sort of like what would be the October surprise\nBut I think the accent the cabin on it for Republicans they can ban it in certain places for example in the states like North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp now down tend to her Republican challenger that's really big and can be hard for her to come back on the house of misery in the end\nAre Republican challenger that's really big and can be hard for her to come back on the house of Missouri Indiana and West Virginia but it could help Democrats and house seat announces on ... and it might help that where races are really tight and Senate races like New Jersey I'm In Florida maybe Nevada\nAnd Arizona though I think from that perspective we doubt now that are I think three democratic sets of parties that are going to I I think ... account they cannot black around here and they're not happy about it\nThe first ones would be all of them are in states where the polling shows that Republicans strongly support the president they strongly support judge Kavanaugh and one of the number one reason they went to the twenty sixth paying for the Supreme Court\nPolice seen this before denying our land I did not\nSexual relations with at the scene and the thing is\nCategorically unequivocally deny the allegations against me or for America is watching it reaches a lifetime the highest court angry matter\nWe cannot have any doubt so this is so now we're going to get due process this is what it boils down to\nWonder whether or not that slanderous you know the things they're associating him with that have no basis in and really real fact because prior to him back to it it really self this character in a reputation\nAs you know the latest poll numbers that have come out if you haven't heard of them will now today you have\nWith what's taking place where the gubernatorial race here in Florida Mason Dixon the guy that runs that brand coke or as a friend of mine I Know Brad Brad's a ledge and\nUh when it comes to polling out there that the race or Florida governor and we haven't even had a debate yet he he's pretty much time but we're going to break these numbers down for you the Mason Dixon poll even find it independence\nOr even divided between the Republican Ron dissenters visiting the Santa Ana Democrat Andrew Gillum this all follows on the heel they couldn't pay act poll that came out what about a week almost two weeks ago that showed to Santa's up by nine points well guess what the Mason Dixon poll shows give him up by one with the margin of error three and a half\nPercent the Mason Dixon poll finds that ... is leading among men by Fifteen percentage points Gillum leading by women by fourteen percentage points\nDisastrous was bidding Gail I'm fifty four to thirty five among white voters deal um oh you ready for this big shocker among those in the black community eighty nine to four percent identity\nBy black owners will say that I had as fake news right there ... or early or\nHispanic voters fifty to thirty seven Gillum leads to sentence leads among voters fifty in up well Gillum leads among those Fifteen hundred now this is what I found really interesting about these polls year after\nThat when the poll was done they broke it up by regions in Florida just sent this leads Gillum north Florida by twenty two points are low someone as north Florida Democrats in the Orlando central Florida area which is heavily heavily in many cases Democrat\nHe leans Gillum by for southwest Florida by Thirteen were to give them do well southeast Florida which is Miami Dade Broward in West palm Guillen leads by twenty seven\nAnd was neck and neck with his aunt just in Tampa Bay if and listen folks we don't spend these numbers I Know many of you listen to show have said where is disadvantages but yet Tampa which is not very ... that's kind of on so many cases Democrat and ready to Florida in Gillum\nIs is either losing by one or two or within the margin of error I got news for you Palmer on dissenters I look at this pogo and you know what forget that I may be losing among something that but overall ... some of the areas were Gillum should be doing much stronger I'm actually doing quite\nBetter than the real positive for understand is that I'm trying to figure out what it is maybe people are finally doing their homework and they're getting past the inspirational you know nature of his campaign and how will avoid articulate speaker here so they were looking at where he stands on the policies in the right be having a second thought\nHillary Clinton come out of the woodwork she was asked about Trump the Kavanaugh hearings [noise]\nHe has a a racist he's down sexist sees down Islamophobia he has done a anti ... to have a view of America that is incredibly constructive\nHe talks to that and there are talks to them all the time and it's by no means in the ... now [noise] um but it is a very hard core who\nResponding to him and supporting him for a variety of reasons\nWay way way was that last year or just ... that was just recently I was actually a couple of days back she said that well I heard tone hasn't changed she is going to be campaigning with Andrew Gillum for governor here coming up in the next few weeks but great got felt from the five from Fox News says if you really want to look at Hillary solo record\nMaybe she is what she calls Trump voters maybe she's the real deplorable [noise] yeah I looked\nAt her attack a race or sex is anti gay and I think she might be projecting\nYeah I looked at her attack a rapist sexist anti gay and I think she might be projecting\nEyes Hillary racist was he refused to travel on the same playing with Michelle Obama that's probably racist or sexist smear all the all of her husband's a legit victims that was worse than any man could do I would say that was sexist\nOr anti gay I think Trump was for gay marriage ... well before she decided to be for gay marriage Islamic ... well then she blamed thank God the movie which conflated all Muslims with terrorist activity 'cause they were just regular Muslims who just happened to get upset\nSo if you think about Hillary is racist ... she's Islamic republic and she's anti gay she's at deplorable person\nI mean you know there were some interesting arguments you do know that the DOMA the defense of Marriage Act was heavily promoted by the Clintons back in Nineteen Ninety six back even Bill Clinton ran as a Christian radio\nHa ha you remember that yeah very very well and also remember back in two thousand eight one of the reasons why Hillary ... lost all of her blacks report which you would do basically gave over the rock Obama because she started criticizing Martin Luther king junior\nReally amazing what\nShe stepping off he ever did was make a speech was Lyndon Johnson the white guy shoot and see the white guy but wow ... ... implication that really made a difference for black people thinking that that would end up getting her more black votes and then the causing them to lose them all to Brooke Obama here's\nA question what is the final one of the final goals of Democrats when it comes to presidential elections it's almost a trick question Roger Dana Perino who you one more time Fox News the five really\nAnswers the question that anytime she talks we end up doing about it because I can tell the Democrats have a new leader until they go through their painful primary that they'll go through and\nI also think that this has heard leading up to a new name that she is going to continue to push and that is to abolish the electoral college to say things like we know that this is not the majority of America\nWe know this and they're all ain't talking to those people those people who live there and this fight about the electoral college that is coming in our lifetime in the next ten to Fifteen Years and one is going to be the most\nFascinating and that\nMattered I I'm I Am really interested in it and you pick up on it all along the way they're going to I think\nDana Perino knocks out of the ballpark and this is one of the major goals is to get rid of the electoral college right they they think it's unconstitutional the reason why they got up and I think is right and the next ten to Fifteen Years I think there's going to be heavily debate\nIt yeah it I Believe it is as well and um it it's really going to cause you know the the battleground states places like Florida and Ohio and Virginia not to be as important than the national ...\nWe're looking for a job over the holidays do some big money being paid out we'll talk about this coming up next right here on TALK radio

or not President Trump but Hillary Clinton one of the two should be elected the president now will come up as a big issue in the elections in two thousand and eight teams from the daily briefing of Brett Kavanaugh here's Dana Perino\nFavorite sort of like what would be to her surprise\nBut I think that actually the cabin is at ... for Republicans they could benefit in certain places for example in the states like North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp now down tend to her Republican challenger that's really big and can be hard for her to come back on our house in Missouri Indiana and West Virginia\nBut it could help Democrats and house seats announces on ... and it might help that weren't races are really tight and Senate races like New Jersey I'm In Florida maybe Nevada\nAnd Arizona so I think from that perspective we don't know there are I think three democratic sets of\nParties that are going to I I think I'll call it the cabinet black around here and they're not happy about it the first one would be all of them are in states where the polling shows that Republicans strongly support the president they strongly support judge Kavanaugh and one of the number one reason they went to vote in

a law enforcement officials is entirely possible\nThey'll simply rely on for its testimony on Capitol Hill which as you know was under oath\nDid you hear that Chuck Schumer wants the final report before they go to a vote I don't think I really have a problem with that but then again the question is how much political hay they'll make about and number two of the question that we're asking the audience today for those of you listening does the FBI need to investigate\nDr Christie for your German court said well I mean they may just go by her testimony she was under oath then I Would think Roger just to save face I Would I'd have the FBI talk\nTo when you're a few questions that would hurt but they did have earlier you know with this chair for hours before the U.S Senate and the world on television and they probably figure they have all the information from other they need but again face saving it may be important\nQuestions you ask her how much do you have to drink you know did you work for the CIA which parents worked for the CIA man really [laughter]\nSo but as we just talked about Chuck Schumer says well it's not enough time to rush this through I mean you didn't rush

have thrown nicer to someone\nAnd the Nineteen eighties when you hear this clip from the media asking the Democrats won anything about his eyes throwing it's been taken playoff\nGame is that show that Brett Kavanaugh true ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college to feel that that is in any way qualify for somebody to the Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye let's say Asian because there\nAre a lot of allegations for its really are about how he behaves Lenny is\nLeast documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face through ice in someone's face used\nTo them about throwing I use capital of throwing ice on how many through ice on you Tim of throwing ice on him for quote some unknown reason no\n... ice skate their Rogers is now a main part of the investigation is amazing\nThat the FBI is being asked to investigate a college food fight it's it's it's laughable\nBut really what happened he couldn't copy Animal House or John Belushi I mean what's going on here how many ... heard of the third accuser Julie sweat neck she was interviewed as President Trump's it could even get cover from NBC of her accusations listen to this nonsense\nFood Brett Kavanaugh\nYou know Spicer or punish all her life so I I saw him ... solo cups to quite a few girls\nOh I didn't see him spike in part by some given cops I mean heck do Walmart employee could be implicated because the Walmart employee the cashier probably gave them to read drops rights she at why didn't why not individual implicated as well maybe they went to school with\nBrett capital maybe they even were part of the year book a Brett Kavanaugh during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nI won't say malls or the punch containers I don't know why he didn't but I saw him by you know what I'm going to ask wondering if one of those [noise]\nI cannot specifically say he was one of the ones who assaulted new\nBut before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there well okay I\nMean Roger he was in the same state ... he's got to be guilty in the same vicinity and okay wait there are other people there why wasn't Brett Kavanaugh okay maybe we're not being sympathetic to Julie sweating it out that\nHe does a ... I don't think there was the same level playing field when it comes to again if a woman has is with the young boy\nFrom the school is not looked upon as harsh one of the\nMale teacher or a female as harsh as\nHarsh as well so by the way I understand but it was Jim instant wins that I'm a big ... fan and I don't think he's a good role model I'm consistent here ... I mean what about the crabs that he sold out of what public's\nWin Dixie how did he has been in that so I'm just you know I ... I mean\nWhat the woman thing you may have an interesting point but he said she said but Winston still to me is not a good role model and I am a huge huge FSU fan and by the way they're horrible this year nobody's perfect sense right well let's go to Allen Allen good morning you're on WB it'll be\nMore to from a clear day hey what's going on this one [noise]\nAlready finished is counting on stuff when they on the FBI finds out that he wasn't you know it used Claire ... al ... and ... Democrats for the rest of the nation\nYeah\nAsia's shut up there but you know what I always found not guilty you ... you need to resign [noise]\nYou know Alan you know you bring an interesting point looking a cabin all he'll probably and I use this in quotations take the high road and not want to buy the ball but you know what how can you blame him according to what you've said how ... how can you not not blame him for wanting to spike the ball\nYou know and there's also other stuff that he's going to rule on issues go right or right or his belief shares screw you guys you say I'm going to do there as well you know what I wanted to do it\nNow right now due to talk to this morning\nI hear you know I\nI Know man I mean I mean this is not a one sided issue when you attack have an army now they're\nAttacking us ten year old daughter about praying for Dr Ford I mean I'm sure the daughter is going to be called to testify to when she told the truth put her under the subpoena they don't give her a lie detector tests and\nTripled to talk triple do a two by by by the way you know the left out there now saying that if Kavanaugh is confirmed that they went anytime a case comes up in front of the Supreme Court they plan to ask for his refusal\nHave you guys heard that one yet [noise] triple to talk\nTripled to eight to five five James good morning or on WB it'll be what's going on\n... what's going on guys have a first come out like to make that just briefly on NAFTA and then I'll Kavanaugh but\nI Love the way my president is it ... he's basically starting to tweak reform laughter tamper people don't know what that is very important for the economy North American free trade agreement I knew that he was going to attack that problem because\nObviously we voted for him because he always says that American workers come first\nAnd a exports and the state of Florida is a is a huge part of the economy so uh I like the way he's kind of doing that under the radar they put they had like a few seconds flat on that on on the news and the ten minutes for the rest of it was on break up and All right so um\nWow I I I'm just I'm just glad he's just he's starting to turn that around the same way he's doing what the terrorists you know that are on the on the other countries are trying to even out the playing field but on Kavanaugh let me tell ya\nI underestimated Brett Kavanaugh I thought that he was more geeky right and evidently evidently he played football basketball the guy's tough okay he's a he's he's he acts as you might look like a gate but don't you know plans for its builds character built Seymour I'm\nBut I tell you the thing with him is with Kavanaugh is a asking you know like you said asking him to recuse himself\nYeah I'm I'm telling you James Dan is what's being talked about right now they're going to ask him to recuse himself if he becomes confirmed this week that he chases coming from the Supreme Court by what James said something interesting before we get back to the calls\nNAFTA as a reporter covering NAFTA years ago I was a print reporter and editor I\nJust look at the store nap and I think was that great of a deal now everybody wants to blame Clinton hey could and could have not gotten it passed without the Republicans Republicans adored NAFTA mhm free trade\nBut when you have any trade agreement that increases the size of government in decreases you don't have free trade you have what we call managed trade okay there's very little free trade and you know we covered you know Florida used to produce you know we had met Caldwell last week or who looks like it's going to be a next agriculture measure\nForty years ago it used to produce fifty plus percent of O. J. mhm do squeeze the juice now I'm Talking about or you know that they were talking about oj orange juice to the rest of the rest of the country now it's like less than fifty percent because of Mexico and things like I mean it's I mean we have to get I mean we have\nI mean it's kind of like saying we have to pay for the rest of the world but not the world has to pay for all the environmental stuff we had more regulations dealing with us\nAnd then we actually put on the other countries down there if you want to be\nElation is dealing with us and then we actually\nPut on the other countries down there if you want to be fair so I I Love the discussion about free trade NAFTA has kind of an interesting discussion let's go with Frank Hey Frank good morning you're on WB Yogi\nHey how ya doing hey what's going on this morning\nWell has anybody heard anything about Dr words ex boyfriend shaking a sheet you or how to a a teacher friend how to do a take a polygraph\nYeah we we I saw that this morning about one of the news clips that that was sent to me that he believes she lied under oath and you know all that kind of stuff\n\nHow she's worried about her money\nYeah and I thought that it'd be kind of strange I think they I heard from that he was going to come before Congress can testify maybe he's being investigated by the FBI okay I just I was just wondering now I I'm Glad you brought that up that was a story I mean even\nThat's interesting Frank but still I think doesn't boil down to her credibility I get that but of course to credibility about what she knew that night\nYeah that was a big top news story that was sent us where he claims she lied in and of course you know how she's not telling the truth and things of that nature so we'll still with Jonathan Jonathan good morning you're on WB obey\nGood morning guys let me tell you I'm Down here in Alachua listening to your show every morning because it's so much better than what we have down here\nTo engage you Jonathan thank you so much for saying that man\nYeah I just wish the I'm On the on line right now but when I get in the car here and there I can get them you know me and I am great which is a godsend thank you I'm specifically calling about Rogers for\nNegative opinion about the president's comments about Ford fry and being very biased a pro all the time pro Trump or\nAt first I was annoyed I mean I Love Roger he's got the greatest voice on the radio and cute [laughter] but I got to call in and argue but then I thought about it and I have to admit I agree with him\nActually I was most annoyed about it I don't know a few days ago after her testimony and Trump said oh is she sounds credible that sounded crazy to me so I have to admit Roger I think you're right\nRoger maybe out that Jonathan I appreciate it hey good to hear from you this morning ... you've got a big audience down in Ocala Alachua Roger may have a point yeah I don't have a problem with\nWhat he said is there literally consistency from last week maybe he was being nice and then after a few days maybe we find out hey there isn't really anything to corroborate what she said so more of your calls coming up next triple to talk triple to eight to five five Roger says the president needs to be more sympathetic to Christine for what do you think your calls next on TALK\nRadio W.

I I must say I agree with you and my love Rogers voice you guys have good radio voices so I agree with him\nOn Rogers got the voice I have to look oh sorry go ahead I\nI'd rather get that straight anyway I disagree with him though that I I think that\nIf she's going to put herself in this position and and whether ... telling the truth or not you know there there is no compassion your your kids and stuff to do something pretty evil and a girl and and that's the way it is and and you put yourself in that arena you're going to get richer and they get\nBut the number one thing that I go to I talked to a lot of my friends who are women and not the first one of them believer\nAnd plus they say that she wouldn't know woman would go into a hearing where it was going to be broadcast all over the world looking like she look all the hair messed up with the glasses in talking to my little girl\nIt just ... nobody's buying it\n... she ... she is not credible\nJeff says nobody's buying it let me let me ask you a question we're going to be conspiratorial and I don't think this was far from a conspiracy for years as a political reporter let me ask this question\nIs it quite plausible or possible that they sat down with her I'm not saying the Democrats coach there but they they are shorter gave her some you know verbal assurance that hey listen\nRepublicans don't want to be part of me to them and they're going to lose the general that general but they're going to lose the um the midterms now finally put those guys on hold Roger I'm going to be here\nBecause I Want to do with the audience thanks so this is what I'm asking a question do you think was possibly Democrats sat back and said they sat with her or is that what they were attorneys will say they thinking of denial plausibility hey when at me with Dr Christine forward we will you met with the attorneys\nAnd listening to staffers instead of the senators might've met who ... who knows let's say within the circle trust their [noise] they sat down with Dr Christine for her attorneys whatever and sat back and said there's no way the Republicans are going to contest is they're going to run Collins mccaskey maybe when Jeff Flake\nOr they don't want to do this it's like even though he's stepping down or the other ones that want to be targeted with this as Well Donald Trump the me too movement out there they will fold as they say ... like a cheap suit\nAnd that they wouldn't want a contest is you've got a home run I Wonder if that was the discussion that took place behind the scenes if you want to play that role and\nWhat do you think anything is possible obviously didn't ask too much of a generic possible rug it can be blew a great skill I'm just saying I'm saying let me play along okay I Will not surprise me if this was what was said\nBehind the scenes with her people might people in the year people Roger you and I don't mean but our people our age ... and I'm just kinda curious I Want to hear from you a triple to talk and we're going to play this conspiracy game I Wonder if it's quite possible Lindsey Graham says hey fine side was out the recommending attorneys out there and not just kind of curious\nIf there was like hey the Republicans are not on a ... not going to want to contest is because the me too movement Trump females they're not going to want to do this they may want to do something else they're going to be embarrassed they're not going to fight this I Wonder if that's probably what was discussed\n... my biggest suspicion is that it probably was it as an attempt to muddy up the Republican Party as much as they could pass quite bonds was well two things one keep tabs on off the court and then try to get a lot of Democrats to the polls during the ... charms\nAnd it'd be Frank with you I think it's having somewhat of an opposite effect because a lot of Republicans are now have you been able to get to the polls to make sure the Republican or Republican you
