B. O. B.\nAnd here are the top stories were bringing new this morning show Democrats are likely to pick up a U.S house but nearly impossible to win back the U.S\nIn a store government of actual trial begins this week\nAnd Senate Democrats campaigning the healthcare is a writer now pushing for health care vote the head of the mid term elections\nTo contact and the summer and one more call to do two\nTo five ... ... email ... view of what\nAre we now three weeks away from tomorrow [laughter] from what the election coming up soon yeah you're right yeah for some of you may be Christmas you know for some of you is maybe um\nWell I don't know what does it down holiday that people don't wanna hang out how I don't know and oh by the way the folks at Halloween is going on right a lot of lot of politicians trick or treat\nThree minutes after the our good morning at dean Roger ... said I promise you you will not hear any other morning show like it anywhere in northeast Florida very fast paced newsworthy we lay out the facts but it is your opinion the cows triple to talk\nNine zero for tripled to eight to five five\nSo let's kick it off again with just a few weeks left before the midterms the question is in Roger you talk about it here every day along with the dean myself yes the question is\nYou know Democrats were up in the polls but will they get the voters to turn out listening to the latest numbers\nThose oddly poll shows that well the CBS tracker poll shows the Dems are likely to pick up the house there's oddly poll shows that it's nearly impossible for the Democrats to pick up the U.S Senate here were the latest numbers by CBS election director Anthony ... into\nA house with the Democrats\nGetting over a two hundred and Eighteen sees that they can take the election were today where we've got two hundred and twenty six seats sit our model that\nNumber has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these around trackers but\nStill very heavily dependent on at least two things for the Democrats and I just I Can't emphasize this enough dependents on turnout among people who don't typically vote in terms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voted for Donald Trump to the Democrats now\nDid you hear what he said one more time\nTo very heavily dependent on at least two things for the Democrats and I just I Can't emphasize enough dependence on turnout among people who don't typically vote in in terms and is dependent on a few meaningful crossover vote\nNot what he is saying they're folks and we played it but he's probably the main one we've really quit black because I think he's probably been the balance on both sides and he says the people that they called on the Democrats' side Roger that or infused devoted addict track record not showing up at the polls that what he's saying\nInteresting you know when one of the things that's all pull over the weekend that showed that even though the Democrats are looking really strong as far as who they support and their numbers begin to lose the as it is actually tired of it is tied if anything maybe the Republicans have a slight edge\nBut Sabato says that the bottom line here that again the enthusiasm shows that the Dems are pumped the Republicans are ... he says the den should one this is how we broke it down this is what should happen if the Dems show\nUp like ... the person you're talking about are people who don't usually vote in mid term elections says why isn't this scenario is actually the time\n... actually they do they do it on what they're telling us on most of them are telling us in the polling put that in the model it goes as high as two hundred and thirty five states so they get a little from that however blessed suppose they don't show up and that's a reasonable assumption because they haven't done this before the sun for sometimes people do over ...\nNow remember what he's polling and they Mitt unlike probably CNN and others saying these are the people that are pumped but when you look at their track record right they have a track record of not showing up at the polls\nScientists turnout for ... right so they don't show up Asian folks who maybe voted on presidential typically vote in the last ... twenty and twenty four teen idol show out then the Democrats don't make it they don't get to a team that they need and the Republicans hold\nSo again what are you saying we play these clips over the last six months from CBS News they're very fair and honest by saying if the if the enthusiasm shows that the gym shoot should show up they could one thirty plus seats out there and ... if they don't show up and he says these are the people that were calling here\nWhen you will get their track record member folks they do have a ... record you can get through the supervisor of elections\nShows you what do you showed up or not doesn't tell you who you voted in favor of rice shows you'd be voted in a primary presidential primary whatever and he says Roger or if these people that normally do not have a track record of showing up show up it's bad news for the Republican\nYou exactly you are a lot of voters out there who can see their politics like they do baseball they don't watch the rich with regular season but you only watch the super bowl and and do your parents would be some people who only vote in the presidential elections not the ...\nRight and so that's pretty much what's been focusing up right now the we we've got a story out on Florida daily dot com this week that says that again when you look at the ... for example supervisor for elections throughout the state\nHave saying that we may see a fifty fifty five maybe some counties the sixty percent increase now\nThere was a ... member folks forget to two thousand and sixty Trump technically it's not on the ballot you know Democrats say he has three and two thousand fourteen there was an Eighteen percent according to the division of elections\nThere was an Eighteen percent voter turnout both parties and the primary\nFour years ago people care in the general election was fifty one percent okay this year it was twenty seven percent we have no clue but some of the supervisor of elections are saying that could be fifty five sixty percent for as if this week Roger\nMember we reported last week that the Democrats were Kevin derby the editor from Florida daily it was on with about a week ago when the male absentee ballots went out\nRepublicans have always done much better as far as you know requests Democrats had requested more by twenty five thousand but the latest numbers as of this week show that the Republicans as far as mailing them back or up about what about uh twenty thousand swim\nTwenty thousand swing state wide which just ignored forget especially when you consider the fact we've had a major storm in the area that people write a chance to send them back there are a lot of people in the Republican side excited about this election\nBe Tony Tony election there is the latest poll that came out CNN was covering says that uh you know if people are somewhat split Roger when it comes to the election Donald Trump was asked by CBS hey man what are you what do you think about the Twenty one thing about by heat\nI was asked by CBS hey man what are you what do you think about the twenty what are they gonna bite he\nWhat do you think your democratic upon it will be Joe Biden says they'll make a decision by January\nMy dream of mine that's a dream look Joe Biden or ran three times he never got more than one percent\nAnd President Obama took him out of the garbage shape and everybody was shot while\nI I'd love to have it be lied and uh\nI ... I think I'd like to have any one of those people that we're talking about you know there's probably a group of seven or eight grade now I'd really like just like to run against anyone from ... never by himself could never do anything\nAccording to the latest numbers out their Roger and this is something that we picked up over the weekend as you know we always try to get pissed off right and again this past week of the shows that a good chunk of voters out there pretty much split\nBut what ... what was it be you said before that that everybody's comes in all the grades are the same\nWhen you have the top tier ... like ... like Harvard Yale Princeton all the students have perfect grades so ... it's all coming up on the uh the recruiting people and the the admissions people\nTo choose criteria but it's very subjective and it's real difficult to pin them down as being discriminatory if everybody's got the same grades what they look at is how can they create the type of culture on the campus that\nThey want to how many people have the same grades if they're all making straight A's and they got everybody is I mean let's say that some are coming in but\nI mean how do you listen to Harvard or any college University of Florida Florida State okay\nThey come into our local community college and say to your point which I think a lot of people would agree okay hey listen ah everybody's really doing well now let's go a little bit beyond two separate ... which is fine right based on merit what you do with the commute mirrored or what you do in the community who can be against that and\nNot not at all but that's that's what they do it I think it's going to be difficult to really pin this down as far as being because they're not suing whether or not to get into you know the typical median university they're suing because they want to go into the ivy league colleges in all the applicants have perfect grades and\nPerfect right but here's the thing on this issue and this is going to go in front of the Supreme Court both political science upset is the question I'm asking\nHow old are you OK we need to have a Latino and does in the black community okay fine if you don't have affirmative action let's exclude just let's exclude white people All right let's you know just excluded or then I mean you'd have to go for every minority what about as they say Asian American having exclude them and that's where the last ...\nThey don't have enough room in the college to accept everybody who applies that's the problem\nOh so they have to discriminate I have to decide who can't come nursing bases should be based on me or I don't think anybody would disagree about it should be I'm just saying oh no no I'm saying I think if you would agree with you based on what you've done immunity by the way jobs will get that as well what I'm asking is that how is it that we're going to go for blacks and Latinos but we're going to exclude other all the minorities\nWill they do have some you know Asians who go there they just feel that you know Asians if you made straight A's we have a perfect S. SAT and ACT scores how come you didn't get in with this other person who\nDid right but let's be honest don't or the people we've reported that may not have the grades high enough that sometimes in many of these cases there are allowed to come in based on skin color\nAh we've seen that I don't believe that's happened to get that but places like Harvard or Yale or the ... they only accept the kids who have perfect score\nOkay but then again so is the perfect scores you're telling me that the only reason why they're allowing certain people in there is based on what they may do in the community and culture that's the case would you have the same percentage of blacks Asians and Hispanics then\nWell ... it's ... it's indexed of the population at that point but you know at that point harbor it you don't have a guy who got to see ... as the average you know applying the first place to get into Harvard but remember three\nDays it was not okay but a lot of colleges this was not based on whether or not you want to talk to your this was based on race base and a race admissions right this way they could have so many of a of a certain group of individuals out their right to attend college didn't matter a lot of cases on the great I'm not saying that harbor I'm Talking to other smaller schools\nRight right I I'm not quite so sure what the smaller schools\nI remember when we were going to one of the top two schools my daughter really really smart girl she was ... you know given letters so please apply to places like Harvard and Yale and uh we went to one of the colleges they said listen we only accept are able to accept ten percent of those who apply to go into school here every\nBody is a genius who applies to go to our school we look at other things beyond that in addition to the great\nShark tank co hosts tell me oh lots of shark attack one of my favorite shows Kevin O'Leary\nSays what group is not being talked about with the economy the economy's on fire he says it a small business but listen to what he says he says small business isn't doing well because the tax for tax reform it's also doing while based on something else\nAnd what isn't merged which is really surprising last twenty four months we're having the best year\nEver in the last decade and and it's not spurred by tax reform necessarily what the the the regulation in the in the state and even his fault in the federal level has has given confidence to these operators\nTo do something they haven't done in ten years to actually take out loans and invest in their businesses and create jobs\nAnd increase sales enhanced margins scale up\nI mean they don't watch\nSales enhanced margins scale up\nI mean they don't watch television they're not worried about the stock market\nAnd yet so that's what he says he's a small business is doing quite well not based on tax\nReforms which he likes the tax reform because he says even in that clip or as you continue to go further he says a lot of the tax\nCut people have an even sell the effect yet but he says a lot of the small business which is not being bragged about he's doing a lot because of the Trump deregulation is even points out a fact and\nThis is the thing that people don't realize we put a giant ball and shackles on the American economy for ten years I'm not blaming any politicians\nBut you should have seen regulations on just small restaurants in towns like Compton in California you couldn't even put it any more space\nYou had to have a huge amount of regulation around the bathroom and how far it was from where the tables were something we never talk about and all of that has been wiped off the map and these operators are now free to operate don't underestimate the power of a small American business when it said free of government regulation\nHere's an interesting question if this had been a Democrat president or a near the present besides Trump the media coverage according to the media Research Center serves a Ninety two percent of course that's where no it's all negative against President Trump and yet rarely or barely we can use the same word do we ever hear the news about the economic success what's taking place\nYou a lot of success I don't believe it's just taxes I don't think it's just deregulation consumer enthusiasm and top of this is really also playing into a big part of that and when people are going out and spending money everybody including me just business owners benefit because of it\nWell yeah but the question is is if you're if you're a Republican running for office now the Democrats believe that of course we need a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage at the economy based on more of a free market aspect from Rick Scott and Donald Trump have not done enough\nDoes this bode well for example to sit back and say the economy's horrible even though the majority of people out there and give Trump and the Republicans credit for the economy how do you explain that coming\nOut I don't think people are as naive as I think some of the politicians would lead them to believe if you got more money in your pocket right now that you had maybe two years ago you know the economy is better\nAs we talked about the New York times that of course they want to put impeachment back on the table for the election and healthcare which are going to get into an ear in a few moments\nI Would say Ninety eight percent not happening unless there is some sort of evidence that got us for that we might not even known for like two or three or ... I think that they think something that is not going to eight okay that doesn't mean that that that there is a political damage they had the gender or are they and ability to actually get on message and stay on it that's all true but I think impeachment as a way out of bounds impeachment\nIts way into bounces Dana Perino from Fox News the five at\nThe way way up and it actually has never waned that's not saying that's going to happen here and for his detractors it's like every night they think that there's going to be some pay off right so like they're winning they're like every night they tune in tonight tonight yeah tonight than I did like in ... I Would say Ninety eight percent not happening up\nYet and Ninety eight percent not happening overall blonde\nAnd I think that ... an attractive to me that overreach and also nothing can unite a party like an impeachment effort\nExactly you want to fire up your opposition you start talking about the peace but I don't either\nYou have it all was the palm poll want their votes to count more as we continue to move along talk radio W.

theoretically the health care in the right they don't want to pay for one office healthcare\nYeah I Would agree with that too I think there's a way to reduce cost to the free market\nNot not necessarily have to look through and said I'm a capitalist but you get here and just to have a a free market\nOkay well then you're going to have a lot of people that just won't be able to afford it then when he can do you also how well the\nThing that is for okay not saying don't come cars have three hundred million people either want to say but it's\nYou know I'm always fascinated by this argument we understand the role of a safety net like Social Security which was called back in the thirties when I started this whole people survivor's benefit old people would be more of a little bit politically incorrect these days later but anyway that's what it was called it was the last\nOf the last ... you've heard of the best the best of the best of the best rights well it was defined as the last the last the last resort\nNow what is pretty much happens we expanded the role now we've got SSI assets DUI we've expanded the role of what welfare has tended to be and yet when Andrew Gillum who grow corn now is not going to want to debate I guess because he has to be to cover Tallahassee understandably so\nAbout what happened but he doesn't want to debate Ron dissenters we'll talk about that coming up here in a few moments more he says we need to have a\nExpansion here in the state of floor but Roger new specifics about okay Medicaid as far as work requirements as well you know this was something that we've talked about that even a lot of Democrats and we've heard calls on the show waste I got my son or daughter\nDue to an illness Kennedy get the coverage it is today now you want to expand the which means they're not going to be able to get any doctor visits or what we need more if they try to expand it we can't even cover it now\nRight and many of the doctors don't need to do you don't even accepted because the government tells them to pay you forty cents on the dollar would you normally charge and on top of that we're going to pay you a year after were built\nBut now the Democrats are revamping the conversation again is health care is a right\nTo care for all that okay we keep going back and forth as education or write or that's not right either okay well I think education the right and our country the wealthiest country in the world we should be able to make sure everyone has health care\nHow do you like that because everybody can afford it and not you but since we're the richest country that everybody should be able to get that here's a question like to ask you is health care it right should it be a right to get a little bit further should education be All right\nHere's an e right technically in Florida among the floor of the constitution that is right okay okay but should it be a federal right or should we leave it to the states hence the word states' rights or I'm going back to slavery Roger I Will be accused of that\nMelissa Harris Perry liberal commentator says that there's a lot more that should be added than just health care and education as far as rights\nAre being economy because if ever tasted a meritocracy people who work hard and sacrifice and save their money and make major contribution should earn a little more and they said they should have more resources the last time we also how however have to have a horse\nUnder which nobody fall below that especially if you're a child you believe that we're not going to accept that you do have the right to health care and education and to decent housing and to quality food at all the time you know\nRoger ... this does sound popular I mean and I I I was just going to give them the benefit of the doubt I Know some of you listening are like really you know like hey man\nI Roger I have the right to be here I mean Japan's a speech thought it right but yet these people actually believe that a lot of these are entities um they need to be um somehow co-opted and she'd be classified as a write\nYour definition of a write in my opinion is always something that you can get on your own you doesn't require anything else with anybody else if you start talking about health care and nutritious meals being a writer who's going to farm it that means that\nI guess she was in a certain sense say that slavery is okay because you're forcing someone else to to provide you that quote\nRight remember Bernie Sanders interview with Brett Baer on Fox News listen to this\nOne of the team ...\nMuch of it don't it with your brother\nMiddle class family without Eighteen trillion supposedly does not include the fact that the middle class family in the middle of the economy would save about five thousand dollars a year on their health care costs cuts fought about Medicare for all program\nI happen to believe and I know not everybody agrees with like I Believe that health care is they write or call people I Believe that there was something wrong when we're spending we're seeing so where did that right come from in your mind thing human\nRights are being so you can I guess what he's saying and Roger if you're in your view of a human being do you think that a given money to somebody or underneath the Ninety five overpass a who looks like they're fit to work they um yeah you should have a right to give the money or excuse me they have a right to take your money\nWell I think you have a right to maybe should have a right to give the money if you want I mean you can that's what I'm saying as far as they have a right to get money from you I don't know if that should be right\nFor me just seem to agree with me I'm at work all these rights I mean how did we insert a right now which is how do we insert in something that is a privilege or a good or benefit yeah that was the right\nYeah I I don't know where I I think they're probably going up the word because it creates you know applause\nThe United States Postal service is in the red again but they think that all they need to do is just Jack up\nYour cost of doing business the biggest hikes instead of

Republican friends I kind of need to ... you know pointed out here\nRemember the history of those\nAre the Republican versus Democrat absentees here in the state of Florida has always been to the advantage of request by the Republicans we talk about a Democrat enthusiasm is there a gap or they pumped according to the numbers are from the supervisor of elections at this year's I say a Roger the secretary state division of elections\nThat has been reversed the Democrats have record requested more by twenty five thousand right more absentee ballots now the Republicans but as over the weekend Ninety two thousand Republicans have mailed in their ballots Seventy two thousand Democrats have mailed and there's all ad that's awesome it shows a twenty thousand spread no\nNo it just shows that they ... quicker\nThan the Democrats exactly okay that's all I'm saying right now and that was his enthusiasm that what you think would lean if you wanted to if you wanted to spend this would probably lean to the Republican right\nRight well the difference I think between be a an all the polling data backs this up the primary election and the general election which is a few weeks away is that people were still kind of trying to make their mind up until the very end at the library but now they say people's minds are pretty much made up already so why not send them back but the Republicans are outpacing the Democrats'\nMinds here's equation whose minds are not made up soft Democrats soft\nDemocrats by the ways means that they don't vote hardcore Democrats on Democrats means they're probably somewhat moderate to conservative soft Republicans little bit more moderate you had the independent ... group probably you think is not made up their mind yet\nI Would probably say the non

B. O. B. so let's get to it\n[noise] wow I ... I just I Love I'm fascinated by this whole debate Tim and so so let me get a jet let me start right here Andrew Gillum I mean the guy is the gift that just keeps on giving more is graduating\nFrom college yeah I Am on the stage as the most progressive candidate running for governor and the only non millionaire non billionaires\nAnd he is the most progressive candidate on the list I Want to get to a Robert Wise or who is an economist lawyer from Florida tax law to go to Florida tax watched that aren't so Robert I Need I Want to act like on the Democrat Kamala Harris asking you cabin all question I just want a yes or no answer here okay so\nGillum and we set this up for the audience out there Andrew Gillum says that we want to raise the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage what he wants to give companies money to support that that's one cost\nHe wants to eat all over the map about Medicare for all Medicaid expansion he wants to expand that without any quote\nI'm the areas of how you want to work at in as far as work requirements are going to cost more money\nHe says we can raise a billion dollars by Jack up the corporate tax rate do fund education by one billion dollars all on top of that paying teachers fifty thousand dollars so here's my first question to you Robert Wise or\nCan you raise a billion dollars by forty percent tax cut on corporate tax income here in the state of Florida\nExcept for I Can't hear you Robert ...\nA simple answer is yes at okay how can you do that with a forty hour hike\nYou you were you raised the right you can't do it with the cuts you\nHow to Ken Ken I'm Sorry with with the rate the rate increase yeah\nCorporate income tax brings in about two billion dollars to cure for Florida actually more than ... billion to raise the rates will bring in another billion dollars\nA there's two parts to that the the biggest one is it's not just corporations to pay the corporate income tax it's just a tax on corporate revenues but\nIt's passed along to employees and the shareholders and who are into rich people who shop at the stores so really it's passed on to everyone so it's not a corporate income tax it's a tax increase and\nAs always good to be with you I appreciate the introduction as a lawyer and an economist but I'm also a taxpayer\nFry it as a taxpayer an increase in the corporate income tax is going to raise my taxes okay but absolutely it's on hold her Robert Robert hold I\nNow he says now he wants to raise the corporate tax rate I don't know wherever else Gillum wants to spend more money but I Need you to fill in the whole year he says that with a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage and he wants to put her and he wants to be able to subsidize businesses for that\nHe wants to have a billion dollars worth of education funding he also wants to have a Medicaid expansion we can do a lot of this by raising again the corporate tax rate what I'm telling you is I've got Democrats\nWhen asked this question they sit back and say well you know they it's not a bad thing the Ninety seven percent of businesses don't pay a corporate tax rate\nSo what you're telling me is as we can find all of these pipe dreams with Andrew Gillum by raising the corporate tax rate but then again if there isn't enough businesses to pay that he has to find the money somewhere else\nWhere I think we do need to unpack those the Medicaid expansion is if there is largely funded by the federal government that would get\nForget lawyer forget economist I'm a taxpayer when Medicaid costs more I'm paying as a taxpayer even though that's federal money but but a a governor Gillum wouldn't necessarily need to find that money within state revenues because Ninety percent of that is paid for by the federal government\nUh as far as the minimum wage increase that will likely cost uh the economy we've seen inflation from that we've seen reduction in real uh purchasing power that's a different one but\nWith pictures salaries that is important issue in Florida or we do have fairly low average teachers' salaries compared to the rest of the country\nAre not as well when you compare us to our southern neighbors but but fairly low nationally and it it is a good thing to want to pay teachers more a cheap ... matter for kids learning ... in the size of the classroom much more so than a lot of other\nTaking a look at ah well the issue of health care\nAs they try to push an agenda by saying well because you know the the number one issue here in Florida is health care outside of the economy but it is healthcare they're trying to push about going after the president saying that the president and the Republicans don't care about us enough\nBecause they don't want to cover certain areas like certain provisions of Obamacare\nAnd of course when it comes to pre existing conditions this came up to a debate with Robert ... former Obama economic advisor and Fox Business news Kennedy because now it goes beyond just devoted Roger now the Democrats are re servicing the conversation of health care as a right\nThat they have a positive for looking nothing what is it on health care health care has a right now that's what it is it's not\nOkay we disagree when that's why people will be able to vote on that I think that that is the simple message yeah\nSure people may think theoretically the health care in the right they don't want to pay for it went out with health care\nYeah I Would agree with that too I think there's a way to reduce costs to Welby free market\nNot not necessarily absolutely not feel that I'm a capitalist but you get here and just to have a a free market yes you can [noise]\nOkay well then you're going to have a lot of people that just won't be able to afford it then when he can do you also have a well why are they going to do a thing that is for okay tell me\nIt's not this thing down company is three hundred million people either\nSo I keep I Want to do the question a triple do talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five years helped carry rights\nShould it be a ride or should it be limited as a writer certain other groups out there and where do you draw the line with the safety net I mean we don't have any work requirements Andrew Gillum zap proposing anything with his Medicaid expansion\nWould have taken at it but it's not Medicare for all life okay we can going back and forth is education or write or that's not right either okay well I think education right and our country the wealthiest country in the world we should be able to make sure everyone has health\nSo here's a question at triple to drop nine zero for triple to eight to five five should education via right it is the right constitutionally here in Florida but it's not the federal constitution number to shoot healthcare ... writes triple to talk triple do eight to five five Jonathan good morning you're on WB you'll be\nGood morning or on the subject to that that CBS tracker poll\nI just want to say for for the optimist out there\nSuch as me such as myself who still believe the big regardless of all of this Democrat Democrat blue wave stuff that you hear believe that the Republicans and retain vote\nBoth the house and Senate I was reading on CBS tracker poll something that they don't they often don't mention\nReading on this CBS tracker poll something that they don't they often don't mention the margin of error is plus or minus fourteen seats and that means that they're still the prospect of Republicans regaining control\nCorrect and add to your point they also talked about that is a reason why we've always gone in play a lot of these guys at CBS ... is that they sit back and say\nThat again they they show it have your your your you know we don't buy into the polls but then again they also show that these people that they're calling their pumped they say they're going to be coming out Roger but they also we also played the clip they said if you look at their track record they have a history of not showing up\nRight and and who knows three weeks away from now but it may be a rainy day and they may not show up after all who knows how it will turn out only we can do is make sure you vote ...\nIs things and middle class family see what that Eighteen trillion supposedly does not include the fact that the middle class family in the middle of the economy would save about five thousand dollars a year on their health care costs thoughts about Medicare for all program\nI happen to believe and I know not everybody agrees with like I Believe that health care is a ripe old cool people believe that there was something wrong when we are certainly were or where did that come from in your mind thing that human beings\nGod that was the be all dirty Bernie Sanders being interviewed by special reports Bret Baer what is what is that\nRight come from a human being so that automatically makes it a right yeah I mean I could sit back and say listen I think we should have a right to discount comic books I should have a right to discounted uh gators or assembles game yeah borders healthcare become a right\nTriple do talk triple do eight to five something inherent not from the constitution now if a state has it has a right then it becomes to stay right\nTo go to David David good morning on WB obey\nThe law and order 'em right we're talking about her design is another name for much\nFor health care but I also believe that we have a right to work hard and purchase health care you know what I'm sure and and um what what their daughters are hurting people\nNow are not knowing the live just refusing to work\nAs food stamps are a lot of people get on my gay all winter so all of it but in this and that way you can see where people have like the pills to work and I have a lead in the back of their children\nAnd extra money to spend the whole and that's the song is all about\nYeah I I I've got to get going here but but here's here's an interesting take on this is that it I Know people that are church going conservative Roger and their family added let's say a family for only one because\nOf one child even though they could get more ...\nAnd they're saying hey we're we're we're trying to work a reruns I Do have a problem but I Know because evidently all the kids\nHave the whole family of four he be on the ... but they say no because of our one that's on we've applied for because we can afford other things that honesty you're working for it I think I don't think people would have a problem with a quote safety net Roger or certain exclusion strikes if he saw people working for it\nOr an attitude that would be their sit back and he was at least they're trying to work to get off of\nWant to hear what you think your calls coming up next on
