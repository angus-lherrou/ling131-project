B. O. B.\nHere over the top stories are bringing you this morning with poll showing that the Florida governor's race a dead heat the first debate will take place this Sunday in Tampa\nPresident Trump says he won't accept the blame if Republicans lose the house in November arguing that he's hoping Republican candidates in the midterms\nAnd some Republicans are saying that it's time for the GOP to get on board with the idea of legalizing marijuana\nContact the dean\nShow on AM six hundred and one on one one one event for calling to to to to to to find my email and then you'll read on\nGood morning three minutes after the hour we got a busy Thursday morning of course Roger all the additives that never busy well sometimes it's never a busy but anyway I stay busy Rogers things really busy I just kind of sit here and try to look at it but we got a lot going on first debate coming up Sunday Roger in Tampa in fact both candidates\nI'm of a Rhonda Santa than Andrew Gillum will be in Jacksonville today\nBut yeah a lot going on of course we're coming down the home stretch of the electorate the first debate that was scheduled for this past Tuesday but because of hurricane Michael a deal he had he had to pull\nOut and bought it and by the way I Do is it whenever I may not agree with Andrew Gillum I give I mean whether it's for political purposes or not um\nDang if you do damned if you don't if he would have gone to the debate not looked at two in the city of Tallahassee where he's the mayor he would have been thrown into the bus so politically and otherwise he did the right thing\nRight right and to be honest and we are looking for to the debate coming up\nWell I Am but I don't know about some other people and\nMore as we continue to move along higher buddy ed dean here along with Roger Anderson\nWe've got a lot of news coverage today after the record debt well it's not a record deficit but the deficit has been the highest now of almost seven hundred and eighty billion dollars high now under President Trump then that over the last five years since ... now the president getting some kind of criticism\nFrom those on the conservative vile is asking his department heads that they need to cut government spending by five percent Fox News' Mike Emanuel without report\nRelieving President Trump's message to his cabinet today was it is time to get a handle on spending\nThat would likely mean finding savings for the fiscal twenty twenty budget proposal which would be sent to Congress early next year\nAnd while the president makes its recommendations every year Congress controls the power of the purse\nAnd lawmakers will do their own spending plan the president's belt tightening demand comes as the treasury reports the budget deficit rose Seventeen percent over the previous year to seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that's the highest is twenty twelve and that has upset fiscal hawks\nToday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters he liked to cut spending too but noted Republicans believed the military and either to be rebuilt with a range of threats around the world\nMcConnell saying today quote my opinion is to spend as little as possible I don't get to make that decision we have to negotiate that with various other interests who have different demands and that's where we ended up doing a two year deal we had to agree to more domestic spending than we would have otherwise engaged in\nAcross the board cuts which the president has proposed are likely to remind many here in Washington of sequenced ration which was part of the budget Control Act in twenty eleven in terms of spending caps going forward McConnell says there'll be negotiating that based on who wins the election that puts even more at stake with the upcoming midterm elections\nNow we can spend all day and it's usually the Republicans want less spending as it is McConnell doesn't have a track record about that to some of my conservative listeners that say the reason why we had a balloon the deficit is because of military spending\nThat's wrong we've had at one point three what one point four trillion dollar spending bill that's not even the size of the budget\nThat a military spending went from five sixty seven hundred two hundred billion dollar increase well what about the other I don't know seven hundred billion that was spent yeah so when I hear some of my conservative listeners sit back and say well we had to do it because of the military I don't disagree that the military planes need to be refurbished we have to build things up\nBut then again when you hear the Democrats right that the Republicans say well we had to do a lot of domestic spending as well\nI mean hello so yeah president President asking agencies that cuts ... percent of their budget [noise]\nI Would like to come back with a a guy\nThe way\nI'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say what can you hear him five\nPercent by only ... percent start baby steps you know one step at a time you know baby steps were talking about cutting government for Thirty years when I go to Danny something is being done and I just want to congratulate the president for waking up every morning and listening to this show because I was a\nLong time you know I can get the fact that you cannot always control what Congress does you've got both sides of the aisles everyone would get their ... and you can't you know fund the troops that lets you\nKnow Roger Roger hold on hold on to it you can't call it pork barrel spending Roger they don't like to call them how they find the constitutionality due to\nWhatever the case may be you can't necessarily control what comes out of Congress but the president can certainly tell US Cabinet members don't spend everything and it has the same that effect\nWith less than just a few weeks before the election the house as the polls now within the generic but also among those close elections and Hillary won that President Trump won in two thousand sixteen\nBut now the odds for the Senate remember a week or so ago it was fifty one forty nine ... now Bret Baer from special report says those numbers of actually increase in the U.S Senate for Republicans to maybe fifty three maybe fifty four seats\nFrom the mid term elections and as we look at the situation for the house\nWe can tell you that Democrats continue to hold the advantage in the generic congressional polling current\nFox News pulling team looking at race to race across the country says election were held today the house would likely slip Democrats now our latest poll just out today shows that Democrats maintain a seven point advantage on that national number\nWhen it comes to enthusiasm Republicans have picked up on the ground in recent weeks\nAmong likely voters democratic enthusiasm as you see here is also jumped as well\nLet's take a look at the races for US Senate and where we are as it stands right now tonight this is the scenario with Republicans and since he won Democrats and forty nine election were held today and all the candidates for US Senate held on even small leads to they have in the average\nYeah in all of the candidates for US Senate held on even small leaves that they have an average of recent polls Republicans tonight with pickup Missouri North Dakota\nEverything else instead of saying no other changes they pick up the next two seats fifty three forty seven\nAnd then he went further and said may could be possibly fifty four now vets is going to be interesting let's go ahead and act like the the the races already done with okay okay well let's say that\nThe house is picked up by the ... who knows but let's say hypothetically it as the Senate picks up more seats\nJust President Trump takes the blame on the credit\nFor the house losing but then the Senate Republicans because well let me play for you to quit the press and they came out this past week and said that if Democrats win back the house he's not to blame in fact he tells Tricia Reagan from Fox Business news that if the Republicans lose it's not his vote it's the voters for not coming out to vote for it primarily his base\nLot out for public health this as an industry that wants to kids and other people with pot and got me candy soda wow unlimited potency of different marijuana products that will be out there\nPot gum you remember if you were kids\nI knew that I have a being being only in my twenties mania Roger um but my older brothers who are in the eighties memories the bubble gum used to put in your mouth it looked like he came like you could put in your mouth that looked like dip\nYeah I remember but it wasn't ... it was like gum and during the ones you follow it your parents didn't like it used to smack you when you had it in front of a church when he showed on the front row and distracted preacher and the preacher like your parents know afterwards right now it's no more text messaging [laughter]\nSo he's saying that now what's what's going on down the road is is you know we're trying to make cigarettes you know Joe Camel and all the movies that cigarette smoking is actually appealing remember they had some of the candies years ago or it looked like it was a cigarette but it's really much more than a candy\nHe said this is what the marriage you wanna call marriage on it that's what it's called in the seventies the marriage all want a crowd and that's what they want to push Cory Gardner\nThe well known Republican senator from Colorado says for Florida and other states it is a jobs creator and she'd be a state's\nRights issue thousands of jobs at risk [noise]\nMillions of dollars in revenue\nAnd certainly the question of constitutional states' rights\nOf this discussion now\nI find this is a fascinating debate because again let's remember for example for for example scale excuse me remember ... the mayor of Miami a former top rank candidate for governor here says it their party is looking towards the goal of of taxing and regulating marijuana in Florida\nRick ... so we chose to do it\nI Believe the state of Florida needs to legalize marijuana we need to regulate it we need to taxes\nOkay so the Republicans have said that maybe we need to go down the road is unstoppable Roger the economic regime revolutions going to be kicked into high gear 'em ... is is is it inevitable is this going to happen here I\nPersonally believe it is and that but of all to be Frank why I said well you know what this is this the trend in in the culture and people want it yeah and younger people especially are getting older they embrace it was just like an older generation may embrace\nOf the uh the elimination of prohibition this is their you know freedom to drink alcohol but in the modern choice I personally don't support it the biggest problem I've got with more than anything else is the problem of second hand smoke\nYou know someone smoking marijuana they can't just keep that to themselves you know if they're out in public but you know the the whole concept with tobacco smoking has always already given us the president precedent that if you're outdoors in the wind's blowing that it's okay to blow your smoke if someone's face I can see that happening with marijuana ...\nHere's the question I'm always fascinated because this debate you and I both been reporters many years here in Florida I'm always been curious because\nEven though even the libertarians right who are against a lot of government but they can't wait for the government get involved in marijuana ever you've always been kind of curious about that but having said that when they talk about taxing it well what do you plan to tax that number two how do you plan to tax it because you've\nGot certain stores or is it going to be a monopoly like medical marijuana is in the state of phone number three how are you going to regulate it out there that's to me the books they haven't even find that when you know Roger they got to a full area how they still want to regulate medical marijuana here in\nThe ... exactly what it would be available at convenience stores eventually or just a space re type places and how close to those schools will eventually we see a gradual right inclusion\nBut you think it's inevitable because based on the culture I mean do you think Republicans will get an member painter\nThat these guys never liked it here but of course I guess when you get paid as lobbyists oh we all of it now paid a lot of money that's right he's in the next ... they said the ... and then in in an economic revolution is the next green economic boom out there and do you believe that Republicans were in the state of poor because they're talking about really moving this fast\nForward and twenty twenty [noise] the reason why many there was like sixty cities I mean there's a pilot he said do not support medical marijuana is number one the reason why they don't want to Spencer is in their backyard is because there's no money for these counties we make it's all going to be a monopoly gives the Tallahassee\nIf the money could be divvied up do you think number one a medical marijuana more cities would advocate it because there's more more brain coming into the coffers and number two if they if it was a\nEven it was reasonable cell and that's and that's open for interpretation to go full blown a tax and regulated I Wonder if more cities here in Florida will go by we\nAlong with it and it probably would but we are talking about the government wanting to be elected officials wanting more money to spend I think when it comes down\nWe would we were talking about the government wanting to be elected officials wanting more money to spend I think when it comes down to the actual taxpaying citizens if they could eliminate some property taxes or some sales taxes with it it may even be embrace more by the public as opposed to just be elected\nA kind of like the excuse is being used a for offshore drilling yeah maybe gambling some of advocated that it can lower your property taxes and everything else get rid of them call some of the issues coming up the next couple of weeks the Hilton from the next revolution on Fox News says\nHere's an issue that ranked in the top four top five that hasn't been discussed a whole lot lately but with a bunch of those ... through Central America up to the United states immigration can be a big issue [noise]\nGenerally speaking live e bay the elections I've what color is that it's much easier to change\nThe agenda that political agenda will pay more to people talking about what's on the front of that in mind when they go and vote that is to change their opinion so that's good news for Republicans their health care really is at the front of people's minds and so they need to work really hard to raise that\nThe relevance of the issues that strong and I always think the economy but that's another I point to which of the immigration\nIt's actually quite far down that list but it's one where the base of the Republican Party strongly agrees with President Trump stands for ... years agenda changes for this caravan coming up through Central America not raised the relevance of an issue that\nCould be good to get out the Republican base\nYou know to me the interesting debate about immigration I think a lot has to do with identity theft also dealt welfare benefits and things like that huge identity theft and among the illegal immigration crowd we covered that a fake ID cards fake state run Medicaid card so take Social Security card out there\nI'm taking the jobs are national security I get all that if you had to pay in one down as a top tier ratio that you think would matter to the voters of all the process of immigration and illegal immigration what would it be you\nKnow what honestly and then the people who might get mad at me for saying this but I think that they are people in America who feel their cultures being threatened\nWe having an invasion coming in is that it's been described by many from Latin America and you walk around the streets the United states of America you're basically in a foreign country with everybody speaking a different language than your own I think that there's actually some bias against people because of the Hispanic culture\nAnd really maybe I'm wrong ... and uh I'd be ... welcome people to correct me if that's not the case\nBut I think that probably use a ... an unspoken political politically correct reasons as a reason why people have a\nPro or or do you think there is a biased because they may not the Republican\nThat is also a big issue I Believe as well but you don't hear and probably because it's not that big of a problem we don't hear a lot of problems with you know people complain the Canadians are coming in\nCuba so yeah I don't like Canadians are not the most conservative crowd Cubans okay yeah but then they'll go to Bali they speak English or at least most of them do you think well yeah but [laughter]\nNot speaking my health care language I can tell you that right now oh man Twitter Twitter pure hypocrisy when

B. O. B. we're taking calls this morning a lot of issues ranging from\nRepublicans telling other Republicans do embrace the idea of full blown legalization of marijuana collars at the six AM our Roger say well from an economic standpoint Republicans could probably benefit from that right and\nThey won't actually probably just you know six seven percent of it everything else was tax will probably be significant sin taxes applied and bring it may be a lot of money\nWill get into all these and other issues as we continue to move all along the party's been ... some would say the Republican Party but that a President Trump many people don't know who's possibly uh right now the leader\nOf the Democratic party but the author the book the great revolt brat Todd says that with the elections coming out it's going to be interesting to see how the president does and the president's support a lot of it could be based on how he was involved with the Brett Kavanaugh situation\nWell the cabinet confirmation is a pretty big deal for the Republican coalition you know we've we doing three the book where we believe that there's a realignment that's taking place in the Republican electoral coalition a slightly different than what it had been in previous years and I've been to this point in the Trump Administration you've had the old traditional Republican part of the ... coalition\nNot quite know the value long term is Trump is I mean you had some voters who like Trump better than they liked Republicans and they didn't say the value and electing a Republican majority\nIn the Kavanaugh's confirmation Republicans saw that it took a someone as tough as Donald Trump to stand by Kevin and get them through that fire and Trump or saw that it took a Republican majority to achieve the president's object 'cause that's pretty important going into the election\nJohn was asking when it comes to the Democrats and Republicans into base in let's say there's a lot of\nYour mind myself I think it's my headsets my that part of stereo just a little bit I'm Roger he was asked okay if if the votes going to determine with independence and remembers we've been reporting for many

affiliation Uri registering to vote for them included as well\nIn the biggest group is non party affiliations out there he breaks it down on which way the non party affiliated independence may go\nOn to Americans in this in this election and for Democrats they pay their hopes on those dance suburbs the\nKinds of Americans in this in this election and for Democrats they pay their hopes on those dance suburbs there were a lot of suburban women independent women are having to have negative news or the president Republicans meanwhile have a great chance in states where there are a rural industrial voters\nAnd you know I think immigration rising is an issue in favor of Republicans if it becomes a bigger issue toward the November elections you know independent tend to side with Republicans on immigration and other security type issues and they side with Democrats on things like health care and education\nNow we know that when you look at the polls education again I don't know why it's never really discuss what we do it on this radio show but then as you look at the numbers the economy healthcare is number one immigration is also within the top five there when you look at some of the statewide polls\nAnd the Fox news polls if this race is based and again it just yeah if it's based on a course getting the voter turnout also based on non party affiliation and independence\nAnd he'd sit back and say well if they like uh uh they they signed with the Republicans on taxes and immigration but they agree with the Democrats on healthcare healthcare is number one issue ... then you would think the independence becomes split or they need a little bit more to the Democrats\nYeah they could and you know it but the polling data is so close to right now we can go either way and I think maybe even those MPA with on party affiliated independents they may even be split\nPresident Trump says that he's not to blame that the Republicans lose the house he says everybody on his base should be pumped up but he says if they don't win he uses the voters are going to have to blame themselves fantasy\n[noise] then it's got to be clear it up we're going to get along I think the economy is going to care a lot of things so when people are really getting the jobs they want but we have a tremendous powerful vase the Republican Party [noise]\nAnd they have to know that going after the midterms is very important it's almost like going out for the twenty twenty elections coming up in the not too distant future as an incredible that will raise cannabis at tremendous [noise] and I really think again this tremendous enthusiasm for the midterms will see look at four O. one case\nSo let's say we have a really bad\nTime in three weeks from now four oh one K. is going to go down tremendously people lose well\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves to land because they'll lose well\nDown do you agree that if the Democrats win the house\nAs the President's Day your ... will go down now is it possible anything's possible yeah\nDo you think they'll take a massive hit here's the other question that we want to ask you President Trump says he's not to blame if they lose the house but according to Brett Baer from special report the ... the Republicans may pick up more seats almost fifty three possibly fifty four seats and the U.S Senate way\nFrom the mid term elections and as we look at the situation for the house\nWe can tell you that Democrats continue to hold the vantage and the generic congressional polling Fox News pulling team looking and race to race across the country says election were held today the house would likely lead\nTo the Democrats now our latest poll just out today shows that Democrats maintain a seven point advantage on that national number\nBut when it comes to enthusiasm Republicans have picked up on the ground in recent weeks\nAmong likely voters democratic enthusiasm as you see here is also jumped as well\nNow he points out again when you look at the polls right now among some of the congressional districts that came close they voted for Hillary and butter for President Trump but very closely allied but guess what area and the Republicans do better than the Democrats\nTake a look at the races for US Senate and where we are as it stands right now tonight on this is the scenario with Republicans at fifty one Democrats have forty nine\nElection were held today and all the candidates for US Senate held on even small leaves that they have an average of recent polls Republicans tonight with pickup Missouri and North Dakota\nEverything else instead of saying no other changes they pick up a net to see fifty three forty seven\nSo there you said the Republicans actually pick up more in the U.S Senate according to Brett Baer here's the question of Trump says he's not to be blamed but they lose the house but yet you to get credit if they win the Senate\nThe president is probably going to take credit any place you can it's just a personality but the fact of the matter is that you know the the pay maybe people want to have a little bit of checked everybody like some of the things he's doing\nI don't ... I don't really see clear water anymore can this be a turnaround\nWell you're absolutely right you all the public is outrage right now that they can no longer fish recreate you know we have closed beaches when we have algal blooms or now a affecting our ability to enjoy our or outdoor activities on the weekend and these issues come back to us\nThat come back to our government's how are we uh\nUh planning for gross or are we doing smart growth always stopping pollutants from going in the environment and the answer is really no so what we've done over the past three or four decades as we have overbuilt Florida with the unsustainable development work looting it to death and as a result\nPlaces to any member looking a southwest Florida the Florida Keys are no longer what they used to be these are the the banner gemstones in state of Florida which attract this year to come move and that is to be around clean water to enjoy and recreate on and we no longer have that as you pointed out\nEnvironmental scientists Dr Peter ... and the students with his only talk I Want to clarify this when we talk about pollution that's included for pesticides that are going off and has a runoff correct as well it's not it's not like we're talking about a man just purposely doing this it just takes place when you want to have more of an expansion it's going to happen\n[noise] true but we need to be very smart about a pollution and the environment or we\nHow do you mean how ... how do you become smart about it\nWell number one you know we have to have good science and we have to put it into policy and let me give you an example in two thousand eight oh we enacted a state law for mitigating fertilizer and its effect on uh the Jason groundwater surface waters the point being that we had to go into an education program number\nOne and tell people that how to properly apply fertilizer because they don't you're not\nSaying you can't do it just properly do it the right way that's correct\nThat's number one but the other side of it is as I point out with waste water you know we have not invested in tour or a wastewater infrastructure in urban areas we have every time we have hurricane ... through a for instance in ... and we had twenty million gallons of sewage dumped into the lagoon\nOh we continue to have sewage dumping breaking lines we are about a half a billion dollars behind and upgrading our wastewater infrastructure on any Republican and we believe this is directly related to\nThe outbreaks of brown tide loss of fisheries and\nLoss of recreation opportunity to your point I have those um in the pesticide business um that pass control and they they they listen to the show and they will email me they will call me up going you know\nEverybody always wants to blame us but he says we told them like what you said he says ... ... if we have people that live on the river whether it's in Jacksonville northeast Florida or down for example beginning a Republican from pollution down the Fort piers whatever [noise] um\nThey say hey as you pointed out Dr braille do it in a very common sense he says these people can only half acre on the river and in the past controlled ... they're dumping a holy acre where the pesticide ... is running in the water one\nOf the things we did with the fertilizer ordinance was we made sure that the commercial applicators ah were properly license and\nTo your point uh you know anybody can go to a box store and buy wheat and feed and over apply it so to your point they're adding to much nitrogen phosphorus and they're adding to much ah you know ... and pesticides stuff that will negatively affect\nPlants and animals in the water when they over apply it so you're correct\nSo if there is a turnaround how do you ... I mean how do you turn it around to make the water much clearer northeast Florida central Florida as well\nOkay first of all we must invest in urban infrastructure uh again we have cities are like uh probably Jacksonville uh you know going through transitions with its utilities they have got to make a a improvements are in the quality of their infrastructure went around and so you have hurricanes dumps too it's not\nTo interrupt you what you're talking about is new sewage pipes and drainage pipes\nFor some reason why which they've been taught out for twenty to Thirty years even Miami talks about the level waters that are rising but yet they also pointed out if you could find it because we've covered it on his radio show they also made one of the reasons why there's water coming into the roads that they haven't had a good enough job of their sewage drainage are draining sewage and things like that as well see that's a big reason why for clean water\nSure up in cities like Miami Dade county's ah like Broward all the way up to the Palm Beach is of since the Nineteen fifties they've had seven sewage out falls literally ... beach dumping about four hundred million gallons of sewage\nAnd how old is too which is I mean the the the drainage pipes or what but still around for thirty forty years\nThey were put in there and I think that season here we are the twenty Eighteen or like a third world country dumping sewage literally one mile of some of the most visited beaches on the planet\nBut yet they're always telling you that you need ... you need to revamp the septic tank\nAs you know government very good about ... brings down to the common person yet they won't take our tax money invest it properly and keep our clean or our coastal waters plane that's a real issue\nYou or a policy guy but I've got to ask you the politics when when you bring this up you've done this before he talked about on TV or research on radio when you made this issue what what is the typical defense by your local county ... county commissioner the reason why they haven't revamped their so they they can't tell me having enough money I'd gotten billions of dollars\nYou can measure the reason why they have it a revamped their so they they can't tell me I haven't had the money they've gotten billions of dollars coming\nUnfortunately they often say we don't have enough ... but again it's how they spend it and I think we're going to see some leadership emerging particularly alone any Republican that's recognizing the the money has been miss invested in misspent and we must make cleaning up the pollution and getting the infrastructure correct if we want to have clean water in the future\nI got about a minute and a half left this has become a political issue governor Rick Scott Iran disadvantages to kill 'em an end to build a bell Nelson race ... is the is the attitude winning that somehow again as you point out with the pollution mixed up with Mother Nature creates a big big atmosphere that problem in the ... the political atmosphere\nBut then again is everybody thinks that this is the government's fault they haven't done enough about this and yet somehow it somehow blame the government here like governor wrecks out like that you haven't done it with the right time and you keep pointing out this is not a man they product\nNot me I just I mean there was a mandate solution may be but it's all based on Mother Nature\nWell let's be clear you know we have not been responsible about the way we develop in the state of Florida and so we have had a series of a ... leadership administrations in this state that have not been responsible enough to dealing with mitigating septic tanks\nA leaky sewer pipes and job we have this is a legacy of the state of Florida where the protection has been taken out of the department of environmental protection we're not protected our coastal waters and it goes well beyond the politics state and local\nPits the regulatory regime in a state that is governed by politics by already the people and we make our local and state elected officials of the response to this uh hopefully they will invest a our tax money and try to widely problems\nEnvironmentalist or environmental scientist Dr Peter out good to have you in the studio today male students again thank you add more as we continue to move along right here on TALK

the not too distant future as an incredible they're already talking about that the tremendous [noise] and I really think again this tremendous enthusiasm for the midterms will see\nLooking for one case so let's say we have a really bad\nTime in three weeks from now four O. one K. is going to go down tremendously people going to lose well\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves to blend\nIf they don't go out and\nThen they have themselves and land\nArea guys as they don't go out and then they have themselves to blame triple to talk nine zero for triple to eight to five five before we get to the calls and\nJust reported by Roger Anderson one of the other big news stories this morning\nHigh ranking or former high ranking Republicans are telling other Republicans especially

Gardner the Republican senator from Colorado\nThousands of jobs at risk\nMillions of dollars in revenue\nAnd certainly the question of constitutional states' rights\nVery much at the core of this discussion [noise]\nNah so there you go triple to talk triple to eight to five by Chris good morning on WB obey\nGood morning guys I've got two things that I don't hear coming out of anyone's mouth that should bring a moment of parts the first thing is if politicians are chopping at the bit and rare and to go with the program\nEveryone should stop white there that should tell you enough that you need to know because they're just seeing dollar signs\nIn second thing which is more pressing is two words unintended consequences\nI I've never done drugs so I don't know but do we want a third of the people on the twenty percent of the people on the road a driving on marijuana\nWhat what does that do to people is that like people on alcohol I don't know the question I'm asking it back to you but to be a lot of unintended consequences that are kind of come out of the wash for this green gold mine that people are gonna realize after the fact that maybe that wasn't such a great idea but no one's thinking about it\nWhat about that for the here's my question for you ... ... is it a valid argument some would say well you talk about what whatever percentage as you may bring up about the issue of marijuana they could say well\nIs it quite equal to say that with the issue of Merrill or about the whole people being on the red with it\nWell\nI Know that obviously you know the police are on top of it it's very easy to see someone who's on on a who's a driving under the influence of alcohol [noise]\nAh and I think they actively work to catch people like that um I I don't know what people look like who are driving under the influence of marijuana\nAnd let's take a step further so we talked about people you guys talked about earlier people working there on a factory was heavy machinery and they're doing drugs um\n[noise] what's that going to do is that going to raise people's a business this year instead they might have people who are on on that sort of thing and and working equipment\nNow that that's what I gotta get run it that's a great question I think businesses will be exempted from that okay because again I don't know how far the laws may go but how do you tax it and how to regulate it Richard good morning you're on WB obey\nYeah I just wanted to say that I'm In Washington state where a a recreational marijuana is legal and um the people that I spoke to about a subject\nDid not want to go to the dispensaries they went to their regular pot dealer because it was less expensive so it's just the money grab for the government\nAnd I I ... you know what role do you make a ... ... it is a money grab I mean it's a monopoly even with the medical marijuana here in Florida when you've got John Banner telling other Republicans get on board because it's a economic\n... it's a green economic boom it's a gold rush that you may have some say that they you know this was an economic benefit for Republicans and Democrats and for the state of Florida ... ... yeah\nAnd we're not even thinking about the gateway potential of introducing kids to marijuana that young age when they get older they want\nAn heck I don't want to introduce adults to marijuana

I Want I Want to get to the economic boom question is there a Bible excuse to sit back and say it could be an economic boom for taxpayers here in Florida\nTo an extent absolutely meat in Colorado there using some of that money for you know or their state budget in some purposes now there's been some argument that the money that's been going to schools isn't as much as was advertised but\nYeah you can take something that was legal and tax it and you know beef up your coffers then why not um you know it's not like there's a bunch of zombies running around the grill or I don't know\nWell what has always left out of that conversation is the related costs for the societal impact of the legalization scheme if you look at Colorado they don't say\nUm it's a tighter race than I think he anticipated given the money he's raised but yeah there's a lot of situations like what we're facing in Florida\nThe Gillum debate with Ron just than just takes place this Sunday is the issue of economics I mean the Santa some have said he's going to have to come out instead of calling them to point of Obama a socialist the most pro Israel\nOr you know we did a story for the daily dot com on the two economic proposals by that Andrew Gillum and then that of course it rather than just even if you want it to Jack up the corporate taxes\nYou still don't have enough money\nFor education teachers minimum wage Medicaid expansion and yet nobody from the right is running in the ads about that instead of running FBI investigation\nYeah I mean to say it is his whole campaign right now is built on smearing Andrew Gillum now he's been you know to say this has been you know in a couple of times for not giving specifics on his ... right right so hopefully in Tampa if you're a Republican you will hear some of those policy think that's the right way to go\nI think what matters right now is unwinding the voting issues and the nine counties that were hit by hurricane Michael I'm I think that is going to have a greater impact on the results of this election than anything that happens in the debate Sunday\nAnd interesting and yet uh some of the supervisor of elections says that they're going to have special polling places they are going out of the ways that people can vote that's good more people who vote the better area more and more Democrat or Republican it's\nThe most uh consistently Republican the area of the state\nUm especially from a margin basis but why and I've I've read the articles about the the mega sites and all that but here's the real issue there are people that have yet to be found yeah there are people that have de camp to North Carolina New Orleans and all that they can't come home because they don't\nHave a well do I know how those numbers not huge that can't be found I think it's within a hundred and I don't think that's going to swing of Florida last show when you're\nDealing with statewide races that typically have a margin of about two points either way it's significant and you're like the fact that Andrew Gillum is the first African American candidate for governor from a major party he is going to have a significantly increased turnouts a\nAmongst younger folks and amongst African Americans and you add all that together and it makes it a very thinly sliced\nMatching the spin if it's all based on the panhandle lower amount of turn out to vote\nThat if let's say just stance is wins oh blame Trump for global warming does a connoisseur hurricane they didn't get enough people do get to you know displaced would've ... who did the Republicans blame now they blame themselves for not you know supporting and putting them I guess I don't I'm not going to be an exaggeration candidate who had the policy answers\nI Know yeah but no one was anticipating now Gillum no that's not at all no one is built to campaign in the primary to run against\nThere are Gillum no that's not at all no one is built to campaign in the primary to run against Andrew Gillum tripled to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five David good morning Ron W.

T. plant out there okay the question I keep asking is that is is Roger says you know I think Roger brings up a good point it's inevitable based on the culture\nThat we're going down the pike here here in Florida the question is when Republicans were asking other Republicans would jump on board because it could be an economic boom where is that's why I keep asking what is making a move quicker here with this whole argument\nI'm getting medical now you they want to advocate here in twenty twenty put it on the ballot in Florida is it because it's a cultural thing is it more driven by economics or what David I think it's a combination of both in what I Will say is nationally you've seen more states legalize it recreationally a majority of states have some for medical marijuana law in the books\nAnd it's expanding it's getting even more I mean voters are asking for it they're signing petitions they are getting on the ballot now\nDoes it happen here in Florida and twenty twenty not likely Burt what's the whole point if it's a federal law they have it I mean are they lobbied to get rid of a lot of debt unless you get rid of the law was one of allowing made about medical marijuana legalization of marijuana in a state well I think they're going to be teaching this issue\nIn about Twenty years at the Kennedy School because it's a it's a wonderful I'm a experimenting federalism that we haven't seen in very long time but consider this um let's see if we do get the ...\nAnd we haven't seen in very long time but consider this um let's say we do get the rescheduled a rescheduling of marijuana down to say a two or three by the stroke of a pin\nAll these state schemes to legalize recreational could go away and I think that's a likely outcome for this\nWell we're going to see what happens in Canada um Canada will be a sort of a nice experiment for the rest of yeah but ... why do we want to compare myself to Canada they always want a pair of their health care I what I'm saying in reality though they've just legalize recreational marijuana on a national level I think we're going to see just the bad you know the good the bad and the ugly up there and the next year\nForty five minutes after the our talk radio ...\nThat'd be five south St Augustine wrote we're looking at a wreck right now starting to clear up but several cars were involved ... before commonwealth a broken down cars causing delays\nUm ... the president of under woods and I'm proud to say that under woods is the longest standing member of the American Jim society in the state of Florida that's important because the American jumps on Saturday promotes professionalism inside the business and most important because of how it protects the customer\nGemstones or like most things and you have to have the knowledge about 'em before you can tell the truth about um\nThat's where the American jumps on Saturday bits in there the organization is sort of ... and Justin registered ... and ... sales associates rational tied to ensure that who stay up to date to the gym a logical advances we re winner titles about passing the written test every year\nAnd now I'm proud to say under which has the largest credential American Jim society stay up east of the Mississippi River so if\nYou're interested in diamonds and jewelry and won't real professional help stop by under woods in saying Marco Avondale or the shops upon of a drug\nIt's time to start planning your two thousand and Eighteen Christmas Party and the Salem center is the perfect location we have an auditorium back can be decorated beautifully and we can post your get together for a U.S twenty people or as many as four hundred\nPlus the Salem center has that wow factor you will want for your holiday party may sit down lunch or dinner yes we can do that hey mix and mingle event yeah we can do that to an auditorium style Christmas program of course you can do what\nIt also with a memorable style at a price point that it's very reasonable to give us a call now we have space available but we are filling up very quickly\nThe number eight six one zero four four zero that's eight six one zero zero\nFor hospitality directors Angie or Beverly Hall now eight six one zero zero again that age six point zero zero for energy or Beverly age six one zero four four zero that one zero four four zero\nSeacoast sports present Spanish broadcast of the Jacksonville Jaguars all season long don't miss any of the games of the jaguars twenty eighth the season on WB obese one oh one point one FM\nIn six hundred a listen to the broadcast the Jacksonville Jaguars and send you this Sunday listening as the jaguars take on their rivals the Houston Texans surprised starting at twelve forty five\nThe I don't miss all the action for us you buy he goes forward with the voices of hobby I cut it off and Victor course\nForty percent chance of rain today at a high of eighty one received any more rain and a low of Seventy four right now which Seventy five here at W.
