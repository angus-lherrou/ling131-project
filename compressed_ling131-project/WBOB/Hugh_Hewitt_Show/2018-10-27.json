yeah he's good guy Goodfellow loves to play ball\nYeah it's um [noise] I Am a surface in years and years and it's just so crazy I'm\nOn my I just had horses and it's a it's fun especially some of those um\nWould Sue Ellen was talking about in our little book about high impact versus low impact and the ones that have a a real high angle going down to the water like down there surf so I'd just north of belong to a beach is a really there's a lot of shell\nOr you can get a ... you can get the mole crabs out of their ... and uh that's that's that's a good beach I hear nothing but good report so that\nYeah it's where I've uh I've always used to go down there and being as this or fish or you know not really sure fish in ... park always did in the uh you know in the bay area and that it needs to serve fish out and home surf part of it is that yeah\nI didn't either until I met him and\nAsked the beach in their\n... but ... everywhere man you know whenever I'm used to live on ... because I mean that's you know something you could do for two three hours and then go home and not have another hour and a half worth of work or on the clean up and all that [laughter] you know uh\nIf you get on a Google Earth it always shows the water at low tide uh-huh and if you get in there and look at that bay area and we are talking about yeah\nYou can see where the channels run ... ... when the tide starts dropping all those fish set up there on the sand bars I've got nowhere to go but back on around those channels and there's all place over there on the far side so little hike from those polls\nTo carry all your gear down there but\nIt narrows the the little channel on channel ... and ... you can set their own at low tide at the drop off and just\nGets just about anything you want if you feel the shrimp\nYeah I have tried it not peeling the ... and you don't catch nowhere near as many but if you take that shrimp and peel it throw it like where the scent can get out there you know they ... it just about any fish goes through their pick it up and get away who are right there\nThat's the good thing about shrimp but everything is shrimp so you know when you're when you're out there like that I mean if you throw in like men managed and you know you only got particular fish just going to eat this Mad Men is but\nI'm using that shrimp everything eat shrimp I've been wanting to get back out to visit ... JDs because you know they have this water temperature is dropping and um you know I saw the other day I mean it's it's probably in a week and a half has dropped six or seven degrees\nYeah so I was down below eighty now\nAnd you know tied you can see where I'm at fishing been tailing in there there's a lot of snails\nIn there and ... and there's a lot of ah lately there's been a a grass has grown up along the bank and there's a lot of fiddler crabs up in that crash now where I didn't used to be any is there any grass at all along that\nI Know there was no ... no grass open there in the eighties\nThough and you can go in there as when we went out there and not toss the net um you can see big potholes yeah where are they the fish and been in their tail in there so it's um there's some fish in there\nI used to like get in there on the higher tide you know come in through for Georgian and fish for trout they're on the higher tide and they should be a news time of the year ... I haven't been up there to see\nThere's enough baked for everybody and their fish people\nWell and I think actually only a lot of bay one saw a bunch of this ... leaves at I think you're going to see the by pick up the\nKnow for for all the species like the the founders trout redfish they'll get ... [laughter] yeah because I mean right now there's so much better for them but they yeah and now the one thing I haven't seen is district coming down the river Leno\nAnd um you know we tried\nAgain for the ... I Can't remember I think it was a blast Monday and they're just they're still just so small just wild and so I don't know if they're even going to get any size to him or not this year\nThe brown and see where they're getting their shrimp from the local news somehow I don't mean Mm\nYeah the brown and see where they're getting their shrimp from the local news somehow I don't mean to some of those people were talking about some shrimp the way down south\n'cause ... Saturday ... is that where you got some\n... you know where they got the shrimp primarily over grounds yeah yeah they were I mean uh I Know you get home from browse but I'm Wondering where the shrimp and they ask yeah 'cause those are really nice being around shrimp in\nYeah and and have a nice sized ones like that you know a lot of times when we're winding fishing or ... of course we're breaking and a half or ... break him in three pieces because all you want small piece fish for wedding I mean they get small mouth you know um\nBut yeah they've had some really nice ... shrimp and um I've been enjoying a days but you know as far as getting those but um\nYou know I don't use a lot of dead shrimp and less as Kroger wedding season and stuff like that and you know but um but yeah it's yeah of course that drum now also syndrome rather trout river I let you shrimp but there because for some reason there's drum there like shrimp instead of uh instead of crap\nYeah ... something something big that mud must have been a ... over there we uh we hit the ... south\nOf the full ... oh did you yeah somebody marketed yeah way more heat it down to um yeah there's two drops\nOut there and we found them both they've got nasty gnarly old movies on them at home but he is somebody dropped it and I was like well you know we keyed in the numbers and went right to it um oh well we must be in there I Believe there was a buoy\nAnd he's not a ... it's yeah and they know this\nUh it's crab trip style float but it has been hit by boats as\nOne of them's was only half of the editing to watch that off editor yeah Mm is that it could have cut in half the half moon flu [laughter]\n[noise] but Joe y'all fish that has been very good but we did a un official pages huh usually fish last shrimp\nI Know what we did was a bottom fish was some flounder rigs and I I was about a bottom fishing of ...\nAnd I tried a must spend our bait and they're just kind of probing the area to get an idea and uh it was hanging up on stuff uh I don't know is\nIt the structures sinking into the silt or not but it wasn't too bad we're able to get it I think we get everything back except for the he got he got ... Wang or by adding big\nIsn't hammered ... about pulled a poll out of my hand it was totally unexpected Wyoming went down and I tried to fall back on it and set it and it was\nSaying was that ... with an attitude or\nWhile it stand in line so I did yeah yeah\nYeah down there yeah I mean there's no doubt I could have been a bull red or something like that team had like tackle it was near the end yeah Sam avid Adler Danny inflict fishes sometime you know laugh shrimp over top of that we have the best way you can locate like the\nThe surface you know to see how much water you get it and just kind of drift ... pretty you know ... pretty close to it shallow I mean it should be ... I mean I I ... and blank drum and proud of them\nYou know I got a ten foot a stainless steel chain on my anchor and or I could see the the chain\nTo rope ... on the the rope where the rope couples up to the chain was coming right up to the surface of my anchor was on the bottom\nTo the anchor anchors about you know twenty inches twenty twenty five inches long mhm and then ten foot a chain so it's it's shallow in there so I Will never ... bad\nYeah we're on the left fish and the last of the ... going in there which is usually ...\nList for the room to less of that going to be that that was about as low as it don't get in there yeah normally I mean on an average ... probably yeah do we have had that real managed touch but still um that's good to know that you can go over top of that thing without hitting in a you know I have\nTo worry about that unless you're getting a vote and got off course got way out of the ... is way out of the ... it's hundreds of yards from the channel\nAnd we were in the tide was said it was one point one at low you know there was it was a in between or we just had a thumbnail moon up there or something\nLike that yeah yeah and it wasn't a minus at all so as you can point one I mean that's a foot above normal so you know\nThen then you wind depending on what you wind up doing\nMargot good on the on the scope and see how big the low yeah you could yeah there's plenty of of structure and it could be\nTwo hundred two hundred feet [noise]\nYeah well if you can catch the salinity back that way and more you got a little salt [noise]\nProbably would do pretty good yeah\nThink things will far off as we can have the water normalized again\nYeah I think that the that might have a lot new was down there but um you know because it's got to have plenty of barnacles oysters algae on it now so you know and we really haven't had much rain at all no Nettie we hadn't lately\nGet it but I Do get Thursday night and fry a\nAnd na na na no movement on six and that ... no I didn't even\nThere that um but\nYeah I say you a copy of the side\nOK out at ... ... yeah whatever anyways I forwarded it to you\nYou take to what is it\nOkay yeah 'cause ah okay I ain't got it when did you do that\nJust a little while ago but a a redo it cause I sent it to one year old pictures\nThey need to leave the pier alone because uh it had a piece of the ... of the\n... lodge floating dark from somebody else's dark wedged up underneath of it but you pull that out of there and the and that peer was good to go and that was one of the finest peers obscene\nYeah it was cold out those recorded over all the way to the grass and headed over there and you know he's a fix platform\nOh God [laughter]\nAnd that is FEMA huh\nYeah\nI didn't know they were in a closed in ... to ... the jurisdiction does he need like the\nYeah only if a hurricane damage to intercept another but yeah I'm going to be interested to see that so I could make some phone calls\nIt's yeah the famous because what I tell\nYou what there's hundreds of people that use that here you go through it and\nSay my number six nine nine two to eight five is that the one you ...\nThat we see [noise] the females that are all over the where they are they doing with our period when I was gonna\nSay yeah I get a pet her okay I just didn't mean when you're ready but yeah it\nKnocked me down what I thought because as far as a lot of the older guys can't get out the vote before there\nWas that was a nice peer it's awesome you know I mean I have two big cheese on it\nYeah I haven't been on it but but I fished around it you know not to lures around that time I mean in certain times of year people go out to the end of it and catch black drum of a\nSudden you know some goes the kitchen bull ribs off of the ... around very are you gonna put him to go\nYeah I was talking to the guy's a couple of weeks ago they were tearing up the big reds there you go should I say the big rats were tearing them up yeah [laughter]\nYeah that's that's ... times yeah I mean that though I always\nFelt that appears just a great a great Pyrenees for people to be able to finish

there's been blowing like crazy but um when you plan on getting back out there\nI'm going to try to go Wednesday morning\nOh yeah I think Wednesday supposed to be a lot nicer a you know I think um they're looking at the end of the few minutes yeah either that or south Williams five not just show in here\nThat such nice because I Know it was they was dice once I got to get out of the wind yeah it was nice but I further more what is it a creek if I could stop feeling when and I couldn't catch where I wanted to and I just said no I\nGot my future out and to the house\nWell whenever you get out there just try to you know get those areas that um you know that you can uh that you can get to try to learn as areas because I tell you what\nAnd it's there's nothing like getting up and learn a new areas I mean I always loved that that back I mean that's\nI don't know the fish the new area unless that try to go back through to ... to a garden creek from Chad again but I'm not sure this would do it at low tide um you know my Carolina skiff course it only took about eight inches of water so I so I went all through there but I'm\nI'm not sure this would do that I think I Need about Thirteen inches or so and this but\nHey Robert this ... ... uh\nI was going to add a little too that a while a long time ago I read an article in the magazine that was called the shallow water angler\nWhich they don't have any more and it's called the ... that was called a fish and the tides creeks fish and the ...\nWell if you fish that income and\nYou can they'll fish will follow that income and tired of all the way up into those areas where there is no water ... and then and then if you turn around and finish it back out as it goes back out of that than they follow the water back out is it that Todd water starts to empty out those shallow waters\nAnd that way you won't ever get to be afraid about getting stuck in there OK\nYeah a lot of the smaller creeks like that I don't go in to them on the ... going to\nGo in a moment in ... yeah and that way if you if you hit bottom or something like that and you know five or ten minutes you're floating again and you can see all those ... to the yeah now we let them do it at at the lower tad you know like when you first get in there when you can barely get in there because those fish need less water than what we all do\nThey'll get up in there and I mean I've seen fish for their back out of the water three hundred feet ahead of me where I Can't reach them you know but\nThat kind of breaks yard but still you know sooner or later you can can I get up to ... the\nCreeks are going to end it as the sooner or later you can get up to that area you know\nAnd with your new you can get in there really skinny\nYeah oh yeah yeah I'm I'm

um\nI listen to your show quite a bit I haven't heard this question my niece has gotten into it timeshare she can't afford from all the reading I can glean best option is to attempt to bring it back and failing that\nShe had the option of a judicial\nForeclosure and they had not she will not be liable for\nUm [noise] what is the word charge or a demotion\nYeah they will accept his back you could do you can't beat it back to them without their permission\nRight and they will so they're already saying they won't but interestingly enough it's would appear to be being charged with credit card which seems so they barely really they couldn't qualify for real um they do it appears what they did is they opened a credit card and what they're doing is they place the monthly payment on a credit\nCard so it seems to me it's simply a matter of um once you stop Devon from occurring at that point\n... ... ... you're nice open the credit cards that's how it appears that we don't do well she can counsel to come home she can cancel the card [noise]\nWell yeah and that but we don't default on that card although it is non secured that\nThat's not what you're trying to get Chris tablets credit so you're better off if you can get them to stop the automatic debit from occurring then pay it off [noise] then then you'll have to deal I guess they of course you'll\nBe getting phone calls from a timeshare condo saying hey what happened but at that point well\nYeah but the end result would still be a judgment against or possibly one day\n[noise] yes I agree I I don't know another way for them another option for them they don't they just don't have the money they have shoulder and they do they need to get out of this seems to me [noise]\nI'm In the absence of them agreeing to accept it back in ... in a to eat it back it they're going to force her hand it seems to me the best option do you agree that good do you think I'm doing well or do you\nDo is there anyone she could give it to that would accept it [noise]\nYou know it's it's it's one of the things is\nThe every other year or two week every other year it's way more than they can or they're already underwater they're living in a trailer and um\nYou know [noise] [noise] yeah and you know a lot of companies a lot of these companies advertised that they can get you out of a time share it with a ... not good\nYeah you have to pay pay them and then I you know some some of these ... at least some of these you don't get your they never get you out of it and you just made them money to do basically nothing\nGot thrown out to do that yeah I like\nThrow out there is anybody in the audience who's ever hired one of these timeshare companies to get them out of a timeshare\nLike to throw out there is anybody in the audience who's ever hired one of these timeshare companies to get them out of a time share and more successful I'd love to hear hear about that and they could probably helpful but a lot of other people so we'll give them a free\nCommercial if they like to tell their story about how they got out of a timeshare [noise] so yeah\nBut do you think I'm On the right track there do you what you do you think there's another way to go about it that would be better\n[noise] yeah I Would I Would counsel a credit card and then if she can't pay otherwise she can't pay and she can get the credit card paid off in stop future payments than they have the option of foreclosure and once you get\nIn the foreclosure Modi might be able to they might be willing to accept a deed in lieu of folk closure instead of paying the legal expenses associated with that hit which\nI Would expect because it was like this entire non judicial foreclosure was really created to benefit the timeshare industry because of foreclosure is lengthy and expense and expensive this way it allows them to receive the property back put it back in ... at this time though they just don't seem unwilling to do it I mean they're looking at gift horse in the mouth and of\nCourse while they're still being paid every month and being able to charge a credit card so get rid of the credit card\nOkay but I thought you really they wouldn't even allow you to cancel the credit card it seems like we need to get them to stop the recurring\nWell you know if you're a nice open the credit cards ... any time of course\nEven with money on it and recurring debit occurring\n[noise] cancel it for a future for future payments\nOkay well that's good to know that she would have to suspend any future habits and then agreed to pay the existing and then either leave it open for the purpose of no private overcast what\nI think you can um I think you can stop future payments stop the money for a future payments and then maybe just working on paying it off and then they come out of you and then you can negotiate the a deed in lieu of foreclosure\nThank you so much you know that's all we were rising arbitrator we [noise] you know if you need your printer fixed and they got a call attorney that's what you do\n[noise] All right Robert or Scott I think you bring All right let's go to Robert ...\nYes good morning Joe morning\nA thank you for helping or all of us out here are you do you really do good work I appreciate you very much\n\n[noise] um I don't question the carnival like I said honey I doubt light\nAround south shore [noise] at least they\nKnow if you have a contractual written lease and they're not really in violation of it I think judges for the most part if you take 'em to court and try to make them for some reason and in some marginal reason the judge who would normally side in favor of the tenets\n\nSo you have to have a pretty major major reason they most of the time to a ... ... ... you get the best way to do is just talk to them and ask them if they could have possibly leave early that\nYou want to move back in maybe give them a little break on the rent or something if they would leave early\nSorry I Do hope that helps [noise] All right\nLet's go to a probably should have asked what was the minor thing they violated on the lease to get a better understanding of that but uh let's go to Tom in Sarasota\nHello Hey Tom yes I got a question about ah my mother in law died a couple of weeks ago and she left a channel five thousand dollar insurance policies that well\nAnd I was wondering what is the procedure to [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nWell I have a better fishery or the policy was the estate [noise]\n\nWell that's unfortunate because most times the person that owns a life insurance policy will name a beneficiary and it shouldn't really be their state because that just wars is it through probate\nSo you've got to five\nThousand dollar policies without a beneficiary so you'd have to win without a well you'd have to hire an attorney to uh start the probate proceeding\nSo without a so the mother in law did so was she married [noise]\n[noise]\nOh he passed for okay and how many children did she have\nGreat\nSo typically what has to happen is the three of them are the two of them have to agree upon who would be appointed to personal representative of the state\n[noise] um\nAnd in the personal representative of the state\n[noise] a guy has it's less than Seventy five thousand you might possibly be ... be able to do what's called a summary administration [noise] so is there\nA separate administration's the short form of a probation or any creditors floating around out there\nNow [noise] so it was no creditors uh you probably could do what's called us some reason the destruction probate\n\nSo your your wife is one of the children right\nThat's correct\nSo which she want to be a somebody has to honcho this thing to hire someone to get\nThe proceeding started\nShipping and wanting to do that yeah okay\nWell are you all have an attorney she needs to be evidence they play news attorney she needs to contact that and she has any questions and doesn't have an attorney I'd be glad to answer any questions she might have\nOh I appreciate it like All right thank you\nDon lines are open you know the legal question it's called the radio show today you have a we're about halfway to the show you the toll free\nNumber eight seven seven nine four three nine six seven three and let's go to Stacy in Clearwater\nThey Stacey say that I I wanted to go to my car I'm quite quite certain I my husband and I purchased the property\nBack in August when it comes to like a current and when he purchased car ran down in the previous owner and see how that either rental property we um we get extended originally that the previous owner had like the\n... and early ... they would no longer than good camera thirty first\nUm my question\nNow defining 'cause they're they're building a house and that's what you know why they're staying there right now\nMy question is if they are not ready or able to live out by December thirty first what legal rights dry half to get them out of there with ... with at least saying that it ends December thirty first\nWell you would to communicate with him in ... you're not going to extend the lease if that's what you're not going to do and that night a week you would like to for them to know that ahead of time so they can make arrangements to leave by men and see what kind of response you get if they if they say\nThey're not very cooperative [laughter] they're not very easy for people to deal with and I'm Wondering if I have to force you\nRun into them of course\nOkay how ... in Florida because I knew to Florida and a lot here still employed at um they're like a certain amount of time that I have to fight I mean that really didn't want to have to go to the corner to fair you know there's certain way that I mean if they're like a candidate thirty you\nKnow when I was in them a certified letter\n\nYou know as soon as you can bet you are not going to extend the lease past December thirty first okay\nIn their ... yeah I Would I Would give them a would give them notice even though you might not have to give them those but you know if you want to make it perfectly clear they need to leave by December thirty first put you in a better position if they try to stay\nI got a chance I write thank you for answering my question All right thank you\nAll right let's go to Michael in a ... and\nMarty how are you I'm doing great and you have\nA question of living living trust them and stuff but we have one child [noise] if\nWe were both my wife that we both of 'em are like our house\nWhich you know it's not going to pay for that will be [noise] and then we have three cars there is nothing on [noise] we have to put those into the trust in order for them and my daughter to be able to avoid going to be with that [noise]\nWell automobiles don't necessarily go through probate put your home\nAutomobiles kind of an exception is usually fairly easy to work with for the personal representative of the will to deal with that without going through appropriate process your home your home so it's a it's a regular home and son a mobile home it's a single family home was we have a date\nYet or if I were doing your trust for you I Would have put that into the trust to win the trust is created with what's called the quickly indeed\nAnd there are special language and that has to be in the trust and the deed to preserve the homestead protection\n[noise] so that's not something we can do now\nYes it is yeah the trust is like a bucket the way I like to describe the trust is like a bucket you have the rest of your life to put things in or take things out so quickly indeed can still be done to you trust\nOkay and then our bank accounts and we added her name to all of our bank accounts [noise] so what was going to need to be in a trust it only really\nWell in our in our by adding a name her name to your account\nShe's the co owner and if she were to get to divorce have an accident\nThen her credit or situation could affect your own ship so okay I think that would probably advise against that and put the asset in the trust the bank account and the trust in that way can also be use your benefit if you become incapacitated before death\nAnd you're not subject to your child liability\nChoke you put the ... the ... they have to take her name off and be accounted for we spoke to trust you\nKnow you have to take her name off which is what you should do anyway\n[noise] okay All right well thank you for their nation\nAlready been eating you know the further help but be glad to hear the answer more questions for you or I think you should [noise] excuse me let's go to Dan in Jacksonville\nCan you hear me Joe I can okay or a non family member verbally\n... told me four or five years ago that I listed as a beneficiary in their trust stand or will I'm not one hundred percent sure what the guy how can I find out is sending you know they pass away before I Do that I Am and dean listed as a beneficiary and assuming they have the trust\nWith absolute certainty because there is an obligation on their part financially that they're trying to cover by putting me on there\nAnd was to me as a beneficiary a pass a financial obligation that they held on and so I'm just wondering how ... how do I or anybody for that matter you find out if they're listed as a matter of Fisher I Want somebody passes away\nIf they can agree on things like that then they need in\nEach attorney we should have an attorney that would work that out the easiest least costly mad that of course is to have an agreement between two of them if they can come to that about who gets what and how much and so forth\nIf they can agree then it goes before the court the court basically decides\nOh yeah that's the short term marriage of under seven years\nSo the longer you're married of course the more it becomes a like over Seventeen years is pretty much a fifty fifty right\nDivision but on the three or four year marriage is kind of unknown and the court was going to see the financial affidavits they both sign and make some decisions that they can't do it themselves\nIs there any equity in the home\nUh yeah yeah I'm probably about at this point depending on what it felt for\nProbably thirty or forty thousand dollars\nAnd that's after real estate commissions and all of that\nYeah yeah that's what it should be any way that that's going on from low estimate of property value on home that I never\nWell I shouldn't say around and try to work it out so who do or even if would\nYou be okay with like twenty five percent of the equity\nUm he really just wants to get away from her she cheated on him and so forth and I guess somebody pulled him in Florida I Know in Ohio you can't really get somebody it's just you know you're a what are irreconcilable differences or whatever\nBut you know there was no longer if you have a it's a no fault stay sickly so they have no children yeah\nNo no children\nWell would would she be agreeable if he just signed a deed over to her\nAnd not ask for anything well here comes the trick then he would like to purchased a house\nI see because he's now at school and\nYou know well I don't know how important I don't think the court would grant that so he probably either she agrees that and he agrees to take over the mortgage\nIf they agree to that that might work\nBut if she wants something piece of the equity and then they get that has to be negotiating she'd probably wind up with part of that in any way\nRight right yeah that's what we're trying to figure out so the house with ... with the mortgage company actually be able to transfer the name\nYeah your son was ... when the mortgage yeah your son would apply for the the mortgage\nAnd they can be worked out where she's released if they accept him\n... wouldn't be like going back in and paying them by the house actually you know with all the closing cough and all that kinda stuff correct\nNo just be a transfer to from a hurt him with an arrangement where he's approved in the mortgage and she gets released\nOh that's awesome man yeah that's\nCool because of all I'd much rather mortgages shouldn't be a problem but\nYeah yeah he well so I mean ... to me you know\n... yeah [laughter] I Know\nOh anyway well hey appreciate the time man I I didn't even know your show with on this station I turn the station on every morning when I'm at work and then the garage and I heard it and I'm like man to be a good opportunity I appreciated yeah\nWell I like coming up there once in a while I'll get to calls where I have a reason to come up that way so\nI have an office that I was one of the financial planners I work with has given me a if I had more clients that are my little office up there but I'm\nA love to come up there I've spoken at a couple of churches up that way than invited me to come speak so I'm looking for speaking opportunities in inclined seminary so I can get rolling up there so\nYeah cool and I I Know he'll he will or they will need at least one attorney I Know in Ohio you just need one attorney to a a represent both people wouldn't like it at an all night and stuff like\nThat and you know it's always better to have to go one representing each side but at the bar is getting work everything out that certainly makes it easier and if they work everything out in uh the the one attorney you know like she could wave a right to an attorney\nIf for example we were representing the sun\nSo right okay All right All right we'll sound good we may be in touch with you know banks thank you have a good way to you let's go to leave I in Jacksonville\n[noise] I'm On the question why you're talking about a a ... a semi are only get a thousand or ... or whatever\nThey're even responsible for instance you saw\nThe aerosols for a person I Know my sister or brother or a money but last may and my brother and my other brother a lump sum but he likes to show that you know\nTry to tobacco and are not very ... and the same amount but they she printed it out to I think it's two thousand a month mhm and uh and it's pretty clear thousand that backlash from your brain tissue guys are already or something [noise] uh\nShe she got to go through or\nThat they do at work is that possible for her do that if there was that she she ... she said I Want to\nShare how much you can go to Jay Jay ... or something like that you can get the money came\nTo get the money is in charge of the uh well anybody can contest the clause in the Willard trust those can be very difficult\nAnd so JD which she tried to sell her share\nRight right I mean yeah and I wonder how much how much gas take will take\nWell yeah I'm a trustee would ...\nI guess take take like well I'm a\nWhile because Trump the would have to agree to that in trust you probably wouldn't agree to that so she might be done in the water on that\n[laughter]\nIt wouldn't be able to fight it and help right\nWell they they could but it'd be a big battle and she'd be using it probably her share of the money in the trust to pay for it\n[laughter] so okay there\nAre I Know because I thought that you're crazy\nAnd it it made me now\nAll right now I think you\nKnow senior asking attorney all about Florida law we have about seven minutes left in the show you have time to be a caller at eight\nSeven seven nine four three nine six seven three\nPhone lines are open Neal is good at after Shelley they're open let's go to Shelley in St Pete\n...\nI guess chilies not they're not OK\nOkay so you're listening you ask an attorney all about Florida logging we have time for a few to call in at eight\nSeven seven nine four three nine six seven three that's eight seven seven nine four three nine six seven three phone lines are open be more than glad to try to help you if we can and let's go to Mary in Tampa\nThey marry\nYeah oh yeah yeah I appreciate your being on the closure\nYeah I Want to I Want to put my daughter I'm like what they\nAre so this is your home said ha ha\nWell I Would usually advise against that ...\nThe reason why is she going to live there with you\nYeah uh-huh chicken and I'll be [noise] I I Am there\nWhat's your level of uh certainly knew that she will stay there with you\nOh [laughter]\nThan white man and I'm I'm a ... year though though I mean you know I didn't you\nDo you have other children\nI have a child ... our way out to better on line that out and getting a divide it\nWell I think it'd be better for you to be in full control of the house and you are now so why change that just have a will or trust their leaves it equally two the two of them at the other ones from being receiving an inheritance\nOr who have a a ...\nOh yeah well as the properties and the trust and does it probably leave it to the two of them\n... ...\n... you know I Would stick with that if you put your daughter's name on there that's the gift that means it has to come out of the trust and then if it's if the value of the gift is more than Fifteen thousand you have to deal with give tax return\nOh if you die the property gets who stepped up costs basis if you put her name on there then the the ... year costs spaces gets frozen on her half the amount of what it was a time of death he believe it the way it is it gets to step up costs basis\nAnd generally I Can't think of any good reason to win particularly since you have a trust to put her name on it now\nBecause you need to get out of praise and you have to follow a gift tax return if she would ever go out on their own and doesn't live there then you have a person that's um ... owns half the houses not in title to a homestead exemption on it or so\nThere are lots of reasons why I usually try to talk people out of doing that\nYeah well the fishing gear\nDo do do it we just take it or we do a quick claim deed from you to both of you\nKnow\nAnd that puts her name that puts her name as an owner\nYeah what what\nAre we do a deed like that for a two fifty and let's say two fifty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh
