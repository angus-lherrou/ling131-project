summertime one on one minute recall two two two\nTo five ... ... email and you'll be\nGood morning three minutes after the top of the hour I Am a dean your host right here on TALK radio WB also hanging out our good friend Roger Henderson\nBorough what's up hey what borough yeah she's saying hello to be allowed on day was that a little street there are like that a little bit yeah a lot going on do today\nI got a lot going on and I had and were were brave oh we've got a lot it meant a lot to talk about I think there's a lot of news out there but of course the big ones um ... is the economy consumer confidence is all time high again but yet Republicans don't seem to be gardening on that we'll get to that\nThe independent voter everybody keeps talking about the Republicans versus the Democrats everybody's forgetting the non party affiliation will cover that amendment number for restoring voting rights for a restaurant in voting rights for felons and Seventy percent and a lot of those in the white community supported as well so it's not a race issue\nI think if the issue of principle people Philip they've done their time if they haven't committed murder and they're not rape is maybe they got caught with some you know doing something or whatever and they pay their price then everything maybe it will be restored\nAll right I'm Glad everybody's tuned in and let's get to it the latest numbers out there shows that the independent voter Roger coming less than a week away\nFor the November election here in the midterms in Florida he's totally been ignored the Republicans are up as far as boat or response back that doesn't matter that it doesn't mean that vote count but as far as absentee in early ballots that shows that the Democrats might make up the difference may not probably by the end of the week\nAbout three million voters have taken place but that forty two ... about forty percent the Republican told her to the gym as far as returns ... about a half million\nHave been by non party affiliation and everybody keeps assuming that is this Republican versus Democrat and the party Philly it's maybe the wants to decide at all\nAnd you gotta respect but because they're saying you know what I'm not going to automatically vote for you just because you're on my team because I don't know I don't have one or in my vote tell me why I should vote for you and these are the people who are deciding the election this year\nConsumer confidence is a big issue as well as some of the biggest we've seen since the end of the days of Ronald Reagan here with that new CNBC\nHe or she has been in the last twenty five years and they're showing up in numbers even at Britain order\nBecause the transition the on line has not changed it it's still happening they're learning to play the game on line [noise] I'll\nTell you the number of laws and the last couple of the country and they're\nGoing to expect a busy holiday season but the question is are Republicans\nCapitalizing on this type of conversation President Obama was back on the campaign spin again talking because no one else seems to be able to compete with the Trump economy but Obama says hey again I'm the one who needs to who deserves the credit\nWhen I walked in the office ten years ago\nWe were in the middle of the worst economic crisis in my lifetime that was the last time but the other party was in charge of things [noise]\nThink it's interesting I Hope people kind of notice that every time there's a pattern where they kinda they run things into the ground and we have to come back and clean\nWe got the economy growing again we started the longest streak of job creation on Roger\nIt another twenty million people on health insurance\nBy more than ...\nSure the welfare American like me pay their fair\nOn insurance rate was falling as kind of interesting insurance rates were falling off of the deficit which they help bullet big time even that was what books do you ... it did go down after ... for several years and by the way it went back up underneath his last year before Trump\nCame in fact checking some partial truth the economy was in shambles when he took all of course some things around but when Trump took office things got way better than even that I think that's the honest truth\nLarry Kudlow says with all due respect compare ... he's the White House economic sink you see the economic advisor he's on a he was back on TV again this past week saying you really want to compare the two economies\nWhile I don't think he's right with all respect to burn president about and I look at 'em\nAnd they have a skill that show the so called recovery was fight it out to ... percent average per year which is really the worst since the I Believe Simpsons oppression and already\nWe've beaten are critics including a bomb is that people were on an economy that's three to four percent economic growth and the whole change here look\nPresident Trump is cut tax rates on small businesses and corporations and individuals if President Trump is you know roll back onerous regulations\nAnd what you're seeing now is a tremendous increase in ah men and women who own\nAnd then by the way Roger we seen as being capitalized but it was talking out there and it seems that it's not an issue that you think the Republicans would capitalize on pretty big and they don't seem to be\nTalking about I think Rick Scott's talking about how well he would be a more of the economy really you don't think ... what have you seen it thank\nYou so anyway that's my point you you can't find it and that\nIs also saying we want to continue the progress Florida's doing really good let's continue to pat\nHas given any specifics mail service the specifics are right there in front of them\nAre probably not too far with the general sense I think so\nPresident Trump says he wants to do with the stroke of a pin like Obama we want in birthright citizenship with an executive order the latest from that John Roberts from Fox News hundred\nAnd fifty years the fourteenth amendment to the constitution has conferred citizenship to children born on us soil\nWith three migrant caravans setting their sights on the United states southern border ... like to change the fourteenth amendment states all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nBut the White House is zeroing in on the five words subject to the jurisdiction there right\nIt houses zeroing in on the five words subject to the jurisdiction thereof possibly make a case to people who cross the border illegally\nMay not be eligible for constitutional protection well President Trump would like to end up with an executive order leaders from his own yard he said the only way to do it is through a constitutional amendment\nFully the process to amend the constitution requires a two thirds majority vote in the house in the Senate followed by ratification of three quarters of the United states\nHas kind of an interesting question might sound a little redundant conservatives do not like when President Obama in ... did a lot of executive orders why would they go down this path Charlie her from the Washington Times says you know this is going to end up in the courts anyway and absolutely it may be much of a stronger effect if Congress from both sides get as involved\nWell the fact of the matter is a uh unfortunately you do see a lot of African Americans who have had felony convictions probably in greater percentage has\nBeen through and what if what if the crime is higher in the black community is was that because of Jim Crow to no not at all okay is that maybe it's because of of an economic situation maybe because you're whatever city you may live in a local city council hasn't done a good enough job to provide that maybe there is enough ... I mean I don't know what I mean I Do know issue\nIs the breakdown of the family used to be ... like humidity than anywhere else\nSo amendment for has one of the highest areas out there when it comes to the economy Republicans seem to be doing quite well but a lot of people are asking well how come governor Rick Scott has not talking about his economic record Pam Bondi the attorney general said coach give me the ball I think I can score to touch\nI can only pocket one for parents now forty five here\nShe's talking about a U.S Senator Bill Nelson\nAnd political life sons efforts on real ... basically gone now for higher taxes three hundred and ...\nRick Scott I'm a career and his turn our ... around we're in the last ... created millions and shouted hits a lower taxes are ... and because of Rick Scott\nMan there is a woman right there who is positive she's actually\nThat woman probably could've been your next job and she ... she yeah I mean I Wonder if you could probably could've taken on Rick Scott in the U.S out of you know that's a pipe dream I mean I Would have been fine but\nBut ... bodies out there talking about the economy you know Rick Scott came out two thousand ten seven seven seven seven years\nWell we'll have what seven hundred thousand jobs and under Saddam era was all planned but anyway the bottom line is is he done to these double a lot of those numbers when it comes to the butt of many people are saying we don't hear that come from the governor of New Jersey journey general put an apple\nYou're putting Pam Bondi stumped as one of your your positive thing for him because she is probably the most popular political rock star and Florida by the way\nShe didn't just stop what that race she couldn't wait to talk about Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor's race\nIn taking down for the governor's race Clinton hill I like that\nSign ... defenders clash people go online and look at that price anti gun anti law enforcement anti jails anti police for\nYou know by the way I just kind of curious sometimes you bring up the heavyweights when you have to go home sometimes you don't have to bring up the heavyweights evidently look in the poll numbers out there the latest university north Florida poll shows that\nA lot of guilt supporters ... may end up looking like they're going to vote for Rick Scott what does that say while the split their\nBet the event that's actually true in the polling data shows that of Scott's you know a lot closer to Bill Nelson than in the sand is with Andrew Gillum\nAfter the radio show one of our one of it probably the top one of our top big wigs and he said I can quote put them on record Mr ... here no fear who's got a great sense of humor I [laughter] he goes and you can put me on record\nI think and by the way Mr ... it's been this business he knows I mean he's up and down the country he's actually help political office was well yes um and then he says and this and he's a very conservative individual he'd just given analysis and he says\nI think Andrew Gillum will become the governor\nAnd I think Rick Scott will become the U.S and it gives you can put me on record\nOkay when that happened to say he was right\nWhen it comes to that as well when in that issue when it comes to political civility again everybody wants to blame President Trump for the shooting over the weekend up in Pittsburgh and of course for Cesar ... for the male package bombings out their gut felt says you know and listen to this clip\nGoing to get off from the Fox news the five he says when it comes to political stability I don't want to hear any lecturing coming from the left I mean\nIt's very hard to take a lecture some Democrats about civility let's take the long view back okay what's looking decades look at the last two years which have been\nWhat you call it the president Hitler you call them racist said he's clinically insane morally and fit that says two years within two years but who has been stoking anger for decades\nWhose claim that the political is personal meaning that could endanger life I I don't want that system people who pardon the S.

Graham says he wants to address or even one of the state legislatures\nAnd and and and the legislative fix for something like this would be so much stronger in court for\nJust you know the back in the paint hung back and forth there will be a future a Democrat or presidents and all they have to do is go and switching back so I think that a lot I liked the idea of wanting to Congress and forcing Democrats and Republicans in Congress to deal with the issue\nTripled to talk tripled to eight to five five how many all knew why there was the fourteenth amendment Tucker\nBut there is ample reason to believe the law does not apply to illegal immigrants for birth tourists birthright citizenship arises from the fourteenth amendment that was passed just three years after civil war and it was passed to guarantee teen citizenship to free slaves\nNatural none of these are worried a fix our entire lives function going on over forty seven six three fourteen hundred today and get your\nLife back with alpha medical groups called and I know for his seven six three fourteen hundred for a visit our website at alpha medical group dot com\n... fame film director of death of a nation can we save America a second time is coming to Jacksonville Saturday November third to honor Americans lost in the nine eleven twenty twelve Thirteen hour Benghazi attack you can get your tickets by Googling to next to Susan in Jacksonville and follow\nThe link to Benghazi tributes congressman Ted Yoho and prominent national speakers will participate in the American first program following the memorial ceremony at the high end again ...\nIn Jacksonville and follow the link to Benghazi tribute to reserve your tickets now seeding is limited\nMostly sunshine and blue skies today eighty to the high receiving mostly clear sixty four below fifty seven now a W.

wrote a paper about um how we could easily well much easily but a kind of cut through red tape of of getting voting rights back and even gun rights\nFor those who you know want to do that\nThey would have to look board and then the war was the recommendation of the staff you know this yesterday that show they would say that to the parole board because right now it's it's a ridiculous situation where every day to go before the parole board and you know that's why it's so\nThis this would eliminate\nAll the waiting period as far as not so much waiting created them when they come out\nBut once they decide to try to get their voting rights back wants to eligible to do that then they\nGo ahead and go look for in order to make a recommendation yes or no and they could make a recommendation yesterday no\nGun rights at the same that run into some issues with guys who were teenagers and and maybe we're in a fight or something now fifty years later\nThey've gotten the voting rights but they see they would like to have their gun\nRight All right let me ask a question has read that course now the member once this goes into walls of the constitution it there are still legislators that can still kind of rewrite certain things but must apply to the full measure what the Mentalist past Lawrence oh here's a question\nFrom what I've read currently what we have right now is you have to go after a five year process even though it's been struck down by the courts I think\nUm they want you to redo it there is a well you have to pass a you know you got to get you know once you come out of jail you got a show like a probation that you're doing better for the society out there if I'm not mistaken doesn't this amendment automatically get your vote does it go back and give you very much back\nUm you don't have to go to be in a good citizen type thing you don't have to get in trouble with that period\nYeah do you like this amendment would you favor vote against\nOur voting against it really [noise] [noise] yeah oh yeah 'cause I like to see\nSomething that's that's one of the things that I had in there that these local would be a maybe a judge your to a I'm a prosecutor defender hey I'm you know some regular citizens pass\nThrough whatever so they get really look to see what this person starting to change their life I'm not a good point you know they would have to bring other witnesses in when they do um you know for eerie right though I you know I just don't want just blanket just give 'em back\nBy I got I got to run on the underground to Yemen\nHad good to talk to you I mean he brings up a very valid point\nThere are laws that are set in by the by the state legislature but the judge you still have discrepancy to okay time served door I think you know you you you come across as not as bad or like for example if you get up and took the definitely\nThe journey comeback judgments about how I'm gonna give you a life in prison there are certain discrepancy that a judge\nCan deal with but the question is it really hasn't been talked about is that do we automatically should be given automatically felons their voting rights back without going through someone will say we knock it down from five years to one year probation OK ... again not even a compromise on that\nAs I understand the ... the court ruling guy and I could be wrong on this the ... the court said was that the decision as to whether or not these phones will get their voting rights back was based upon\nElected officials and they were concerned the partisan politics may come into play is whether it I had always has partisan brawl everything apart as well and they wanted to remove bad as to whether or not someone could actually get their voting rights back\nOr not you know they didn't want to report let me ask you a question\nWhat was what would have Democrats control the state legislature and they want to do totally eliminate the probation process and just given by the voting rights back right could you not sit back and say well partisan politics come into play right it's at ... happens on both sides exactly\nWould and uh ... the the court said that it shouldn't happen on either side

Democrat is a weak argument is the correct it could be but you gotta ... it's like name calling you got to talk more about the issues ... going to be asked to go get about the FBI muscles unfortunately Donald Trump\nTo Robert Mueller well so what\nI mean it's to me it's based on the issues I don't want any Democrats I said yesterday that are betting against Trump based on FBI yeah debate 'cause he doesn't like them so the ... the question is that are the majority of these guys are looking to get a job\nThey're voting rights I mean they want to become part of society I listen I Need to change\nThe walls bull all have to be changing the constitution\nYou gotta birthright citizenship going on right now we need to change the laws we the laws are just been thrown in there like the general welfare clause X amount that's been used for I don't know for the welfare society is going back to the Nineteen sixties or the right to privacy was inserted a Nineteen Seventy three roe versus Wade\n... el GB T somehow the the founders of the original intent and we're not that original\nSo that's all I'm saying if the question I keep asking is it that if you want to change certain walls were these felonies or the judge enough discrepancies why do we do it by case by case that's what I'm saying\nThere could be an argument that could be made bad you know the expense of having to have representation going to the clemency board or could prevent a lot of people for me for pursuing that track I got a friend he committed a crime involving a gun no one was actually physically injured thank the lord\nHe was tried as an adult I think at the age of sixteen he's now in his forties he's been a youth pastor he's a a husband who was married to one guy who writes back no why he's frustrated but you can't vote and I don't know I Know he was good to go see the clemency process he was pursuing it the less we talked about and I haven't spoken to about it because I find that\nGuy would probably get his voting rights by the end we need to it's kind of come in this country well we need to revamp these laws those laws aren't being addressed that would just do a blanket want to just give everybody the voting rights back its case by case basis and the gentleman used brought up men are you kidding me I think it can be a role model\nOr would you really role model he's he's mentored young people have been involved with mentoring and his church and who's not gone back to the crime had a real ... come to Jesus moment while in jail and it's changed a lot but he can't vote\nNine zero for tripled to eight to five five love to hear what you think about this as well right here on TALK radio W.

will not address this issue because they're afraid if they go down this route like some of the marijuana stuff that they because why they're not looking at serving their full eight years in the house or the state Senate they're looking around for higher office they want to join church become pope the next day ... as one of my Catholic print pointed out which I'm not Catholic\nAnd they they were afraid they run into a Republican primary that'll be used against them that's the reason why they're not going to take a position on the gambling boat which is sad that only take a position on the ...
