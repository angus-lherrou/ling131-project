B. O. B. don't forgive me be that listen to the show when you're smart phones you can download it for free just go to W. B. O. B. dot com W. B. O. B. dot com\nLet's get to it as we continue to move along the federal deficit of course Roger you know with three what less than three weeks now before the November election you help tears on a discussion latest poll numbers on that we'll get to hear in a few moments but the issue of debt and deficit to Republicans\nHammered President Obama talking about how he created all the presidents combined the national\nDebt then from the George Washington to him and a lot of the courses accurate but according to what we see right now the numbers show that the deficit the highest it has been\nIn five years now it's seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars and that's the largest instead of two thousand and twelve and according to the CDO next year you can reach somewhere around eight hundred billion plus here but the latest on that Rick Santelli from CNBC\n[noise] I read that we've talked Twenty one trillion with a team\nRecently on the national debt not a good place to start but yet there's a lot of fruit involved in this story apples and oranges everyone wants to blame the tax reform tax reform is paying for itself revenues are up over one percent\nThe problem is spending four times that amount the problem I have is this president it really pushed tax reform and many believe that's a good thing to jumpstart the economy but the issue is in the route to getting that done he signed a bill that was just\nToo big with respect to how it contributed to that that you're\nFrom the Hoover Institution Edwards here says you know if we don't get this together and we keep talking about this down the road down the road he says we're gonna look like countries like Greece and other groups out there but in the aftermath of this thing goes even out of control which it is now he says we're not going to be able to do this and come back and fix this problem\nBlogger and just for a moment if any of these numbers and you say where are we going to be seen in Twenty years or so\nWe're talking about death rates of upwards of eight to ten percent it can't do that for a very long period of time we've seen other countries try to do we saw grace try to do it to Italy and try to do it\nUh and and then if they act responsibly after the fact they have this enormous debt service to deal with and that puts huge pressure on their budgets and it puts pressure on interest rates and on the ability to invest\nIn getting the CBS says possibly by next year they're ... they're going to rise to nine hundred and eighty one books you know what that means Roger that's almost a trillion dollars right there\nTo a lot of money that the human responsibly spent if it goes a long term plan to get us out of it that they are telling us to use the one I don't know maybe you know some around here I don't know it's just a response but you know what's interesting\nAbout the debt and deficit we talk about Dr Tom Coburn former a senator one of my favorites\nOut of Oklahoma he's with the Manhattan Institute here said this is a set of before in recently just said it again he says when it comes to because we can talk about spending we can talk about tax cuts but it gives you if you need to borrow money when you talk about ... ratio he says we're not even gonna be able to do that well\nYou you're not going to do anything about it because there is not the political will and Washington to actually make those hard choices\nAnd the thing that ought to be scaring people and ... awakening them as the men to cover ratio decline from ten years ago to now and what that says about confidence in us being able to borrow in the future the perjury said they're going to borrow three quarters of a trillion dollars more this year than last year\nAnd most of that's associated with spending\nIncreased so there's no discipline so we have a structural problem and washing doesn't matter which party is in charge what happens is we keep spending money that we don't have on things that we don't necessarily need and the consequences of that in the long run is a bust in terms of our ability to borrow\nA bus when it comes to our ability to borrow and also when it comes to that Lindsey Graham of South Carolina senator says the deficit spending is coming from a title match\nOr we're not in debt because of discretionary spending were dead because Medicare Medicaid and Social Security or just exploding and calls that two thirds of the federal budget is entitlement spending plus interest on the debt\nThat they want to get out of debt less to the entire reform we need somebody to take the role of Ronald Reagan on the Republican side and challenge the Democrats like a Tip O'Neill\nThey adjusted the age of retirement for Social Security in Nineteen eighty three extended ally to Social Security by about forty years\nThe latest from the recovery with hurricane Michael and what has been going on things were moving much quicker Duke power if I'm not mistaken says they're looking to get a lot of the power back on within by the next week week and a half that is very quick coming around here Roger after a big disaster exactly\nThe president was in town recently and a bright he actually praised Scott for his quick response and helping to ...\nThat would have been a real surprise here with the latest on the recovery my job is\nEmphasizing the maximum effort is under way to help victims of hurricane Michael let in first lady came to battered land haven Florida twenty five miles northwest of where the I made landfall Mr Trump phrase rescue and relief\nFlorida's governor has emphasized health at the sunshine state is receiving from the federal government most recently of FEMA program that will put hurricane comes up in a hotel and federal matching funds to rebound and Mexico beach those resources mean manpower still searching for those last since the hurricane anybody home\nFlorida's urban search and rescue task force number two members have been searching all through the existing structures and debris with a preliminary search more detail secondary search they're now transitioning to remote areas searching for those still unaccounted for since the hurricane\nA remote areas searching for those still unaccounted for since the hurricane\nCould avid dog teams are now here in Mexico beach working what what number of the task force calls the more difficult debris piles meantime the police chief here in Mexico beach Anthony Kelly says a number of those are still unaccounted for since the hurricane down dramatically to only three\nThat's my job and from Fox News I knew I Will tell you one of the reasons why they want this done quick and clean up is October November December January February march we are talking five months way spring break\nRight that is going to be a major\nCity all suing and uh all the beaches there\nAnd they want all of this taking care of the ... the question is will the comeback quick enough yeah you know what I'm doing a lot a lot of a lot of groups are going over there was a church on Sunday there's some people Roger eighth week we talked about this with management if they had Internet service over there I Would take the show is over there I mean you for a whole week there's just no Internet service that's so true and I love to help clean up\nTwenty twenty Roger we add we haven't even gotten done with the two thousand Eighteen elections but guess believe it or not she has multitudes of man and female power in states like Florida in other states that matter all lives of this war\nAnd DNA shows she took a DNA test that I guess maybe she isn't really\nIndian Native American but yet the media thanks so worn had DNA analyzed concluded that contain somewhat Native American history but dean misled about your ancestry happenings putting this nonsense to and how much does she have Tucker Carlson from Fox News and the case\nBut one of the test results that she's produced actually say\nWell according to war and she may have had one unnamed and so on and Dennis ... Indian ancestor not necessarily from North America by the way eight or so generations ago potentially\nNow that could make her less than one one thousand American indian that's about roughly as American indian has virtually every white person I've ever met which is to say not American indian at all\nAnd actually Indians are disgusted by it\nThe Cherokee Nation just this afternoon released a statement they called the ... claims inappropriate and wrong quote it makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses well also is honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens in other words it's bad for Indians so we\nWe find out that she is less Native American and you and I mean I mean here's the other one according to some of the stories are Elizabeth Warren's releases a DNA results that she misled employer students and the public\nFor years but the media I mean even though again when you look at the daily mail dot com the numbers show that she has less Native American DNA than the average non Native American but what do you do know that I have DNA\n... one thousands of a thousand twenty four twenty four percent shows that I have a quick thought Superman just want to let you know about that one as well but what is this really go build Jacobson a Cornell law professor says all of the shows is that Elizabeth Warren is the fake\nAnd when she talks about the system being rigged against the average ordinary individual she herself\nUse the system to be rigged in her favor [noise]\nNo it doesn't settle anything at all in fact it raises more questions you can hear you need to understand how deceptive Elizabeth Warren was in claiming Native American heritage Native American ancestry\nShe did not claiming when she was a child she didn't claim it for college she didn't claim it for law school she only claimed it when she was in her late thirties and beginning to climb the law school ladder the law professor ladder from the University of Texas to Harvard\nJacobs it also points out that if she was such much as she claimed to have a Native American how come she didn't get involved with any of the groups are clubs when she was attending school\nThat's the only time she's ever claimed that she never affiliated with Native Americans she never help Native Americans and she was never a faculty advisor for Native Americans she got her self listed as Native Americans so she can be declared a minority law professor and\nShe didn't act when she was climbing the ladder and we know why she did that she can say whatever she wants but everybody understand this is a woman who built her political narrative claiming that other people are ringing the system she tried to recall her career by claiming a status to which is not entitle\nHim by the way for those of you on the left out their stop claiming that this is an attack on India and Native Americans\nIf Roger complaints about the way we have a huge black audience listening to this radio show right when I don't care what part of the ... I'm grateful they call up and disagree that's fine I don't throw them under the bus\nBut just because it is they themselves and Roger there's been times those on the liberal side have agree with you and myself doesn't mean that they're a sellout in Norway jak in those in the black community or in the white community or whatever this is about an individual her or himself that needs to take responsibility for claims they\nMisled or lied about I was almost willing to give US Senator or the benefit of the doubt thinking that maybe the oral history of the family she thought she was Native American science proved otherwise for example I've got an aunt who had a DNA test all her life\nShe thought she was part Native American her mother was actually registered with one of the tribes or DNA came back to zero\nNative American her mother was actually registered with one of the tribes or DNA came back with zero Native American ancestry it was just made up somehow when the family history of the ...\nHave you ever heard of the initials D.

B. O. B.\nLet's get to it we are now less than three weeks away from any member elections again in numbers show from the Washington Examiner other news reports out there the CBS tracker poll shows that Democrats if the people that are being polled show up\nOr because they've not had a track record hints door tracker and they don't show up a pretty much the Republicans keep hold of\nThe U.S Congress and on the house side but Democrats are unlikely to pick up any races\nIn the Senate well the top two races of the issues of course there's going to be about the issue of the economy Stephen Moore economist says that well you know companies are doing quite well Republicans she'd be able to capitalize on the company's waging excuse me raising wages and overtime for workers out\nThere and let the nineties was the biggest boom and biggest increase in middle class incomes like American history but in the tooth out since two thousand\nThey've level off and and you're right we need to get wages going but scientists wages if you look at for example the big deal for workers right now are going way more overtime pay because there's such a tight labor market is you mentioned ... ... ... ...\nYou got what was the company last week Amazon two hundred and fifty thousand I mean all these companies um Disney just announced\nEverything's doing well prices are going up but Moore says that the Republicans want to do better he says they've done a horrible job on selling the economy and tax cuts ... [noise]\nWell I think you put it well in your introduction that Republicans have won a kind of the battle but they are winning the public relations\nBattle here I mean the economy is extremely strong cranes buildings or you know factories warehouses apartment buildings condos is the biggest construction but when the United states history right now [laughter] uh and so Republicans haven't done a great job of selling as they\nOnce said that he says the economy there ... it's it's roaring here Roger but it's not been properly\nLaid out by the Republicans who just got into a little debate with liberal TV host from the hill dot com crystal ball who sat back and say well wait a second why is it President Obama from the Democrats getting any credit and we had this conversation before\nBecause John good strong but at the lower than it was under the Obama administration in order to get those numbers scientists and they're you know the last year and they say so we had our share of the time they're\nAlso keep bringing up Obama deserves credit more says let me break it down for you when you look at the Trump economy versus the Obama economy when it comes to the election\nBy our economy or is it like I was growing\nUp one and a half percent and oh by last last year one ... percent that's very close to being a recession it's our four that's the difference between Fifteen miles an hour an hour forty miles\nSo there you go he says that's the difference Fifteen miles an hour and forty to fifty miles an hour over the last couple of days there was an article we have in Florida daily dot com Congressman Ron dissenters or former Congressman Ron descent as the Republican nominee for governor here in Florida\nHopes to capitalize and this is a great talking point but does it translates to a victory he was at some of the rallies he's now saying that Democrats and progressives or want to ensure the Obama legacy and they're looking at through the eyes of Andrew Gillum I'm sure that'll be uses another race tactic by the left but\nHe says that they want to revive the Obama legacy in Florida he says that the gubernatorial election does have national implications and then\nAndrew Gillum is nothing but Obama two point oh eight sounds great and I I I Will admit that but let's remind everybody that President Obama won Florida back to back\nExactly that probably will get the Republicans fired up to vote for Sanders but you know it likewise will get Democrats fire it up to vote for Andrew Gillum so the question\nAlso it's been brought a project and I I think this is a win win for the census impossibly this would also let's say that have Gillum was running for ... years but let's say that President Obama was the was the president a run just answer says listen I I've been supported\nBy been endorsed by President Trump he says for the most part he says uh I've got a one way conversation with the president if any thing happens here in Florida\nAnd I was able to talk to the president want to thank him for his support I Want to thank him for and trust me with a viewing me if somebody who can be a great leader for Florida says thank you Mr President\nI mean does it sound like if you wanted to get what they say the independence or even some of the song Democrats or maybe a few moderate Republicans and maybe ...\nIs it is it is it I think it may be benefit to Sanders that's that would benefit Gillum again if Obama was president by sit back saying any tragedies like with a hurricane that anything they may happen here in the state of Florida I have a direct line to the president or what do you think you know I think\nThat is a risk though but he's taking in the kind of ... the president's reputation because he has gotten a little bit of flack President Trump asked is not being as responsive to the wildfires in California because California didn't vote for him and not being assumed to Puerto Rico because the Puerto Ricans are primarily on the left\nAnd they said that if you vote for him yeah well that would benefit Florida if he gets elected\nI think ... was a little bit off you know I think that's the one thing I think you can forget the California hit Puerto Rican I think I get this was Gillum and then I said there's an Obama was depressed and I think it could benefit Gillum as well it's a good campaign the question is does it does it go anywhere with maybe ... ... it probably\nWould I think it would would help a little bit with that but you know I'm concerned about the president's reputation at the same time\nIt's All right more as we continue to move along what's the latest with the hurricanes\nGovernor Rick Scott and the F ... chief financial officer of the state Jimmy ... says horizon is not moving quick enough they've called out for rising over the last few days apparently frustrated by how slow the cell carrier has been\nTo restore service to the hardest areas hit by hurricane Michael ... you know what I'm most and what do you agree with this or not it just seems it's almost like it's a campaign thing by Rick Scott and I like right I Know\nJimmy ... a good guy Jimmy ... a friend of the show having said that you see it so it just seems like a ... is rising for moving too slowly getting sell services at a realistic criticism other cell company\nKnow what you you can't blame of arrives in already you know private business for being slow and getting back to business they're losing money basically for not having it up there working as quickly as they can to blame the private company I think it's probably a little bit\nCould lose the care they've got or on health insurance where we're dealing with the failed Obamacare ...\nNow let me stop right there so he says you can and he brings a very interesting places you can kiss it all get by you know because if you thought over by the way all these people campaign for Obamacare yeah it wasn't a prelude to what they want it I'm sure it was because he thought Obamacare is bad this was\nWorse you know kind of reminds me of the way you described it as the school system where if you're the average person you're\nStuck with what the school system gives you and maybe they may offer a magnet program but if you had money you take your kids out of that with the quickness and get them into private school\nHere to those of you out there that for the idea of a universal healthcare Medicare for all single option however you want to paint at here's my question who's your doctor\nWho's your doctor going to be I mean they're gonna have to be I mean remember they're going to have to watch someone government approved\nRemember the government sets the cost and things like that when it comes to certain areas of Medicaid and things like that and the government's done a good job with that but now they want to go further and go after doctors and everything else it just put in this is kind of an interesting take\nListen to this clip but he also says that remember years ago I did interviews with the with the Obama crowd the surrogates like University of South Florida and those in Gainesville that all of the Obamacare they love the Medicaid expansion and none of the prices they all say well to the level off years down the road\nEvidently prices are somewhat coming down but according to Alex days are the H H A secretary it's not because of Obama but it's because of President Trump's e buy into this but the\nFailed Obamacare programs for the first time ever\nObamacare plans the benchmark premium his down almost two percent under President Trump's leadership to stabilize the market still on affordable it still insurance people don't necessarily want buddies at least stabilized and price came down for the first time ever President Trump's campaign to get rid of Obamacare is doing a better job managing Obamacare and the guy who wrote the bill\nNow of course the Obamacare crowd will not agree with that they'll sit back and say Roger well hey evidently we told you it was going to take place here's the latest from some of the Democrats on the health care and Medicare for all coming up for the November election [noise]\nPeople don't\nWant to\n\nSay that we're going to weaken Medicare coverage for the elderly is outrageous like we expand coverage to include dental care vision care and hearing hearing aid\nYeah that's great so we spend all of this to cover all this again folks we can't properly covering now so what do we do we just expand it\n... two things first of all doctors are not taking Medicare and maybe cases they used that is true or Medicaid and we don't take this sorry go to a different doctor or you'll have long waiting lists that could come down the pike\nSo again so now you hear what the left who said they say well it's become more expensive if we don't deal with this issue so the question I keep asking\nIs why on the Medicare for all I mean again in the VHS secretary I think something I mean I'm already receiving emails people said yeah he is exactly correct I'm On a group of health care plan I don't want to be lumped in with everybody else in fact that's the problem some would say from the left Roger ... we don't want to\nLump with everybody else another thing that had left that they all want to be lumped you got some of those out there I Know we like our plan that's the reason why we pay for a planet so we get better coverage\nIf you end up ... you know forcing reduction in costs and therefore say should I Wonder whether or not it will be a disincentive for people to pursue careers as doctors if you can't make the money that you would make today for example\nElizabeth Warren has come out and said that she does have\nCherokee Indians she as DNA and said ancestry from being a Native American here with the latest that Fox News Tucker\nCarlson case but one of the test results because she's produced actually say\nWe're going to war and she may have had one unnamed and still on indentified Indian ancestor not necessarily from North America by the way eight or so generations ago potentially\nNow that could make her less than one one thousand American indian that's about roughly as American indian has virtually every white person I've ever met which is to say not American indian at all\nAnd actual Indians are disgusted by it\nThe Cherokee Nation just this afternoon released a statement they called ... claims inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses well also is honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens in other words it's bad for Indian\nAnd yet the media is acting like she does have it she may be she's being that misleading people out there putting this nonsense even after the DNA tests show that she is not Indian some would say it turns out that she's left Native American with the DNA than the average non Native American according to the daily mail dot com\nYou know what you go back far enough and we're all related you know probably hope hopefully it won't matter\nThe ... you know what you go back far enough and we're all related you know probably hope hopefully it won't\nMatter or don't say this I mean I got about your Thanksgiving ... let me tell you something I said it before and I will say it to the remainder of the show\nI have more crypt Tony in one of the planet ... dog from Joelle I have more comic book I Am more clinical Tony and DNA in mind that she has an earth size zero superheroes I Am a superhero Cornell law professor bill Jacobson says you know what she was a complete fake\nNo it doesn't settle anything at all in fact it raises more questions here you need to understand how deceptive Elizabeth Warren was in claiming Native American heritage Native American ancestry\nDid not claim it when she was a child she didn't claim it for college she didn't claim it for law school she only claimed it when she was in her late thirties and beginning to climb the law school ladder law professor ladder from the University of Texas to Harvard that's the only time she's ever cleaned\nAny also points out if she was such a had a lot of history and a lot of DNA why didn't she get involved with any of the clubs of American native when she was in college\nShe never affiliated with Native Americans she never help Native Americans she was never a faculty advisor for Native Americans she got herself listed as Native American so she can be declared a minority law professor\nBut the bottom line is do you think if he runs do you think people are going to vote against Ron this I don't think so I think I think if you like or dislike or it's going to be based on the issue\nIs going to be big swimming issue if you like liberals Yoel for that's basically it I agree\nMore as we continue to move along tripled to talk triple to eight to\nFive five view wants them to for ... yeah All right let's go to Mike Mike good morning you're on WB obey\nHey good morning at a I won't talk to you about Medicare for all first of all let's stipulate that I one of those people displaced by the Obamacare I'm self employed and I can't I don't want to pay twenty thousand a year for sure you don't make that taught me we just gave up our twenty thousand dollars a year on health care but\nUh but so so they know what I was going to be motivated to go for Medicare for all that would be but I Lived in Australia for nine years and we Medicare for all their ... and I'm I'm sure the leftist are going to be holding up\nUp as a model again not this election season or the other thing is there's a whole different monster in Australia people actually work people actually\nPay taxes you know much more people I don't know the exact number but I Would say at least twice as many people pay taxes\nIn Australia's America even if you have a low job working at McDonalds you're still paying taxes\nRight they don't pay taxes here and\nIn your past or get beat up on on on a preaching and talk about culture and how wrong it is to be a pleasure that someone that that which is off the government so uh so it's very very turned\nLooked down upon you to be a much in for that so much you know they they're victims chair button and Australia there still bumps\nYeah they call it the kind of interesting if it's like your

Andrew Gillum is a to point ...\nYeah and if for over Andrew Gillum it's probably a complement and he probably which are described as would say that we're all for that which is that what actually ended up firing up those on the left\nProbably yeah I Wonder if it would have to I mean just to sum it said that well hey that's probably the the most campaigning to Santa's has done that is what they're saying now myself but then again the question is is this enough to push dissent is over the goal line and we'll continue to talk about this here in a few moments\nTripled to talk nine zero for tripled to eight to five five years or ... as we ask a lot of questions here this morning number one\nWhy use the debt and deficit so high that the what\nIs it because the tax cuts is because of spending is it slowly reliable and the problem on on entitlements number two who's to blame is a Trump is it the Republicans is it President Obama number three\nAre the majority of Americans according to the latest Fox News poll want the government to become more involved with health care why is that there is an answer that I have but I Want to know what you think\nWhy do the government why didn't the majority of people out there want the government to become more involved in your health care triple to talk it tripled to ... by the way Ron just Sanders also in our latest article says that the that\nYou should elect Tim this is a great line because he's got a one and then he got a direct line to the president of the United states that is correct but of course of Andrew Gillum it bronco bottle was the president Andrew Gillum could use that same technique do you think that sells\nYou know what I think it does some independent voters probably which dealt with a lot of those who were the not a party affiliated with soft ah Republicans yeah that may may be a selling point\nOkay so I'm I'm kind of fears that evening Jews and here's another question before we get a break I Want to hear from you a ... to talk triple to eight to five five Roger Sanchez maintains that the gubernatorial election has national implications\nThe Florida Democratic Party says that dissent has only been talk about health care what he'll do state wide round the San Francisco says he'll be the most pro life governor Florida's ever seen folks is that a state issue\nIs there is to I mean what do you agree with Gillum and most people would not on his Medicaid and Medicare expansion all that stuff\nHas Ron dissenters shown a plan what he would do better for Florida or is it just attack attack attack on give up I like to hear from you what do you think I triple to talk tripled to eight to five five talk radio W.

health care there's a certain reason I'm ... there's a certain answer I'm looking for and why\nAre the Democrats out performing the Republicans on this aisle bread Barrett was asking this question of

promise you can keep your health plan or you can keep your doctor because they know that's not the case the hundred and Seventy eight million of the others who got employer insurance that would go away under some of these proposals your doctor\nYou wouldn't get to keep your doctor because your doctor would flee these Medicare lower rates and we'd have a two tier system of health care where they move into a cash systems outside of this Medicare so American seniors would lose their doctors they could lose their hospitals could lose the care they've got you know now\nWhat is he doing he's presenting something and yet they even talk about Obamacare prices may be going down a tad but he gets credit for that or\nOn health insurance where we're dealing with the failed Obamacare program for

can be a great leader for Florida says thank you Mr President I Will\nAdmit even if this was Andrew Gillum and of course let's say a bronco bomber was still in the White House here Roger it'd be great selling point to some salt voters out there are undecided independents\nAnd this guy's got a quick or pick up line to a disaster or something happens to the White House some people will sit back and

life I heard and they look at it that clock and you've got we just get a download but you know things are working well if it ain't broke don't fix it down and the economy goes to hell cares right\nAnyway that's uh that's what they do not the people are just not\nConcerned about a lot this working you know they get their paycheck and they live their life but to get the deficit down at things go to hell they called us they're thinking they tried that in Europe it didn't work too\nWell each Friday after the fact that they pretty much went bankrupt won the ... when there was at the dollar but the money was devalued and grace and so why is that everybody cares about what a gems in the White House but nobody cares about it when the Republicans in the White House\nAnd it gives us our side is always right there side is always wrong even when you do the exact same things\nThere are a lot of things that I'm unhappy about\nThere are a lot of things that\nThere are a lot of things that\nWe shouldn't have had in this field but we were\nIn a sense forced if we want to build our military we were forced to have there are some things that we should have it in the bill\nBut I say that Congress I Will never sign another bill like this again but he did\nNot going to do it again [noise] nobody read it [noise] it's only hours old didn't\nBut listen you know I Love the the policies of President Trump love the deregulation I Love the tax cuts but again the Republicans put forward these bills folks not the Democrats nobody read it wasn't because of the Democrats because of the Republican\n[noise] some people don't even know what it is at one point three trillion dollars just a second largest ever [noise] and because the Democrats\nWho don't believe in that ... and things that they wanted in order to get their votes [noise] we have to get rid of the filibuster rules [noise] we have to get rid\nWill Mitch McConnell can certainly do that at the time or remember Rand Paul says it does build down by the Republicans that help create again the largest deficit in five years he said these bills could have been written by President Obama former President Obama and the Democrats\nGot old school I think ... you know before we vote on this is a twenty two hundred page bill\nAs far as the content of the bill and this could have been written by President Obama and liberal Democrats because when the Republicans are out of power when they're in the minority they are the conservative party but then when they get in the majority there is no conservative era immigrants don't care about spending any of the time Republicans seem to care about it when they're criticizing Democrats\nBut now the Republicans are in charge Republicans are like Katy bar the door\nAnd remember what a what Rand Paul you heard what he just said real quick remember Lindsey Graham when he said about the spending\nA we're not in debt because of discretionary spending we're in there because Medicare Medicaid and Social Security or just exploding and calls that two thirds of the federal budget and what do you do about it this is what he recommended challenge the Democrats like a Tip O'Neill\nThey adjusted the age of retirement for Social Security in Nineteen eighty three it extended the life of Social Security by about forty okay you\nDid you hear what was said and what was inside again we're not talking about cutting any government spending we're not even talking about modifying the issues of Medicare and Social Security I mean he but he just tweaked it a lot of little bit of your taxes and maybe maybe maybe if you allow Roger\nFifty cents of that and say fifty percent but fifty cents or the six six and a half percent ... that you have to pay into to go to maybe a little\nBit of a privatization we we can tweak that we're not even do that\nGeorge W. Bush tried it and the Democrats stopped him\nActually the Republicans are on the Senate the time so they they were some of the Republicans that want to go with it but then again it could have happened I agree but when I'm also getting at is that Lindsey Graham who I like a lot he says well no we let's just let's just increase the eligibility age for Social Security maybe the possibility of Medicare okay so let's say we make it solvent for another Twenty years been or do we do want to what now with the kick it up to\nEighty ... I mean I I don't\nHear anything addressing the issue except well in order to make it solvent instead of but people are uh you know at sixty two sixty five or Seventy\nI mean what's next we're not allow people for the rock by race not to take out money before there or you\nKnow after fifty nine and a half now everything else so you know what I mean we're going to take up the sixty nine\nOut of there are a lot of people to add on Social Security who are not elderly but they have been declared disability for things like well they can't find a job and they have a back ache maybe bats increasing some of the spending we're doing with the Social Security dispersed\nTripled to talk love to hear from you tripled to talk tripled to eight to five five Hillary Clinton says there is no abuse of power when asked by CBS said about the me too movement and her husband\nSome today have said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned getting away because of the Monica Lewinsky stand absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now [laughter]\nI just love and she is so quick to the answer here\nRetrospectively you saying\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky stand absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at\nThe evidence for the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with him in terms of power imbalance in adults\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current income than\nThe current income do something when he was on the job you know not in the middle of the law for certainly we know that just kind of curious about that\nNow you hold on air change from Jennifer that finally met again anywhere in this class\nYou know an argument when you're a meeting responses won't work it out for being wrong for all those years I don't have a way to\nFor the incoming on her and her not hung up to\nHillary Clinton is the best fix are out there are bad\nYou know what you expected to have to defend Bill Clinton metro husband\nBut she probably needs to be coached and some better answers and she's been trained to give no no he didn't do anything wrong because that's just not out of stand by your man talk radio W.

I Believe I guys were in the ballpark but that's what I was looking I agree with\nYou as well and one of the definitions of with a conservative is the one who likes things to stay the way they are and I think that's probably part of the reasons why the Republicans have offered in anything new but just keep it the way it is let's not change anything\nTime let's take some calls in as a triple to talk triple to eight to five five let's go to Shawn John good morning you're on WB obey\nYour morning dean uh or at I'm Sorry no you're you're fine yeah yeah a\nCouple of things on the on the insurance will number one\nThe government or on the people wanted a government more involved\nBecause they're going to fold their hands and figure those going to be some sort of support and then it it can be eventually free or whatever [noise] big insurance companies remember\nThere are very entrenched in this Medicare part of the business all your big three or four without mentioning names bam group research but the big big big money comes from Medicare\nSo they're not going to block that horse so now better ... mixed up about forty two to forty six percent of the business\nSo those are consistent dollars coming in among showing last Fifteen Twenty years so they're not going to fight the government on the individual side or groups either interest or have to work its way out because that's that's what I think and I'm I'm\nNot either you Shaun you you really nailed it but John let me let me be a little bit more specific here if I if I can play this role for\nSure when when when the poll says that they want\nWant is a future tense\nSo they want the government to become more involved that's my question why did the majority of Americans want the government to become more involved I think I just think that insurance companies have been a horrible job as you point out they have no problem with getting in bed with the government and I think many of those on the political aisle did a horrible job of promoting more free marketplace ideas\nRight and what's gonna happen is is that you see the people are now figured okay or throwing a chow or are you know thinking that the government will subsidize for whatever him and in my opinion and I'm going to ... or ... will get Medicare\nAll the fraud and medics your if you look at the stash eighty billion dollars in it it comes from a fee for service side not private sector\nOr like your companies that are involved with Medicare the ones that Medicare Advantage so they don't check Rajoy or do acquaintance situation in five seconds all the fraud is coming from\nThe fee for service side where there is no controls except the government that that is a ministry supplant\nOkay now you bring up a very valid point and by the way the Obamacare was sold on Medicare fraud as\nWell ... member Andy Griffith memory and immigrant back in Nineteen sixty four we got the voting rights and that's one Medicare came out of that ad have interests us all but when it comes again\n... member that ad have interest is all but when it comes to again I understand he's coming from I mean okay so you want the government the government to involve dealing with Medicare fraud but\nAgain I use it as a future tense question when you get people to say that we want the government why do they want the government become more involved when why did the Democrats do such a better job than the Republicans because they do a better PR job\nWhy do people want to move the Jacksonville in St Johns county clay compared to South Florida because why Jacksonville in northeast Florida does a better PR job than the rest of the south Florida and also based on things that have happened in the past as well\nYou know what I'm saying yeah it's all about the PR here Joel good morning drunk WB obey\nHey good morning I mean I think one of the things driving people trusting may be the Democrats for a little bit more stability or support for health care in the future is um\nPeople are really pinched filling the inflationary effects of healthcare costs to the economy is doing very well right now unemployment is low a lot of folks are working and people do have healthcare coverage but um I think the underlying problem is is the health care isn't fleeting much faster than the economy is growing\nAnd by the way that you know they're stimulated effective tax cuts we still are not making up for a you know the revenue loss so\nThese problems will continue to pound but I think it's the cost of healthcare it's taking a bigger and bigger and bigger bite our middle class and working and working folks um I think they're looking to the Democratic party traditionally they have for ... comic relief\nI'm with you I listen I liked your perspective on that I Would differ with you on on the tax cuts\nIf the tax cuts were going to spend one point five trillion for ten years Trump just signed a budget a one point three trillion continued resolution bill right so that could mean that alone a bit self the tax cuts of what he paid if the spending that we have the problem with but I think Joel's exactly right\nIf we knew that costs are going to go up you just look for the slower decreasing of cost\nThat's how you have to look at it some would say I think its base a lot of on the on the PR job I mean eight hundred ... excuse me seven hundred and twenty billion taken out from Medicare to fund Obamacare have you heard that from the Republicans no\nIt's it's it is it as as ... going to tell you right now it's going to lie number three John good morning on WB you'll be John I think you've nailed it it's a messaging problem\nIt's absolutely that's a hundred percent I mean the Republicans are not getting their message out uh I mean that's that that's a whole the whole deal at all you know the whole ball of wax right there I mean it's a rises too I mean there's ... and the yellow even be on the rise\nAnd in a rather than us out to be alive and as a and it gets messages yeah their their their side of the story I mean we're not telling the Republican side of the story and it's all that gets told\nOh we're going to take it all and that is in this in this campaign and also Bill Nelson I mean yeah in the shade all the way along and got back from when he was that the commissioner of insurance for a state of Florida he was the worst insurance commissioner ... absolutely wrecked the insurance that just back in the nineties\nYeah I've heard a lot about that I got to run John I I mean I'm up against the clock right now I put a John says it's the messaging I think that's where it comes down to you get a job you get a contract based on your pie are based on your message that you have to compete with other people and right now the Republicans are losing it forty eight minutes after the our talk radio W.
