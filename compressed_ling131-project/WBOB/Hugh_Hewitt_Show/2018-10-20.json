Franklin bridge\nAnd before I left I was on my computer a little bit again in a news alert type of a email saying that the north bound part of the Howard Franklin bridge was closed\nWill further went on to explain that a car have was uh going the wrong way on the on the north bound or\nA side of the bridge there in collided with another van driver the car was killed\nThe driver of the band was injured severely\nSo the north bound lanes of the Howard Franklin bridge going to be close you know if it's a fatality they're going to be closed at least two two or three hours\nSo you have an a driver going the wrong way on a bridge killed another person\nSo I immediately said well gee I came not going to be able to go across the aisle Franklin bridge like planned then I hear a report there was an accident on the game the bridge so my only recourse of then of course was to go across to coordinate Campbell British [noise]\nSo uh and that caused me more than probably an hour delay getting where I was going on the way back from Gainesville\nTraffic came to a halt\nSet there are no movement whatsoever for over two hours just sitting there\nI see the flat bed record trucks passing me two of those past in about a half an hour after I had stopped and then the other one passed about an hour and a half ... stopped the fatality\nAs a as I finally cleared over two hours later we see where there was another fatality on the other side of Seventy five Seventy five coming back from Gainesville\nSo and then we saw the ... the ambulance and the police court escort and all that so you know that was a fatality so what I'm saying is you can go out and you can get in your car one morning\nAnd you can never come back in why that's important to here once in a while is is your stay playing really up to date\nOr some of those people were injured so their their state signing should've needed to be updated\nA social life can be very very short I I was I saw that first hand yesterday on a trip back and forth to Gainesville to see a family member who see a couple of family members actually uh and it just brings to mind that you all need we all need to be really prepared\nFor that to happen to us or in our family and we all need to prepare their estate planning documents getting them updated the surgery and poor and everything is going to the Indians going to happen to you like

Clearwater\nJak\nYeah my question is uh [noise] this is a husband and wife retired ribbon mistake [noise] I'm happy to one of them get sick you know there's all that mistake [noise]\nNo the uh when we do stay planning for documents are documents for clients that come in we do one of the documents who usually prepare for clients after explaining to them as a terrible poverty attorney\nAnd that power attorney under a fairly new statue there um block she can check off to medicate planning\nSo there are three paragraphs on a married couple I usually get them to check these off in case one of them going nursing home in the future the paragraphs pertain to being able to move assets around into a non cannibal exempt asset so you could preserve and protect your state and qualify for Medicaid\nSo\nIt's very very important to have this power returning document that allow someone to ah create a personal service contract to create a qualified income trucks trust to be able to move assets into non accountable categories\nAnd so that's very important to have that so if you and your wife have those documents and what have you went into the nursing home to communities spouse can keep the homestead asset that's an uncomfortable asset\nCan keep a between a hundred and twenty and a hundred and thirty thousand dollars is also known cannibal and have the ability to move other assets around to make them non cannibal so they can qualify for Medicaid\nSo yeah there is a way to protect most of your assets and still qualify for Medicaid not have to dip into those accounts [noise] uh so you so you both have nothing in the end in both would have to go on Medicaid there's different service that's\nWhere it is actually going to do that\nWell I Would suggest to meet with an attorney if you don't have more than I'd be glad to a few to call me if you if you like and then you get some of these documents for pears you get a healthcare surrogate prepared to get a durable power of attorney prepared that allows you to make medical decisions and move assets around the qualify for Medicaid\nYou can move assets around you can get a terrible poverty attorney that allows for Medicaid planning to be done you can move assets into the communities spouses name\nThat's not a gift there is a five year look back period on gifting that could disqualify you for part of those years\nThe VA has just created new look back rules on their VA trust\nA VHS you could usually ... you could do as a trust for VA\nAnd you could create an every local trust for ... and then even if you were in assisted living there was a thousand to two thousand dollar benefit you could get in their aid and attendance a VA program\nWell now there is a five year there's a three year look back period

this morning and asked about well the or who should be the trustee if you let's say you create a living trust avoid probate avoid guardianship make it quick easy fast the fish and have a private document\nSo you create this document or you're thinking about creating this document and the question becomes who who would be the best successor trustee to yourself to take over and manage things\nAre to follow the instructions you've laid out for the trust\nWell every family's different\nSometimes a there's a difference let's say you want to leave everything our rights and one child who's very responsible child but for some reason you shouldn't leave everything a right to the second child could be Spencer its problems could\nBe would blow a whole a large sum of money would lowest quickly\nCould manage it be maybe the child's under the control of a spouse who would spend maybe there's an addiction maybe there's a government benefit a situation where if they got money they would lose it who should be the trustee well it can be a family member\nIt can be an attorney or CPAs experiencing this\nCould could be a corporate trustee like banks have trusted parliament's brokerage houses trusts departments [noise] it's really just took a very good discussion you should have with uh the attorney creating these documents to choose the best choice let's go to Marie in

give away more than Fifteen thousand you fill out of seven and nine give tax return and then you can use a part of your\nUm lifetime exemption\n[noise]\nThat Sullivan million dollars per person right now [noise]\nSorry you gave away a hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars just to use an example like yeah so you can give away Fifteen or that reporting it so you fill out of seven o nine give tax return and then you you say you gave away a hundred thousand\n[laughter] and then you would have ten million nine hundred thousand left that you could give but if you give away more than Fifteen it just reduces your lifetime exemption\nNow\nAll right thank you thank you\nKnow a lot of people know the lotto numbers\nAre huge it was Donald Trump let's say huge\n[noise] ah one of them is a ... a billion dollars do them was close to five hundred million dollars\nUm and I know there are certain ... radio stations to carry this program their pastors would say you know don't play the lotto that's evil it's harmful you should earn your money I'm working hard every day so\nBut if you did when if you did play a I've represented for a lot of winters in my career I've represented three seven million dollar one isn't one thirty nine million dollar winter\nUh one of the sevens and the thirty nine million dollar winter hired me for the day to go to Tallahassee to collect the price up in through the process a twice of assessing a client who won a lot of money at all in the line of what should you do\nWell first of all you want to have a good accounting CPA and legal advice on collecting the money the timing of collecting the money and how the money should be collected uh some people would create a a trust some\nPeople deal have a little ah family deal going on where the ... all chip and money and they would all be\nSplit the winnings if an older person were to be a single person winter\nUh then there'd be huge tax consequences whereas if a family won the prize thing you create a trust and have a family accept the money and then you have a lot of people in the younger generation have access to the money\nAnd it wouldn't be there in their state when they guy yeah that was eleven million dollar exemption but if you win hundreds of millions of dollars and die then there'd be a huge tax on that money so there's a lot that goes into the planning for a lot of winter\nAnd like I said I've represented for a lot of winners along the way and if you have any questions about that ah that would be a fun question so let's so let me give out the numbers for anyone

to David in Gulfport paid on\nYour call Joe\nPleasure um most of my assets that are in horror ... is our traditional Irish or Irish ... should I shop a trust for those or should they just stay beneficiaries coffee\nWell it depends on what you want to accomplish in your state plan a if you have benefits for his name and all those I Do that would go to the beneficiaries directly so they all of the older\nAnd and they're going to be the beneficiary\nAnd how old are they there are thirty and thirty thirty thirty three thirty\nAnd are they children you'd want to leave an outright distribution or would you want to stretch it out for a bit for a one or both of them\nWould stretch it I think for the grandkids you're talking about\nWell no the beneficiaries TV it's empty fifty to two kids or do you want to have some for your grandkids\nChunk of the grandkids also\n[noise] All right so it probably council you to ah see I don't know the values of the different IRAs but it would be easier to have the Ross IRAs come into a trust where you can control that\nThe non Ross IRAs if you want to do a stretch she'd make the trust the beneficiary and then to find the terms of the stretch a lotta people be defined terms of the stretcher they could get your required minimum distribution\nYou know for their lifetime so they have a some money coming out every month and you can control it that way but\nThat trust trust to share that point or\nThey'll have to be special language and the trust not to ... sense of trust is not a person\nThere to be special language and the trust not to cause an adverse tax situation on the uh beneficiary being the trust\nFund or off there is no tax situation so that I was a lot of different but the regular IRAs and four one K. is you have to have special language in there so all the taxes are into it once when the trust becomes a beneficiary and then you can do it there's just special language you put it in the trust\nSo you have to be careful that languages in there so when it hits the troughs all the taxes are too you know just be taxes and when it comes out of them the monthly amount would be the taxes that came out of the trust if those special languages in there\nAbout a second home this is a separate question if I can I ask are affecting the would be should be included and trust or is the cost base which you know some\nYou know the costs basis as in change from a transfer from you to the trust on a second home or even the first film\nOr so but it's still gets the stepped up costs basis of the time of death so
