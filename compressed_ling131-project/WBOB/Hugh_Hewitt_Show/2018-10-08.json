B. O. B. so let's get to everybody knows what just happened and yet how important is it really that over the weekend\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty\nThe Naser forty eight [noise]\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nWell it is done but before we get to the gym say well no no no don't act like he's going to be up there for a long time\nBecause she didn't we always told everybody that you know how the Democrats all over the map and how they want to address Kavanaugh sexual allegations not the right temperament he's too extreme\nMember will we told you that Democrats and those of liberal groups were already saying that Kavanaugh will have to recuse himself because he is tainted from upcoming Supreme Court decisions is was even talked about just recently by the wall Street Journal editorial report\nThat was an angry Brett Kavanaugh had last month's Senate Judiciary committee hearing and as he prepares to take his seat on the Supreme Court this week critics are pointing to that performance to argue that Canada are lax judicial temperament they also claimed that the political nature of his remarks will require that he recused himself from certain the high court cases going for\nTalk of course none of the questions that the Democrats senators asked him that he couldn't talk about but I lost Shapiro from the Supreme Court review from the ... Institute said\nHim a different judge than it was before I'm Brett Kavanaugh I mean he seems very well adjusted uh\nAnd now there's a difference between judicial temperament a when you've been accused of gang rape and all the rest of it versus uh twelve years on the bench and glowing reviews or you know I've seen them in person how we act as a judge and no complaints\nNo complaints there and yet the question is is now is you know going into the second week in October\nThe Supreme Court has already started some of the big issues that are going to have to take place some issues that even some conservatives and liberals are looking at what is coming up possibly that may be a big another contrast between the two groups again I repeat or from the ... Institute says the issues of roe versus Wade are not going to be there\nNow guns maybe but he says another big one the\nBiggest one I think that will have the potential changing is affirmative action and racial preferences a trial starts in two weeks in Boston a lawsuit against a Harvard University if and when that gets up in the Supreme Court in two years or so that could be a big change in this forty year old experiment with use of racial preferences\nOr other things made me aware and Robie waiter abortion gets talked about but remember John Roberts is the middle of the court the chief justice we haven't had a chance as in the middle of the corn jurors potentially in quite some time since the thirties I think and so things like that will only go as far as fast as he wants to take a ...\nAnd now the other big question is are the Democrats going to be happy with this New Jersey senator Cory Booker said this past weekend at the possibility of impeaching Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nShould not be off the tables at the Democrats would both houses in next month's election remember ABC News George Stephanopoulos with ... New York congressman Jared ...\nDo you want to pick up on what day personal and plus he was saying All right there are a lot of Democrats have said that they don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh told the truth when he went before the Judiciary Committee if it turns out that he does become justice Kevin and your chairman of the ... community would you invest seen him for a possible impeachment is other\nUh\nThings and ruin things including perjury this has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court and and the Senate haven't investigated than anything else will have to\nInvestigate we would have to investigate any credible allegations certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before\nBut somebody who kind of knocked it out of the ballpark just recently George Washington university law professor Jonathan Turley says\nYou know what I mean you could investigate the dead where do you stop this he gives this will be totally dreadful\nFor the country I so sure you could have a trial for the dead if you want it or the confirmed\nBut it is a dreadful idea I think the framers created this process they have some finality now the Democrats may not like the outcome of the vote but fifty over fifty ... senators are expected to be satisfied with this record\nAnd to confirmed this nominee if we're going to start to do do over as every time the majority changes then we will never have a stable court\nDie continue to do do overseas but now what you had the biggest questions is when you look past now their capital just confirmed now he will be the U.S Supreme Court\nTo kind of like the election how will the media\nRespond how well the media look at themselves remembered even Joe Scarborough promoting Joseph that thought they were too biased against President Trump and Brett Kavanaugh\nFormer CNN director cheap bureau chief who's the director of the public affairs at George Washington university Frank says though says there the media is going to have to look at how they covered it because it technically was too negative\nFollowing through on what he said which was to remake the Supreme Court and try and put Kavanaugh himself\nThe coverage has been unrelenting Lee negative\nAbout what the public and what the White House um come away from this way is a you know some some fair territory to wag their fingers and say I told you so even Joe Scarborough goes on the air and says the mainstream media were unfair toward the president\nSo there's going to be some very serious thinking now I think the challenge grows even greater for the media to figure out where it's going and how it's going to try to find some balance and all of\nTake a look at this so basically what we've looked at his impeachment is still on the table\nBalance and all of those take a look at this so basically what we've looked at his impeachment is still on the table even if they win one house they don't win the Senate they're still going to try to get another round here so they're not happy this is nothing more than just a glorified do over of what happened to two thousand sixteen\nSecond of all when you go back and there are some you know is there any ... very entertaining about YouTube or Google Google the election predictions of two thousand sixteen\nAnd then look at the aftermath of the same people that predicted that we're all in tears here's the tissue for your issue I think the same thing could almost be warranted of how the media and the Senator Sheldon Whitehouse wanted to look at flatulence\nPassing gas jokes at a high school yearbook about whether or not Nineteen eighty five there was a bar fight and whether or not that Brett Kavanaugh back then as a college student dug through ISIS somebody\nWebster from the Fox business news that after Amazon raised their minimum wage the Fifteen who'd be old dirty Bernie Sanders had the progressive left says now everybody should raise it even for all you small McDonald business companies out there especially your franchise owners\nIs happening now Bernie Sanders is going out to McDonald's sell me more about writing a letter saying this Amazon it does make them pay Fifteen dollars an hour ... Donald which made five point one billion dollars in profits last year\nYou know can I can I just asked the question how you compared\nI get I don't expect politicians to understand about owning\nThe corporate and then you have a franchise we're always a franchise really doesn't get much system for corporate out there I mean even your dealerships out there but you're Ford dealership so I mean yeah they have a co op but the individual that Ford dealership\nHas to pay for everything when it comes to income jobs ... when it comes to health care employment everything else\nHow does McDonalds get lumped in with\nDisney which is worth billions and Amazon which is what a trillion dollar company\nRight gray and the average McDonalds you go to is not owned by McDonalds as you mentioned the dome by individual operator and the average\nProfit margin Andrew Lih per restaurant owners who have fifty thousand a year to the owner makes that's why a lot of them have more than one story interests there and not necessarily raking it a lot of money the individual owners per restaurants and uh the minimum wage jobs that's pretty much after\nSchool summer jobs for kids right you know very few adults are living on minimum wage and I\nYou know we do we take calls from listeners it this is a very passionate issue and the question I keep asking it let me just act like a moderate per second okay let's say\nFor example John Morgan very successful in getting the marijuana member on the ballot new thousand fourteen to pray looted the two thousand sixty wants to put it to get on the ballot twenty twenty by the minimum wage\nSome say ten dollars an hour twelve bucks an hour or just automatically go to Fifteen\nThe question is that if you look at like a liberal first second or a moderate\nIf he wanted to go for Fifteen bucks an hour let's say for big companies Harris GE which has companies here in Florida does the okay let's say you had a valid excuse\nBut how do you know one wants to get exemptions to smaller businesses lying right ten employees or less those even talking about that that's why I said let me act like a moderate the second question I like to ask is that is just a ploy biggest Fifteen may be too high but if Democrats can come in and say well Tony Tony Roger\nWill compromise will go for a ten to twelve dollars an hour minimum wage will voters fall for that\nYou know what they might you know I I think people did they have a heart you know they don't want to see a single mom struggling but the fact of the matter is the minimum wage jobs are not going even to the single moms for the most part they're going to like I mentioned to she wanted a job after school\nKids who want a summer job maybe a seasonal job around Christmas Time it's not your average person I worried to survive\nSo you think ... and I want to hear from the audience at the moment you think if there was a compromise would you worry what they want you think\nInstead of trying to get it Fifteen bucks an hour that they may be able to get it uh ten or twelve\nYeah but I think they would probably be more successful than going to Fifteen right away\nWith the midterms happening not only wrong federal areas and congressional here in the state of Florida a lot of seats up to play especially for the state Senate and the issue of education funding is coming out many of those in the state Senate seats\nAre talking about the Democrats are saying that the Republicans\nAfter a ranking shows that Florida is number forty fourth when it comes to state funding that the Republicans are not funding it enough and the Democrats are saying this is the reason why we need to raise taxes but Melissa France's from the Fox business these talks about how education taxes over so many years\nHave come up costs the taxpayer six hundred billion dollars in his that done enough money\nNumbers are staggering on six hundred and twenty three\nBillion dollars a year is what we all pay in state local and federal taxes to support the schools that comes out to former twelve thousand five hundred dollars per se and things like that are already overflowing with money I don't know the output bears out value\nAnd yet to some of them are talking about in certain counties about raising it happens the sales tax you knew they did it in clay county they've done to die in Indian River county they've done in Orlando they've done a lot of red districts as well and yet they say that there is not enough money going around but even those out there like Chris\nAnd yet they say that there is not enough money going around but even those out there like Chris ... as soon as the district facilities chief\nIn Hillsborough County says you know it's not exactly a hundred percent of the state's fault we have to also rely on that a lot of the capital projects come for local taxpayer dollars were a lot of the money has not been spent\nProperly in that area with that from Gary ... Fox News contributor he says you know education tax issues for public schools you think to up their game and\nI think of that [laughter] you know ... imagine that you don't want to buy some cars maybe the school is underperforming and you actually don't have to pay for it what that will do is make school start to compete\nWith the schools that are doing what which means they have to up their game which means education up up to the games which means our future up its game I Am absolutely\nBut you know when you talk about that about taxes he think okay if she should up everybody's gay but not the tax money properly spent which we know is not\nAnd then you get to meet education's always been a big issue charter schools are being thrown out of the bus schools or choice of being thrown under the bus those are the ... to keep the system the same um all we here's accountability Roger that gets old after a while I\nExactly you know you argue that you knew who gives you the best education I think a big factor ... people are taking their kids out of some of the public schools is because they're concerned about safety and the culture of the classroom is a crazy what's going on that's really probably a bigger deal than even the the the graves the kids are making\nMore as we continue to move along tripled you talked tripled to eight to ... talk radio W.

going to to to to to to find my email and mentally you know\nWe're going to get to your calls in just a brief moment on friday our friend Kevin dirty who's the editor for Florida daily dot com said that Roger normally the Republicans had a\nIt when it comes to mail by absentee right memory have male absentee early voting which pretty much is what I'm going to do and then the general election day because you and I will be busy that day\nThat normally is suffice is the Republicans where it shows that they have a good lead not anymore right now the Democrats are as far as I get asked me to translate into votes to Guillaume and what it means just that they're ahead as far as requests white out twenty five thousand\nThat's interesting you know I Wonder which means or in the league yeah ... that always makes me curious because the absentee ballots little different than voting early and of course definitely different than voting on election day these are people who want to vote by mail and you would think the Republicans tend to be probably a little bit more busy and maybe they have a business to run or whatever it may be\nBut Democrats asking for you know absentee ballots\nIt really does I mean but the numbers show when you look in the\nPrimaries even here in Jacksonville the majority of people voted on the day of election yeah\nBut I'm just saying when you look at that about a blue wave again Florida has about five hundred thousand more it's been this way consistently for the last several years has about five hundred thousand more voters of Democrats than Republicans they're up or by that twenty five thousand so is there a blue wave there's something blue going on\nLet's go to Randy Randy good morning or on WB it'll be\nGood morning Roger hey\nYeah hey we had a friend of a friend in a Mother's Day you're down to some butter registration changes over the hill and there was a big long line and so they started asking people what's going on or a big long time and they said there's a lot of people changing parties\nWhat's going on or a big long stretch there was a lot of people changing party dry matter really or some yeah some amount of my wife or some years ago when I was in manufacturing I changed parties because our our ... was a registered Democrat I didn't know the difference that young\nDidn't know one thing that I learned the principle of teaching them and to finish instead of giving a man a fish\nI actually picked up some ballots and took him to not work and put them on the table that gave me a little sign voting rights

they're registered but I just thought it'd be a help people register\nHey Randy let me ask you questions speaking about voter registration and maybe changing parties\nThat if you believe that the cabin all vote would've would he would have gotten denied\nBecause remember the Republicans were in charge not the Democrats do you feel this would have put a damper on Republicans a maybe they would have made me sad at the polls SUV sat at home to the polls in two thousand Eighteen or might even encourage some of them did just to sit back and say I believe that the Republican Party I'm going to become an independent what do you think\nNow I don't know personal opinion is I wouldn't I left the party over but I Do wish more of them would have supported Trump from the start and even now that

B. O. B.\nLet's get to it the elections now less than thirty days away does the GOP have an advantage GOP pollster Frank Luntz on a Twitter explains that in the past three mid term elections or the final results have skewed but right now in some polls the Republicans may be a far from the average poll are in favor\nBelieve it or not and some of these areas the question is what the month out Henry Olsen election analysts from the hill dot com says the Democrats may have a rough time of yes there is about the Brett Kavanaugh thing but also in the economic direction for blue collar worker for the\nPeople who ah turn the mid west from blue to red and these are the sort of people that the Democrats are having this intramural debate do we want to go back and try and engage with the white blue collar voter who just eight years ago was a loyal Democrats and make these sort of compromises bill gallstones\nArguing yes other people who are arguing no it's time to move the party to a different coalition\nTo these voters are not there are Trump voters Republican voters and I think that keen for both sides others to these groups are people who are not\nRed shirt type of people uh they used to like Hillary Clinton according to emily's study they did vote for Iraq about on they soured on the Democrats for real reasons but they're not sold on the Republican\nLet me let me ask this and and the reason why I I listen to a lot of there's a call that his radio show they're talking about we don't buy into the polls I think sometimes the polls are correct they were there were correct\nFor the most part and Congressman Ron dissenters when he defeated Adam put them yes I think one of the poll numbers had put them up by nine but the latest internal polls and other ones\nShowed a also the chamber of numbers show dissenters up by nine to Fifteen points look when he won by Haiti's truly is correct that none of the pollsters got an even close when it came to Andrew Gillum out there\nUm but here's a lot of things if there is a independent search and I don't know if there is or not\nBecause according to the numbers independence and millennials may not show up to the polls this year\nDo Republicans even here in Florida as of today remember we talked about there was about twenty five thousand lead for the Democrats as far as requests for absentee ballots yes and the first one to admit that does not automatically either going to vote straight Democrat but it does give some response of the Democrats do have something going on out\nThere yeah and I think the capital and an nomination did a lot for that I think it's going to draw a lot of people to the polls of course the midterms it's all about turnout usually it's low I think we're going to see a higher than average a turnout this ... this midterm election and I think it's probably going to swing in favor a more so than anticipated for the Republicans saw Roger said that\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty\nThe Naser forty eight [noise]\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\nHe is confirmed but yet is I already sat back and said I'm and this is nothing folks I mean I Am an extra dollars but no this is just my years of Roger by myself who've been journals for so many years well you see something take place then what is next\n... post mortem how do you like that is there a post mortem for the Democrats for the media which will get into in a moment\nOf how they may address this remember I kept saying as of last week Roger then again one of the other areas of the issues of the reason why cabinet or should not be confirmed now remember when I said last week that now they will come out and said that he should recused himself because he's quote tainted\nAnd some of the upcoming issues this was brought up by the wall Street Journal editorial report\nThat was an angry Brett Kavanaugh had last month Senate Judiciary committee hearing and as he prepares to take his seat on the Supreme Court this week critics are pointing to that performance to argue that cabinet lax judicial temperament they also claim that the political nature of his remarks will require that he recused himself from certain the high court cases going for a while isn't\nThat interesting from Ireland Shapiro who is with the Kato Institute Supreme Court review he says I think Kevin off temperament is pretty much fine and when you're not being attacked\nPaid him a different jobs and it was before I'm Brett Kavanaugh I mean he seems very well adjusted uh\nThere's a difference between judicial temperament a when you've been accused of gang rape and all the rest of it versus uh twelve years on the bench and glowing reviews or you know I've seen him in person how he acts as a judge and no complaints that\nNo complaints you know Roger we talked about a post mortem evidently the left says they're not going to stop Cory Booker over the weekend knew joys the senator says that hey if they would both houses of Congress they will look to impeach cabinet remember ABC's news George Stephanopoulos asked is a\nCongressman Jerry ... is is on the table if the Democrats win\nIn Russia want to pick up on Wednesday personally plus he was saying All right there are a lot of Democrats has said that they don't believe that Brett Kavanaugh told the truth when he went before the Judiciary Committee said if it turns out that he does become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the ... community would you investigated for possible impeachment\nUm things in ruin things including perjury this has got to be thoroughly investigated the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court and and the Senate haven't investigated than anything else will have to\nInvestigate we wouldn't have to investigate any credible allegation certainly of perjury and other things that haven't been properly looked into before\nQuestion um who do they ask for the investigation is it the investigator's murder then asked the FBI and do a thorough investigation again\nYou ask Donald Trump to some of the one thing I've learned to add is whoever is not in power regardless of beside that particular loses their ever loving mines and the crazy ended up driving people to the other side\nJonathan Turley George Washington university law professor says you just can't keep having do overs when you lose\n... so is sure you could have a trial for the dead if you want it or they confirmed that funny but it is a dreadful idea I think the framers created this process have some finality now the Democrats\nAll white there's understand as a two part question why one of my kids attend a private school and that's another valley question to question number one\nIf you don't have any kids that are ten the private schools or public school system at all should they be forced to pay taxes that's called the number one number two if you're a parent single or married or whatever and your kids attend a private school should you still be forced to pay property taxes\nFor public schools or number three should you just should you have the cafeteria of items if you're going to be forced to pay property taxes you have the choice of what your money should go to ...\nWant to hear from you this is a very valid point of both sides had triple to talk triple to eight to five five Gary ... who was a Fox News contributor says you know forcing the public schools up their game with the education taxes would do the\nJob and I think of that [laughter] you know ... imagine that you don't want to buy some clothes maybe the school is underperforming and you actually don't have\nTo pay for and what that will do is make school start to compete with the schools that are doing well which means they have to up their game which means education that upsets games which means our future up to a game I Am absolutely\nSo here's the question we are now thirty days away many of you will be voting locally here for state reps in states centers I Love to hear from you if education is an issue\nAnd let's say again the issue that way and of course folks they always say we never have enough money we never have enough money clay county said that every I mean it looks speech was beyond us a lot of money you throw the local community after what Tallahassee\nDoes and it's unfortunate that you have to pick up the tab\nBut if you have new kids in the public school system she's used to be forced to pay property taxes and or if your kids go to a private schools should be forced to pay property taxes or should we just do it because it as a betterment for that young individual go to those schools want to hear from you tripled to talk\nTripled to eight to five five because the phone just go to Pam Hi Pam good morning you're WB obey\nHey good morning and I'd love to weigh in on that please do\nFull time I was on the St John Kennedy scoreboard and what I found that there are so many regulations that costs so much flying that have nothing to do with the classrooms\nPencil paper do you know computer whatever it is and I think I can do what Trump is sounding the regulation it would help a lot and have a heater claims tale she has what they have to spend so much money on his regulations so you need more money for public instead of the charts don't have to date the regulation I mean regulation and we had an even\nPlaying field and if we hadn't salary follow that child what ever they want a kid I think that would be the fairest and get it and yes everybody probably need to pay for education because education is important to the entire day but I think choice and education for weight that he's gay regulated and\nEven the playing field on what cost what so that's a cost ...\nPay a quick question deregulation of the state for the audience I kinda knew what the answer is but for the listener out there does the majority that come from your local school board has come from Tallahassee\nCallahan there you go into federal for hours on the phone where we had to send a thousand I think uh seven thousand dollars a door to redo all the handle in case somebody didn't have any arms SATs\nRide all pan out I could spend an hour or what you just said I was curious as to what these expenses that they'll be able to get to the Americans with Disabilities Act which is one of the worst walls every implement it back in Nineteen Ninety One that was signed by a Republican George W. Bush\nWere they forced the local schools to comply with federal regulations so let's say that ... cording to federal regulations would cost\nI'm given a hypothetical sixty thousand the local school board says well we can do it for thirty thousand doesn't matter you have to do with the federal regulation\nUs exactly right you would think to Washington DC is requiring something more should be able to pay for well\nRoger now you're talking logistics here and they do is go back to the phones just go to Wayne Wayne good morning you're on WB Yogi\nWarning hey that and if you don't pay I yeah I my kids are graduated whatever the point is if you're not paying property tax\nFor schools you're going to pay for prisons it's that simple Marjorie okay I'm going to say but you don't pay taxes going to pay for president sets it\nI mean if you're not educated in some way or form whether it be boat Packer you know going on to\nCollege uh what else you got to turn to crime and make money I wouldn't use that all the other\nOne way or another we're paying for infrastructure would rather\nBe written fell yeah that's a great one way and I would oppose that that is a great point I Want to pose that question out to you listening to talk to plug going to pay for infrastructure in one way or the other and that's a great line James's we either pay the taxes for kids to be educated\nWell guess what we're going to pay for presidents\nThe taxes for kids to be educated or guess what we're going to pay for presidents\nThat's kind of an interesting take on it I mean that is a great point I Love the follow up\nOn this morning at there'll be a little ninth grader or a boy or girl sitting in class one day will become a doctor who will be saving someone's life listening right now and that they could investigate education is important or maybe they won't say their lives maybe maybe not but you know I can put rocket really based on assumptions out having an educated society I think it's important for everyone\nDo I base it on the substance out there that's what I'm asking do I treat education like the market the market's doing well I Would assume again may do well five years down the road right that's a little tricky let's go to James James good morning or W. B. O. B.\nR. Mr dean very simple question\nIt going to be challenged being forced to join a political party being challenged or be join a union\nBeing forced to join this organization be forced to support something you don't believe that or being forced to support something when you don't have anybody here that's going to go back to go you're paying ... pack\nOr something or not you know you're going to have all kinds of Pandora box is opening up and I think people over or your father do after\nThey shouldn't have a I mean they and their life\nSomebody else to step up I'm In and do their shirt and on top of that people that rent they don't pay property taxes oh yeah okay the landlord ... but give me a break you know what I'm saying you got\nOkay I got a little while that seat but here's the point the renters will do indirectly pay that tax because again business is not in the business of losing business I got news for your rent ... the business of losing money they will pass that cost on\nSo but fifty five but older okay that that could be valid excuse I mean a ballad aren't going to say excuse I don't know about that that's kind of interesting out there but I'm the questions you already paying it that's interesting takes out Jeff good morning you're on\nWB obey hey I got to do it hey good morning to me that\nThe whole issue of school funding is almost like foreign aid for a dictator\nLike the previous caller said it turn of the money gets where whites right so we can send billions of dollars overseas to some dictator and what are we end up with people stay or in the dictators built the bigger mansion\nAnd to me the school system is similar to that it's so over regulated and so all bloated stop the money to never make it down to the kid or the teacher yeah wherever bodies always mad about how much money is spent they don't see anything in the ...\nAnd I believe that's why it's it's all administrative overhead regulation and pretty much worthless stuff\nI've let me let me ask you a quick question even and I mean I Am in total agreement with it I mean these schools are too big to fail they're mostly now for hurricane shelters even if you cut back the regulation and I totally agree there's thousands of dollars even to the millions I still think as you just kind of put it out I still think the school system unfortunately would decry we don't have enough money\n\nUsually yeah because areas are growing like she was talking about state Johns county everyone's going there because of the school but the teachers are going there are reasons and that's what I Would be interested to find out they're not necessarily pay more but there's something there that makes them want to be there\nYeah I mean this was that's a good debate on that as well more as we continue to move along talk radio WB obey\nIf you're allowed to be five on the east beltway plan on slow down says you get to the un of towns that are eggs with this

Vikings David Williams who is the president of the taxpayers protected alliance protecting taxpayers that or I couldn't resist a good year mean man\nIt I'm I'm a man or and also he is a a Fox Business news contributor so our good buddy ed legit comes on his radio show just tweeted out he's a commentator for the Florida radio network he says quote\nI hate to break into all the more on the Supreme Court justice cannot be impeached for something that did not occur while he was on the bench little load allegedly Thirty years ago is that correct\nIt is and let's take us to another level let's say the Democrats do take back the house in November and this is what they do is they come and they start doing all these investigations they tried to impeach cabin all you know what this means means Trump is going to be reelected and twenty twenty because they're going to do a lot of nonsense that people just don't want them to do\nThey're not going to get anything done if this is what they did so it's a real risk for the Democrats and winning the house\nThat they are going to accomplish nothing and two years and remind people why Trump should be president\nHey listen to rush through a bunch of issues as you're out of Washington DC by the way the taxpayers protection lines which is a nonpartisan group focuses on\nTaxpayers are advocacy when it comes a lot of issues what does the word on the Mueller investigation I knew that a few other according to some of the reports I think by the Washington Post the view of the judge and that scares me lawyers have kind of stepped away that some people think that this is narrowing down what do you hear about that\n[noise] nothing I mean there's a lot of just the inside baseball things happening now where\nThere's money you know campaign document campaign money but just a investments before Trump was even a candidate though the Mueller thing and the word collusion is not being used anymore and I think that's where the fast and they were almost two years into this war about Eighteen or Nineteen months into this and\nThere's no collusion and there's no not even aware of clues and coming up Mueller so I think this is a a interesting that the lack of what we're hearing and we have attorneys that are leaving you have these attorneys that are leaving the prosecutor's office and said this is a nothing happened man\nGOP pollster Frank Luntz tweeted on Monday that job to ... some of the generic polls they weren't specific care that they have an advantage going into this right now is a great week for President Trump does did you still have an advantage I mean Democrats still ticked off what do you see this going with the next thirty days\nNow this is funny because I thought tax reform was going to be the big issue for voters in November I was wrong it's Kavanaugh\nAnd it's what the Democrats are doing and try to do against Kavanaugh because this is getting the base energize I think people are just sort of complaints and like the economy's chugging along we have low employment you know more money and pay checks and I think people are just kind of complacent\nOh we have little unemployment and more money and pay checks\nAnd I think people are just kind of complacent put this Kevin offing really lit a fire under a lot of Republicans and we're seeing them\nNow going back to the polls in early voting has already started so they're there and the Republicans are there now and they will be there until November ... listen to the Senate is looking amazing for the Republicans right now because we have a high camp who is pretty much eleven or twelve points down in her senatorial reelection bits of the Republicans were going to\nGet a a seat there but the house you know who knows what the how to do\nBy the way as news to dominance I told everybody to gyms they figured there we're going to lose in these red states there we're going to vote no on cabinet figure they're going to lose\nRight and hike it had nothing to lose and listen to Senator McCaskill she in from Missouri she's in a really tight race we're talking about a two or three point race\nUh they're against Holly and this cabinet thing may push her out I mean because that's how close it is is that Missouri is a very conservative state it's a very red state and she's a Democrat and yeah she's won in the past but\nBut you know what if he does not bode well David ... I mean and and I there was a lot of the issues I think a lot of people are probably getting some would proceed with the cabinet thing but the lizard this radio show the majority of ... Ninety five percent of the women\nThat called up says you know what this is nothing I mean women do lie ahead this is nothing but a hit job blah blah blah blah blah I'm seeing a lot of people say listen I normally vote for Democrats but\nIf I didn't support Christine Ford's accusations of somehow now I'm a racism anti woman I think that's too awful lot of people\nWhile and it's hypocrisy look at these women that are screaming at Kavanaugh yet Bill Clinton is fine Anthony wiener is fine I mean Anthony wiener tried to have sex with an underage girl and yet the me too movement seems to have forgotten that\nThe me too movement has gotten a Bill Clinton and what he did back in the nineties 'cause they have selective memories\nWho is a ... if you had the new tore us R D G Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd everybody keeps thinking what does she need for eighty five if uh if ... if she didn't make that announcement was about five months ago that she plans to stay on\nUm this was going to be a big issue about Supreme Court nominee but is there a rumor going around that just just prior may try to step down before or be G and are they going to try to wait till after the two thousand and Tony elections the Trump does get another swat goodness\nVice president Mike Pence on Saturday after Kavanaugh was confirming yet is I brought up last week what would be the other avenue that liberals want go after cabin all the Cory Booker in some of those have said that they will try to impeach them but yet they teach them on what\nYou have to teach him on something that maybe he did as a justice of the appeals court but the question for the wall Street Journal editorial report says now liberals will maybe try to look at him to Capitol they'd have to recuse himself because he was open on some of these issues [noise]\nThat was an angry Brett Kavanaugh had last month's Senate Judiciary committee hearing and as he prepares to take his seat on the Supreme Court this week critics are pointing to that performance to argue that Kavanaugh lax judicial temperament they also claimed that the political nature of his remarks will require that he recused himself from certain the high court cases going for\nYou know Roger I I've said this before you and I have covered court cases or ... you ever seen somebody go in front of a judge\nIn fact you just go on TV and watch it um it'd be a smart alec in front of the judges judge probably would have gone down their way and their decision but it was such so rude to the individual I mean the individuals route to the judge they sat back and said nope I'm and which they have every right to do that the judge can sit back and say I'm not going to ruin your favor\nI just can't I mean I could imagine but I mean if you're smart\nWhy would you want to go in front of if you believe this is going to be five four decision right and Kavanaugh is that flip vote as they always proclaiming debate when they said that he should not be confirmed\nWhy would you want to go in that courtroom and take him off by saying judge counties you're recused herself others pro union case of this pro choice abortion case whatever why would you want to do that knowing that taking them off he may rule against\nYou know what I get the sense still debris Kevin O's above that and he could probably a look at a fairly big issues and not let his emotions weigh in on who's decisions as naive [laughter] the the a with the I\nDon't really buy or he's above all that I Believe he was above all they let me play devil's advocate with why did he come out in as they say you really go after the the Senate Democrats and the Judiciary Committee which he apologized for doing the ... if he was above all that did why did he come out and show that he was kicked off\nSo you do the under attack for days people were accusing them of things that he says he had no of involving ... you think that if somebody doesn't like the judge one way or the other ... and they go in and say judge you need to recuse yourself Bob what do you think he's going to take a higher road impossibly rolling their fame I don't think it's a difference\nBetween asking to recuse yourself because that happens all the time of judges\nVersus being really orderly I really you see all that go to the Supreme Court asked the judge to recuse themselves um I'm not aware of any Supreme Court cases where judges have recused himself with or being asked\nTo recuse the other little course absolutely it happens a lot now that's different than showing up in the courtroom and and you know using profanity way way way way way way your kitchen\nDifferent than showing up in the courtroom and and you know using profanity way way way way way could tempt of\nCourse some of the lower court sort of or a three percent individuals' why would you even want to your numbers are limited why would you leave in front of you in front of a judge and ask them to recuse himself asking\nA judge to recuse yourself which I don't think they should do first of all but I don't believe that way and to do their decision because it's a common rarely not contempt of court I think what you would you say you're just job back though is when you have contempt of court that's when you get\nThe book one of these shows that it could tip the court if you ask them recused themselves in a rude way I don't believe that's contempt of court you don't think so in a runway yeah but I don't know what I'm saying the judge wouldn't put your contempt of court and having said that by the justice asking to recuse himself because you don't agree to political ideology you think the judge is going to be above that\nHow many judges have we seen back it sit back even a traffic or say\nOr what do you smell it what are you wearing today well how come you're just respected me by the way you dress I've seen that plenty of times\n[noise] would that be a contempt\nThing or to that as you can tell where he's going to find the right but I I think that really has to do what you know a matter of which which typical practice MBA law and if someone asked the judge to recuse themselves they don't let that way you do if they get upset but when there's contempt at the ... and\nIf you don't think the judge gets a way you don't believe the judge us cover them in all cases like I don't have a judge gets offended when you ask here she recused\nHim so I don't believe that would change their decisions and then in their practice on the court is I Would hope not I would hope it would be\nSo if the if if your route to a judge on the local level by far as hey judge um I don't think that that will just come on it was just a driver's license suspension or one of that and the judge tells you you were rude to him or her I mean you know plenty of times in court cases in civil court cases where the judge will you wouldn't shut up\nThe judge just says you know what I was going to favor the alter your case out\nYeah well that that may be more of a contempt thing than it did it did have to be tempting to judge maybe find you just may not want to find you yeah finds you but find you get what I'm saying that by India by any one of the biggest\nCases that could be coming up in front of the Supreme Court that a lot of conservatives may want to take a look at according to I was ... Institute isn't roe versus Wade isn't even about the issue of guns are\nThe biggest one I think that will or has the potential changing is affirmative action and racial preferences a trial starts in two weeks in Boston a lawsuit against a Harvard University if and when that gets up in the Supreme Court in two years or so that could be a big change in this forty year old experiment with he was a racial preferences\nOr other things made any ... waiter abortion gets talked about but remember John Roberts is the middle of the court the team's chances we haven't had achieved justice in the middle of the corn jurors potentially in quite some time since the thirties I think and so things like that will only go as far as fast as he wants to take\n... affirmative action could be a big issue tripled you talk tripled to eight to five five twenty five minutes after eight am on TALK radio W POV\n... five south at St Augustine rogue who's a crash involving at least three cars Ninety five south of the Martin Luther King park where you actually look out for records on the right and if you're an eye to the U.S thrill one you'll be slow down their due to a broken down car\nMy name is James and I'm In the bill is program at the restaurant I grew up in foster care system and I realized I had a person even as a kid I thought once I was adopted my question would go away but even after I was adopted\nA sixteen I was still struggling with depression is going to church to my life started falling apart I found myself homeless and eating healthy I Try to other shelters but they didn't feel right for me when I got to the rescue mission\nFelt like it was where God wanted me to be since I've been in the program I've read the Bible more than I have in my entire life from closer to God and he showed me a lot better perspective on life now and I hope for future and learn you can make your own family and I feel like I have found a family here at zero\nNinety Nikki that executive director for the rescue mission would you consider helping us make a difference as we provide\nHealing and change to those who need it most of the Iran Jay ecstatic that the Iranian jak to learn more for to make a donation to help pay for the lives of the hungry and they did it in northeast Florida\nWe're expecting lots of rain with thunderstorms today the ... will be eighty four degrees this evening more rain and thunderstorms expected Seventy seven low right now due to Seventy eight theory W.

starts at six five thirty is kind of a meat and great and then seven PM is there a reception my coke is going to be there\nThis is going to be a good time to find out what your candidate stance on state local and federal issues a lot of state races a lot of Senate races\nOne of the big issues is about education\nThere is a big story this just come out over the weekend are profiting from one of the Tampa Bay publications were Democrats are attacking Republicans for not spending enough money on the issue of education Florida Florida rinks forty fourth among the states in education funding\nThey say that because of it adequate funding they that they no longer can afford or replace local air conditions we need to have a more sales tax to fix the aging buildings out there but Melissa Francis from the Fox business news says look it up all the billions upon billions of money we spent on education whereas it got\nNumbers are staggering on hunger twinkle three billion dollars a year is what we all pay in state local and federal tax increase support the schools that comes out to foreigners twelve thousand five hundred dollars per se it\nSeems like they're already overflowing with money I don't know the output bears out value but\nGerry will is also a correspondent for the business news says that even if you don't have any kids in the district you should still pay taxes because you're still part of the community not\nGoing to pay for it from the heart of the community and got a kitten money and you have a faith or even if\nHow to take and making education better is education now luckily I have not really right I think it's got to be taking money away and say we're not going to support it at all isn't the answer and you know here's a\nQuestion I'd like to ask it I've been asking us if you have new kids in a public school system she used to be forced to pay property taxes second question if your kids attend a private school should you still be forced to pay property taxes for kids you don't have it a public school education system\nAnd number three should you have\nParticipation should she be mandated enforced no kids you have grandchildren you do not attend to public school system\nShould still be forced to pay property taxes as Tyler says either we all pay for the school system or we pay for more prisons what do you think about that I Love to hear from you should you have to pay property taxes even if you don't have any kids attending the public school system\nWhat do you think nine zero for triple to eight to five five this is talk radio WBFO be [noise]\nAgain you know I Wish I Would have had a back on it you know what let me ask you this question alley [laughter] and I know she's not there but why is it\nThat public schools do not have the same restrict job I mean\nYou always want to put the same restrictions from private from public schools are charter schools which are schools are doing better but yet should we closed down charter schools misappropriation of money yes she will be closing down be some disciplinary action to yes should be closed another direct grades yes tell me are the ratio of all the public schools that are closing down because of everything I just mentioned\n... not ...\n... according to the school offered more money they get more thank you they get more money oh by the way they stay open because why they are too big\nTo fail\nYou only want to pick it up let's go to John John good morning you're on WB you'll be what's happening\nThere would listen this is a cultural failure it's a family failure your child's not do it in school you can go to free library they have special programs for children all day long on the weekends you know the father the father is you know family\nHas a lot to do with kids failing in school or Jane's and hands on road and deer sociological scientific research one of the reasons why or Asia addict families in Jewish families are so successful and this is the fact the family unit stays together ...\nIt's that simple now you include fraud corruption you know ... class size because of illegal immigration this is what leftist policies\nHave done to the United states you know you took away corporal punishment Ansari some kids need to be spanked some family members out here the worst parents in the world you can't even have a driver's license let alone a kid [noise]\nWhy you're telling you you took away you took away the social structure and this is pure wet with as far as property taxes yeah I think you should have a reduction of property taxes if you don't have children absolutely but your property taxes also pay for firemen so forth and so on other social networks\nAll correct and I I'm not disagreeing with that but you have a certain portion that goes to pay for fire and police and then you have another portion that goes to pay for school taxes so I didn't say eliminate all the property tax I'm Talking about your school property tax was going to Deborah Deborah good morning\nOn WB obey\nThe previous callers they were great yeah they were after all the great thank you um but as for me I don't have any children and that's one reason why it's important uh school vouchers number two\nAnd number two I think that you have to look what's going on in the school bus system as well and some of these kids are staying until they're Twenty one because of the special laws that have been passed [laughter]\nSo I Know up in Massachusetts they said it was almost a tired day on one a child that they're having problems with and you'll have Twenty one people that are in a in a meeting all day long for how much is the time is being directed to take care of the problem kids\nYou know as well here's an here's an interesting question I like to ask\nTo Eli and I'm not picking on her belly made some valid points I ... I mean she came out with what was what she thought it was a lot of the statistics and I find I like people to get to the point I appreciate the call\nBut when I look at remedial courses had me on order meter courses as all I can learn some of the basics the numbers have not changed folks for Twenty years I'm telling you as a former education reporter and never I used to be very moderate to liberal the economy certainly ... private schools and there's a report I became a little bit more conservative on these issues\nOver twenty plus years fifty to sixty percent of those that go to a local college have to take remedial courses why is that that's all that's why I'm asking a rhetorical you why does that\nCompare it to those in the charter schools and the private schools I think it has to do with parental involvement I think a mom or dad or writing a check out they care a lot more about this is the norm okay\nLet's say you're right ignore the parental involvement okay talk about what's going on at our schools I'm not even so the teacher on the bus it can be a whole host of things out there you know\nWhat to do is out there to support more money going to public schools and public schools in public schools advocate why more money is the answer again you look at the for the department of education so numbers the schools are getting more you didn't have all been more money per teacher more money per classroom and all the big blue areas\nActually do less but only if you're caught rural areas they get less money per teacher less money per money involved with the teacher and less of the union and why do they do\nBetter I'm I'm just asking tripled you talked triple to eight to five five Jason good morning on WB obey\n... Roger certainly some lively conversation this morning I Hope so [laughter] so my family and I moved from Atlanta where Georgia is currently in a struggle to the bottom of the barrel\nBut we home school our children's ever since they were old enough to be in any type of public education system\nAnd it had no problems ever paying taxes for you know the other children are going to public schools I think the one element listening for that is wild tracks or should we should have a little bit of say so as to where those tax dollars goes through the school voucher system so that those schools that are feeling people have the ability to take their money away\nAnd put it into an educational system going to benefit their children rather than being locked into a place where they have no choice\nThat's very interesting point Jason I went to public school in ...\nA place where they have no choice\nThat's a very interesting point Jason I went to public school in private school and you know that we had a lot of black kids go to the private school may tell yourself that that a lot of them were also funded by those as silent donors\nIn the black kids the problem no they were not usually the white kids that what the problem the right the ... the white rich kids that what the problem\nAnd they're like yeah I I I mean by the way chasing a ... Atlanta in Jacksonville have a very if I'm not what part of Georgia are you from\nWe were from Atlanta just on the west\nSide of what my my the people I I I Wish I were um relate to the people now for ... cater yeah al Pataki yes\nYep fenced off your horse but with Jason what I'm getting at is that um ... ... ... when you look at that at the private school public late late and jak why the huge huge those in the black community or the lotteries just to send their kids to a private school in charter schools\nAbsolutely and it benefits those children because they're able to get a better education without having to be in such large classroom environment being able to get a little bit more a specialized whenever they have similar immediately shoes they need to resolve\nUp but the important thing is those children are able to get an education and not be distracted by tiger you just the other thing so I I think it always beneficial children will get a specialized education whether it's private education whether it's ... whether it's their families like my children have benefited from my wife and I ... for your these past twelve years\nDo you let them take schooling or are they also home schooled\nMy children are home schooled\nAlright die but I appreciate the call and I just brush it I mean just I I I by the way even those that have vouchers go to these schools should pay something into the system\nMember boundaries and there were only about ... was not to tend to pay four dollars to help pay for a supplement supplement and by the way charter schools and some have you been emailing me this morning aren't fully funded they still have to raise money for field trips that we have to do that in the public school system as well\nIt's a great topic we're going to answer more you're not answer you guys will make the questions I'll make questions you guys make the answer more of your calls coming up next on TALK radio W.
