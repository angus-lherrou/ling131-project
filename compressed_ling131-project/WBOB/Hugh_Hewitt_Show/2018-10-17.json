V. O. B.\nHere on the top stories were bringing you this morning CNN says the voting rights and voter suppression for twenty Eighteen mid term elections is being caused by Republicans early estimate show hurricane Michael could cost around ten to twelve billion dollars in damages\nAnd the Supreme Court agrees to hear a case that could determine whether Facebook Twitter and other social media companies can censor their users to\nContact and be damaging some one on one woman who called two two two\nTo five ... ... email and then you'll be good\nWednesday morning Howard Dean Roger Henderson and we are set and ready to go we got a lot of news to cover today that a lot of it has to deal with your back pocket and the election Mitt terms\nSo let's get on with the show CNN says that Republicans here in the state of Florida and throughout the rest of the country are causing are you ready for this bitter suppression and denying the voting rights clip number three CNN's John ... says here's where they're causing it to\nUnder the guise of protecting election integrity and who wouldn't want that Republicans in several states are knocking hundreds of thousands of people off the voter rolls\nIn Georgia nearly six hundred thousand people purge during one weekend in July but then additional fifty three thousand applications left in limbo in Indiana nearly five hundred thousand threatened with being knocked out voter rolls and Ohio I use it or lose at law for failure to vote and two consecutive elections may cause you to lose your registration\nIn swing states North Carolina and Florida attempts to roll back early voting and then nine deep red state thousands of polling places shuttered over the last five years this proportionately affecting poor and minority communities and in North Dakota voter ID laws that condition franchise thousands of Native Americans had about race but couldn't confirm determines control the Senate\nCritics say this isn't about integrity it's about winning elections by any means necessary\nAnd have you noticed that there isn't any problem in the white community says always the minority community North Dakota it's Native Americans here in Florida says and the black community um again we will just do it we will divulge all does miss that you just heard here\nAnd just a few moments even Jamal walking on the N. double ACP says that the current voting system put out there by the Republicans he says\nDiscourages people from wanting to participate in voting\nWe find that you know say a mother for who's going to work and have to travel past four or five polling places\nAnd she has to go through all these sort of hoops and ladders in order to actually cast their ballot when in fact she's a hardworking American until we start to look at the way and with the laws are constructed it's not designed for participation is designed to create barriers and we're seeing is that when laws like\nPhoto ID start to get past and when you start to the polling places in terms of you know early vote our being curtail the data shows actually limit\nParticipation water we want to do that in a country that values and prides itself on democracy and on for participation so for us we're really arguing that approach voters and there has to be the way to go\nThere is such a problem have you ever heard vote by mail I mean that does exist have you noticed that the and I'm not saying this as a protection I mean it's still looks like the Democrats according to the polls that they show up and vote or going to do quite well and the next several weeks for the next few weeks but if I'm reading too much into this\nIt sounds like if the dams don't pick up any seats where the money's what they projected they could just blame it to get on the Republicans in butter suppression\nThey can they can do that especially of a big media outlet like CNN which is really good with CBS saying that this was going on you know what I always take the position to avoid even the appearance of impropriety if it looks like it's bad then maybe look for ways to try to protect leaving the look that way you're going to\nGo to qualify you made it because it's a crime scene here you don't want to buy and gun just in case you may have to use it ... well again why is it that we always look for the good news in ... when I sit back and say you have to earn my goodness are\nThese new requirements that they're being pushed or these are things in the last\nI mean listen let's go back again when governor Rick Scott came into office in two thousand tag along with attorney general Pam Bondi\nTo get rid of dead people that no longer voted to get rid of them off the voter rolls haven't has that been done for decades decades have been not well not now now if that's the case and look at what happened up in Chicago Nineteen sixty what I'm getting at\nIs that they got rid of all the purge that is what they said ... the Democrats were up in arms guess who expected more Republicans more Republicans got kicked off the voter rolls because they found out that their ineligible living here anymore right\nWhere it you know what it was all the money one of the biggest complaints ... goes on is that\nYou need to have photo ID to vote and that's like any reasonable person thinks that's probably fair to do the complaint that a lot of people have they can't afford to get their driver's license renewed in some areas and they just catch the bus instead of a of the you know automatically deposited for their for their payroll how ... will be so difficult to have the supervisors were elections offices issued their own\nPicture ID and maybe tax some of the campaign superPACs so that might be or\nThat might be the right way to go back to cover everyone will you do know that they do offer motor voters at the driver's license so that your idea is still valid there as well but you kind of bring up an interesting point but they've already got an idea why would they need another idea\nWell some people say they don't have an idea and that's why they don't have\nThat how do they get around then who doesn't have an ID\nOr some people I Believe especially some of the major metropolitan areas that have really good public transportation they don't need a driver's license\nYou're at but they have to have an idea to buy things go to the bank and things like\nThat our days people have direct deposit they may have opened their bank account ten years ago but they didn't get a renewed but you still have to have an idea for that back when you had it yeah maybe it was cheaper back then but now they have ... have an ID now because maybe it expire and they didn't pay a hundred dollars to renew because it's more expensive now to get every news\nYou can still get a state id for almost free why didn't know the cost of yeah that was some cases that they do they do allow it the Supreme Court all wow Roger this has been a big issue on this radio show it has blown up\nThe phone calls from individuals on both sides the issue of dealing about regulating social media around censorship you know this you've covered this as well the Supreme Court this past week has agreed to hear a case that could determine\nWhether Facebook Twitter and other social media companies can censor\nUsers they've agreed to determine whether or not social media's can challenge this all on the main issue course of the freedom of speech remember what President Trump recently said about how we cannot tolerate political censorship when it comes to social media\nGoogle Facebook Twitter\nSocial media\nYou look at Google Facebook Twitter\nSocial media and I we can't change cannot tolerate\nCensorship\n\nTrying to\nRemember the president also recently just said that groups like Google and Twitter all these individuals are taking advantage of people\nReally think it is a lot of people and I think that's a very serious thing and it's a very serious\nCharge I think ... are doing if you look at what's going on it if you look at what's going on and face they better be careful because here you can't do that and people we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in\nI you know if you want in my opinion of course it doesn't matter to listeners but I think\nYou know yours there's wind I I think it has to do a whole lot with the free market because even if they thought Hillary is going to win and I think everyone did with the exception of just a few people um it was it didn't really take effect we didn't see all these major things going on consumer optimism until Trump took office\nAnd that's when they started talking about a thousand dollar bonuses increasing the minimum wage to work for certain companies\nFox Business news reporter Elizabeth McDonald says you know they're always want to use New York as a poster child and it's killing minimize the minimum wage is killing jumps in New York she reported\nThat fear on one side they say raising minimum wage it helps people and help their families and the business side they're saying now it costs jobs now this New York city restaurants or at a tipping point that restaurant owners and pushing lawmakers in New York City\nTo let them add up to five percent surcharge an extra taxes on restaurant customers\nNow did you hear that that in order to pay for the minimum wage the local government even the some of the states want to put a local surcharge on your food T. now Andrew Gillum has\nSaid we're going to have this discussion with the vice president of policy from ah the James Madison Institute sound news on the tax policies\nThat Andrew Gillum says that he wants to help subsidize companies that have to pay for the hike in the minimum wage the question is is during the exemptions Roger he's he's talking about every company is going to have to pay the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage\nThe question is if we're going to pay for these do you think here in many minutes of ... he's in Florida that in order to pay for this this might have to be the right way to go you know I mean for example the governor comes and says hey we're going to increase spending will get you get it has to take care of that bill the local school system local taxpayer\nIf minimum wages high dumb to Fifteen bucks an hour hypothetical here in Florida ... the cities have to pay for that could you be paying more at the uh the dinner table\nAnd and and what do you end up curtailing people's willingness to go out to where the money you know the the hamburgers and costs two dollars there's no more dollar Ninety nine so you're not going out is six Ninety nine menu\nMika Brzezinski Morning Joe Joe Scarborough say that with a lizard bits Warren pocket on releasing her DNA where she is one tenth of tense up a tenth of a chance of tens of thousands or whatever that she is American native she is a ancestry or from the Cherokee\nHum Mika Brzezinski says you know what the ... you guys see the the the touchdown right she says Dems need to stay on message she says Dems are actually getting off\nThe craft his last days talking about bill and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren plans for twenty twenty [noise]\nAre they saying nothing stays ahead of critical terms yes they are guys and they will guys putting today to south twenty two days later from Hillary right now and talk about [noise]\n... they had a dog that they have and when she was taken advantage of an avenue\nFor the elections and a lot of what to think of it that will come out for me is not like a democratic friends\nGo down okay go to the phone banks say away from blenders in your kitchen call of democratic voters don't hurt because\nHe sounds like one of the cell evangelist go your phone's right now go to your phone's right now I mean here's the question how do you honestly believe that people in the midterms are going to have a recollection of something happened Twenty years ago this year with Monica Lewinsky Elizabeth Warren on an issue here in the state of ... I don't know if I buy into that\nWell you know they're talking about the you know the news real estate but the ... the news channels are talking about and that can take away from some of the things they write the Democrats but you know you really can't blame Hillary Clinton she was asked point blank by a reporter once you're supposed to talk about the economy instead of whether or not Monica Lewinsky was a factor or not\nWell you got to admit it is quite interesting that she says no it wasn't an abuse of power job listings not an all time high more jobless things and there are people looking for work Rick send tally from CNBC and Blakely advisor CIO Peter boot for\nHenry rain this year I thought that was good and the revised last month to seven million\nToday's number was even higher poison is unreal job openings any thoughts labor markets solid delivered just shifting to employees\nPlanes any thoughts that labor markets solid the leverage is shifting to employees as evidenced by this huge demand for labor the lack of supply and we're paying higher wages I think\nThe higher wages not from the government but then again from the free market which brings us into another conversation here Roger is a big discussion here in Florida ... about expanding Medicaid is there any type of work requirements with all the economy the way things are doing well Stewart volley ask book author Peter ... from the book\nPoor no more work requirements for those on state run Medicaid\nPosed just suppose hypothetical\nOf three children you gotta stay home to take care of those kids and you are single mothers single parent you get Medicaid would you be kicked off because you can go get a job when you've got three kids at home as long as\nDaycares available and daycare generally is available so daycare is available should be able to go to work that is what we did in Nineteen eighty Ninety six and that's why the rules went down and people went to war and no one went starving\nAnd welfare state run medicate star Parker the center for urban renewal and education says yeah we need to have requirements to come to work for those in Florida if Andrew Gillum gets to become governor and expand his medicate\nTake advantage of this new opportunity\nThat try to see if we can include work and training and other mechanisms so that people will move from sitting on their couch\nAs they're getting their Medicaid and maybe start getting more involved and participate in in their own lives and in our society where\nThe real issue on hand you're absolutely right out of that well for what Thirty years ago and nothing has changed since then we're able to just do whatever you want to do there's little requirement for people to get back into society there's not a requirement for the folks that are\nSitting there taking advantage of somebody else's work so this is a good move to start getting much more creative about how we distribute a anti poverty money's tax money to the states for them to help them\nIn Roger I mean the argument has\nTo be made it the economy's doing so well why do people need to become more on the roles of Medicaid and on welfare I mean the numbers are slightly drop it of runners but then again she may not be majority drop and been talking with things\nAre more you talk about Medicare for all and the expanding it I Believe that's going to encourage people already have but I think a lot of that but this was ... yeah yeah they are making them work and may be a good idea you know I Do have a heart for the single moms who have a toddler at home you know having to drop the kid off its it's expensive to send your kid to the child care\nIt may even be more expensive than actually paying for regular insurance policy\nActually have some some stake on like uh did you get America and all that kind of stuff out there and so more as we continue to move along talk radio WB obey\nMuch five south the Brooklyn Bridge to St

I mean you've gotten more black representation in the south for crying out loud and we've seen over the last forty years\nAnd in ... but but I mean if that's because we've allowed more voter access and how is this pretty more barriers\nI I think that the new real voter I the ... the ride the laws that have taken effect since nine eleven has really maybe ... maybe more difficult for people to get their driver's licenses renewed and ... and especially if they're not driving right now I've got a friend\nVery intelligent person had to return to the motor vehicle place three times because the rule I id law did they not require all the messed it up all these forms you no longer do you agree\nThat I Know what to pay rent you know I never advocated a real ID but yeah you do know that a lot of people can register online so\nMaybe you had an exemption on that one as well I read I don't go back and do my dinner ID or excuse me or my driver's I once\nYou upgrade from the old ... system to the one with the star on it then I think they have they been good but the initially to get that done\nThat I'm not I'm not back after nine eleven I'm I'm after we after nine eleven I so\nThey they don't show the rolling out when I started to expire which was like five or seven years after\nI still didn't mind without going back when\nLaws like photo ID start to get past and when you start to the polling places in terms of you know early vote our and being ... curtail the data shows actually limit participation why would we want to do that in the country that values and prides itself on democracy and on for participation\nReally had it again if you limit the days of early voting we pointed out that even after a bronco Obama in many states had limited because based on the resources of cost they were showing that many people were showing up and they limited here in Florida I think a lot for Thirteen to what was it nine days and they still have the same amount of people show up\nWhere are these voting barriers out there so why is it only won among minorities but it's not among other white people why is it I'm always curious by that or it\nMight be but only the minorities are blaming [laughter]\nI mean I don't have to [laughter] I don't think every individual from the minority is complaining are out\nThere for us but really arguing better pro voters and that has to be the way to\nRemember what Debbie Wasserman Schultz said a South Florida congresswoman\nOr that we could turn out the kinks\nNow you have the Republicans who want to literally drag us all the way an accidental cola\nAnd literally said patently block access to the poll voters who are more likely to those democratic candidates in Republican candidates and it's nothing\nCauses she's using the stereotype if he may be of a brown skin color you're automatically going to vote Democrat I don't buy into that\n... what if you're in South Florida you're Cuba just kind of curious on that one is what they literally want to take you back to Jim Crow more as we continue to move along All right let's take some calls\nMany people want to weigh in on this ah on these issues today Facebook voter id let's go to ah tripled you talk nine zero for triple do eight to five five Lawrence good morning you're on WB oh be\nA good morning they take him on I just want us\nI just want to say on the voter id law that Congress Republicans don't spend that money apparently so why didn't they just going to pass a law to pay for everybody to get around the and then we bought the ambulance argument\nWell you still find arguments against and they'll find out that that'd be better than the money wasn't properly ... distributed among maybe Republican states I mean it\nYou know and then all the uh\nThe Facebook controversy at Twitter ... ... you start talking about ferrets they look about what a pocket but I quit watching professional football because legal issue with the flag so\nIf you don't like Facebook do it and go do something or else it's it's a free country and it it's a that's a private company so I really\nAppreciate Roger before you're back to the phones you said you believe Facebook had was very instrumental in the two thousand sixteen a lecture and\nThose who are in what was in what way well there are a lot of ads who were purchased on Facebook who's seeing those ads by who would reach of I don't know\nI Know there was tend to one pay more by the Clinton campaign and out of quote Trump really yup huh\nAnd yet for Facebook at Facebook ads that's exactly correct and member member she outspent Trump bought five to one had out campaign from as far as maybe campaign workers eight to one here in the state of Florida Trump was still able to when you can defeat the monopoly so let's go to the gym\nI mean maybe not somebody at the gamble Ben Ali but hey Jim good morning on WB obey\nMoney and how you doing today hey good morning how are you doing I I Believe a lawsuit\nWith Facebook and these other social media companies have to do with whether they are platform or a publisher not so much a their freedom at the company I mean the New York times published anything they want but there are certain laws that\nAffect them at the publisher and ah you know Google you know so you do a search engine you search the word Republican state should come up just by highly hits it as well\nThey put an algorithm to adjust what you see now has become a publisher uh they're deciding what you see and that creates different laws so I Believe that's what the whole a case about whether their platform our publisher 'cause that affects how they can and cannot do this\nWell according to the article it's all based around the censorship of users out there I mean you we could I mean you you may bring up a valid point about being the publisher one way or the other but the bottom line is is that we're talking they're saying that should they not be able to censor speech in your post in my purse\nAnd you know I keep pointing out that I mean so Republicans aren't happy with it so now they want to regulate it I mean it's kind of like saying hey well you know the death as it was horrible under Obama but we got plenty of excuses why the deficit should increase under Trump\nWell I don't think it has to do with a crack about fairness it think it has to do with there are certain laws they have to follow suit paid settled Google uh you you have to follow certain rules current extra benefits you were given\nWell if you are not given those benefits even though you're a pay member while they no longer become that they're no longer a platform out there a publisher uh and and that's fine and you're right you're you're you're correct they can't get platform laws as a publisher\nRight but Jim you're talking for me for example Florida daily we pay on Facebook they'd always take her as we have to redo them and that's just the way Facebook has them but you're talking repay services says about free user agreements out there and should and that's the bottom line that's what the Supreme Court says\nShould these companies be able to censor it not based on you bring up a valid point you if it's if it's a pay every I agree with you because we're the ones who have a contract you do have certain rights and that contract but\nThis was a free user agreement then does the average Joe or gal have any right to to each to complain about Facebook of censorship one way or the other\n[noise] like if I were complaining about the New York times or what they published it can publish anything they want and Facebook can publish anything they want but they don't get to follow the same they want the same legal protection as a platform because they've officially become a publisher so I think the point is if it's a free site I should be able to use it as a platform is\nAm six hundred WB you'll be Jacksonville one on one point one FM W to six sixteen [noise]\nTalk

B. coming up in a few moments sound news from the James Madison Institute tax policies is there anything that is there from the sand just compare to Gillum you may be fascinated about the recent study they just did according to the McCain of center from George Mason university\nFlorida was ranked number one now the rank number four when it comes to fiscal\nSanity not insanity but fiscal health physical solvency so we'll get to all that here in just a little bit [noise]\nLet's get to it at dean here along with Roger Anderson Roger the economy is roaring there may be another could possibly be third quarter GDP around four percent but who knows but things are moving quite well\nAnd yet job openings are higher than those are unemployed CNBC is Rick Santelli obliquely advisory group CIA ...\nAmri last year I thought that was good and the revised last month was seven million in today's number was even higher poison is unreal the job openings any thoughts\nLabor markets solid delivered just shifting to employees as evidenced by this huge demand for labor like the lack of supply and we're seeing higher wages I think\nThe higher wages and Roger this which brings me into the next point\nAs you know here in the state of Florida big debate Andrew Gillum Ron dissenters of course out of Medicaid expansion yes there's an argument that he makes Medicare for all but he says he wants to put more on state run medicate and\nThe question we keep asking are there any type of work requirements out there and people can just get on Medicaid without really doing much when it comes to whether or not they have to work so many hours per each week\nThis question was asked by Fox Business news anchor Stewart Barney with author of the book porn no more Peter cope\nPosed to suppose hypothetical\nOf three children you've got to stay home to take care of those kids and you are single mothers single parent you get Medicaid would you be kicked off because you can go get a job when you've got three kids at home as long as\nDaycares available and daycare generally and surveillance so if they care is available should be able to go to work that is what we did in Nineteen eighty Ninety six and that's why the roles went down and people went to war and no one went starving\n... by the way several if not many states offer\nLow income families pretty much a lot of free daycare when it comes to that start Parker from the center for urban renewal education says when you look at policies by what Andrew Gillum wants to impose and buy those of other Democrats about Medicaid expansion with no work requirements she says it it it's like the welfare system\nAnd it hasn't changed for the last Thirty years\nTake advantage of this new opportunity that try to see if we can include work and training and other mechanisms so that people will move from sitting on their couch\nAs they're getting their Medicaid and maybe start getting more involved and participate in in their own lives and in our society that we're real issue on hand you're absolutely right brought out of that well for what Thirty years ago and nothing has changed since then we're able to just do whatever you want to do there's little requirement for people to get back\nTo society there's not a requirement for the folks that are\nSitting there taking advantage of somebody else's work so that's a good move to start getting much more creative about how we distribute a anti poverty money's tax money is to the states for them to help those that are most vulnerable\nDid you hear what I mean every one more time did you did you hear what she said just just a moment ago about\nTheir take advantage of this new opportunity that try to see if we can include work and training other mechanisms southern people will move from sitting on their couch\nPeople will move from sitting on the couch has she been start Parker by the way as a black conservative is she saying that people are just sitting around getting free health\nCare I think that's possible you know not just healthcare but a lot of government benefits and there's all this wasted genius out there that could be used to make society a lot better I think she just wants to encourage that yeah there's a financial a problem that all of us end up having to you know help finance when they're not using that creative junior spit it out see why it helps the person I was sitting on the\n... the days of Bill Clinton the Democrats in Nineteen Ninety six and the welfare as we know it when he did put work requirements and why should I keep asking why are we not putting work requirements for people that are on Medicaid\nAgain whether it's S.

branch they don't know I'm ...\nI don't know what I'm asking for an idea yeah\nI don't believe that's the case that could be I Believe that they actually can pull my face up when the heal my account or on a screen and they see a photograph of my idea but it's on on the account now whether it out there running policies in place to prevent them from doing that unless I show up I don't know\nWell my bank that I've been at for Twenty years and change they still make me showing id if I go to a different branch of people don't know normally yeah I'm the last part most importantly is buildings that responsibility and a right of citizens\nSo I'm the longer the voting period is the more easy it is for her to her it's not the point of it is not necessarily to make it easy to make it available and uh as the previous caller said\nThere is no difficulty in getting these for any purpose if you want to buy alcohol somewhere you have to have an id if you want to board a plane you have to happen I think so no I bought\nIt appreciate them I think the same way I can show mighty all the time and I've been with him for many many years Democrats said that if they are\nBulls the privileged which they think they are or if they get to take over the house of representatives in Congress this year that they will one of their first agenda items is to push for a ... team dollar an hour federal\nMinimum wage is you know Ron ... says this is the problem with Andrew Gillum campaign that this is what he wants to do many Democrats say that Haiti eight ten bucks not enough we do to get on the road of a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage the reason why well\nAmazon did it but the question is did Amazon do it because of the state government or did they do it because it was inevitable a lot of companies are going down that road based on the marketplace\nFormer Toys R us EEO general store said it was inevitable it was going to happen\nSo rated the inevitable and they were able to grab a victory from something that was a negative for them [noise]\nThe wages are going out no matter what the economy is very high unemployment is very low or you know uh the in some jurisdictions fifty hours hours going to be mandated [laughter] you know in some areas in New York City it's going to start at the turn of the turn of the year so [noise] even the get workers retires are having to pay more\nAlready so they saw this coming I Know I talked to a number of retailers constantly and many were already thinking about doing this\nHe says they're already thinking about doing this Roger based on the market place not least on the government yes it's true\nThat for example like New York city is now putting a surcharge on what you eat in your bill could that be possibly one of the agenda items that may be Andrew Gillum and other Democrats because they've said that they will support a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage if he gets elected but yet he says he also help subsidize companies that have to pay for that wage\nSubsidize the with money I guess ours that uh you know takes a lot of me thinking about whether or not that's good I watched\nIt is is is that because of the economy or is it because of government I like to hear from you and tripled to talk tripled to eight to five five Amazon November the person's going to pay all employees Fifteen bucks an hour a member here in Jacksonville they already said they were gonna start off up to Fifteen bucks an hour\nIs is because they feel that they still marketplace going down that road or do you think that they did it because it was inevitable that maybe some state governments may try to phases in at Fifteen bucks an hour it's\nPossible you a little bit of that plus may be able to get PR move because as we heard earlier a they're going to be phasing out the stock options when they roll out the Fifteen dollar minimum ... wage so that actually ended up causing them to a compensated their employees even less even although they're getting\nThe causing them to a composite of their employees even less even although they're getting more per hour\nThat fear on the one side they say raise the minimum wage it helps people and help their families and on the thing is it's either saying no cost jobs now this New York city restaurants or at a tipping point that restaurant owners now pushing lawmakers in New York City\nTo let them adding up to five percent surcharge an extra tax on restaurant customer that we've got a group representing more than one hundred restaurants tourists they drafted a letter\nNoting that they have endured nine mandated wage increases over the past that wire also a lot of rules and regulations and other wage hike to Fifteen bucks an hour\n... if it Gillum gets elected governor he's leading all the polls right now and he becomes governor okay and he wants to go down to Fifteen dollars an hour minimum wage remember John Morgan says he or don't want to put on the ballot in two thousand twenty bucks twenty twenty\nWhich means I Wonder if they make compromises ten twelve bucks an hour I think that's ... ... if you want to pay for it they're talking now in fact some people will be before the id you just heard from Fox Business news Elizabeth McDonald as a surcharge an extra five percent on your meal on your tab\nIn order to suffice of pain for that that means that local cities will have to pick up the tab that means that local restaurants are going to charge you more they're going to be mandated to have to raise your taxes\nTo pay for the surcharges and they'll just be an extra rely on your bill I Would imagine what's stopping the restaurants just charging more for the ... the way\nBecause they have to disclose all that in some cases triple to

Q\nA and gets the legislature go along on the corporate tax increase you'd lose ... found a hundred and fifty thousand jobs in the state every year and the anywhere you know in the neighborhood of Fifteen to twenty billion dollars in economic activity\nThat in turn create the ... effect on revenues so you Jack up the corporate tax rate and you end up with less revenue to fund the things that government canning really should be do\nAlso you guys broke it down with Ron ... is there anything new or innovated that's just than just wants to do\nWith the current economic climate you know because or does he want to keep the status quo you know a lot of people argue against the status quo but the status quo seems to be what relatively working under President Trump and governor Rick Scott\nDoes he want to keep things the way they are going now or is there any difference between the current policies we see that the census also maybe wants to implement\nSure there are a couple of specific tax cuts that are are really important that Jim I Want been a proponent of of ... in debt for variety of reasons we have it at first is the communication service tax uh every single person with a cell phone aids is a Florida is the highest in the country\nUm and it it's something that can and should be brought down to a more reasonable level a candidate to saint as as as absolutely or advocated or that it at all the puzzle the second one is a business rent pack\nThis is something that Florida has that no other state in the country does we we had a sales tax on the leaf thing of buildings it hit every rent or whether you're a small business or an individual\nYou're paying for this and a candidate to say it has has has indicated he would like to get rid of that\nUm but largely a other than those two things on the tax and economic trajectory he he really wants to and and I would say wisely maintain a lot of the policies of Jeb Bush in ... that have created on average about two hundred thousand jobs year\nWe bounce back from the great recession faster than any other uh any other state the United states unemployment rate is it three point seven percent and\nUm they nationally or just yesterday there's there over seven billion open jobs right now and that is a a clear sign of of the economic health and that's kind of the message that I think are the candidate that this is a kind of come back\nWe're talking with sound news though he's the vice president of the policy for the James Madison Institute added Tallahassee the website James Madison dot org they've got a breakdown of both policies on tax situations would\nExcuse me with Andrew Gillum and that a ... but what's out what I find fascinating is this whole debate around the minimum wage you know Amazon did it they said it was inevitable um eat on Bernie Sanders in the last say that it was because of been promoting it uh the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage we have the free market people say now because of the economy that's why\nA lot of people may go even though it may not happen overnight but through certain pay a month to pay a pay increase will go up\nHaving said all that if you have a fit teen dollar an hour minimum wage\nThe the uh Gillum supporters and give them self as hinted that they can also take care of and held businesses that are that deal with that mandate I'm always curious how what do you because he doesn't exempt small businesses in his plans how about a hundred employees you're going to pay the minimum wage at five employees no exemptions you're going to pay the minimum wage\nHow does he planned to fly and small businesses if he gets his way\nThis is the this is the tack of someone with socialist tendencies or this is ... if you're going to create a floor for wages and then use taxes in order to prop up the businesses that can't pay it\nIs an actor is a recipe for economic catastrophe now is ultimately in any any economist will tell you ultimately the minimum wage is in fact the hero because the folks who do not get employment because of the minimum wage\nThey're not getting paid a Fifteen dollar minimum wage would be\nAlmost double what Florida has right now\nIt'd been tried in places like Seattle and a couple of other jurisdictions they have huge regret they're they're just\nThe leading jobs and bleeding businesses from any

B. O. B.\nSo is the campaign continues one of the biggest questions issues um especially here in Florida\nIs Ron dissenters run on the status quo which is believe it or not is usually you run against but the status quo was worked here in Florida\nFor many years under governor Jeb Bush will slow down with Charlie Crist the governor Rick Scott when it comes to the issue of\nFinancial solvency our friends at the ... center\nAt George Mason university you have a recent study they do this every year about the financial solvency of all the top states highly Norcross is the vice president a policy at their McCain of center she's here on our news making line so what made this more interesting about this I lead that this more than a decade\nFrom that of the great recession you guys are pointed out that that Florida still rings in the top five but\nNot all the other states have recovered why is that\n[noise] yeah um some states haven't recovered poor fiscal practices states that have ranked at the bottom of our study have shown and edit the only ever climbed to balance the budget or to have enough for a rainy day and continue to rely on duct tape for some of their ongoing extensions\nThe top five number one was Nebraska number to South Dakota number three was Tennessee number four was Florida number five was Oklahoma the bottom five this isn't surprising a was Kentucky Massachusetts\nNew Jersey Connecticut at the bottom of the list Illinois holy mackerel\nCourse a lot of those except for me to Kentucky are blue states having said that Florida did ring number one last year they dropped down to number five why was that\nA drop in his he changed the methodology a little bit we weren't paying a lot of weight on the short term thirty percent or past thirty percent for budget this year we moved away so that that's the reason for that drop otherwise if we have kept those weights on they'd be in second place this year but that being said you go back and look over the last ten years and Florida that's pretty well\nWhen you when you look at this where is the areas that Florida ... ... is the strongest when you talk about quote financial stability and financial solvency\nActually do well in all category but at the tick you're on the short short run they've gotta and how the level of cash reserves change four and five times the cash\nNeeded to cover the short term that their revenues exceed expensive like seven percent that that's a little bit of a buffer and then on the long run they get better than average or they have half the size of the liabilities a solitary assets of other states and their pension liability again are smaller relative to the other states\nI leave that wait a second I only be average it will be listening to this I said is a little tongue in cheek but you look at the other states at the bottom fifty that don't like so well with funding to solvency every year are always increasing taxes and yet they don't have enough money yet Florida for the last several years has been cutting taxes and you just said they've got a lot more cash on hand\nMhm yeah that's right I think it's just ... and these are only very general metrics\nHere so we can't say too much about it but we can say that forward it does seem that tricking practices at having enough money on reserves and not and and their revenues are are greater than expenses I'm like at the bottom states for New Jersey for instance has not had had been running a structural deficit for well over a decade\nThere on our newsmakers ... north across is the VP of policy I threw McCain center at George Mason university they do this every year they put out all the state rankings of physical health fiscal stability fiscal solvency and it's a great study we followed many years you go to the website ... dot org McKay to start or let me get a little deeper in the weeds here\nUm Florida still does quite well in the top ten when it comes to unfunded pension liability is out there and what makes floor to different than from other states\nI Would say I'd say that a little bit of caution Florida does better relative to the other states All right um\nAnd it but you're you're you're up against Illinois and New Jersey and others but when you look at the unfunded liability I go back in and re value that like it's guaranteed to be paid for his reporting a twenty four billion dollar uncharted liability I re estimate that and I say it's closer to two hundred and fifty three billion unfunded a which means it's only\nThirty seven percent find that that's pretty large a\nRelative to the income state residents you know it it is it's it's twenty seven percent of the income of the residents of Florida said again it's better relative to the other\nTwenty seven percent of the income of the residents of Florida said again upset or relative to the other states but it's still pretty large and something Florida should just keep an eye on\nFinally these you know the Supreme Court came out in this past year and the Janice decision about you know about certain funds being taken away from those of union members to fund political campaigns\nSome people think this is going to have a trickle down effect dealing with some of the states because there are some states that have their pensions and unfunded liabilities tied to a state constitution remembers for example if some of these states go south they may have to acquire a bailout from the federal government this has been very under reported issue that you guys have covered\nAnd yet we we've been watching that for a while and take your Illinois but that states everyone is looking at because of that constitutional protection and the court has ruled that yeah you can't cut these benefits you're gonna have to figure this out so it it is it going to come from taxes or they can't cut the benefits and that's a huge number so that as a concern and arrest that they would seek a federal bailout\nEileen is this just among Illinois or is this among other states again where they tied way getting let me ... I mean before we go for the let me explain this little bit even though you're a policy\nThat some people they may try to pass a an amendment like amendment twelve or whenever it in a certain stadium just give me a hypothetical\nHey we want to keep pension solving voted this amendment blah blah blah it's part of the state constitution which means some cases unless the state government can do something about the legislative process they have to have another voter approval is Illinois the only state we see with a lot of these problems are we seeing other states out there as well\nFor a couple of states the constitutional protections New York in Alaska\nOther states protect these benefits in statutes a New Jersey a several dozen other they they protected and statues and makes it harder for the benefits to the altered or so and then we had California rolls and California which is it's a very\nSimilar to that and that it said like you can't take a benefit away once granted some states I use that as the guidelines so yes it depends on the nature of the promises constitution are statute and the degree to which it can be changed\nI mean when you guys do the studies every year and you really breaking down compared to other groups out there again go to McCain does that or read the latest physical a solvency among the states here in the country for last year number one this year they're ranked number four but still doing overall pretty good compared to the national average\nWhen you guys do this you heavily and to me I think the pensions unions is always a big issue here in this country are there are states that they were blue or red or they finally getting the idea that hey you know where the floods arising here you better start preparing for the day or they still kicking the can down the road\nI Would argue that the wealthy that work an extreme amount of hours have a harder time getting out to register to vote because of the amount of hours that they work there is actually a a video for campus reform where they went and interviewed students from Berkeley\nAnd then they went and interviewed individuals whack individuals' from Harlem and asked them if they thought it was a racist or discriminatory they get a voter id and the kids from Berkeley all came up with the same conclusion that\n... ... oh well they're poor or they don't have the means or they do a or they're not intelligent enough to know where to go vote\nWhere all the individuals from Harlem came out and said you know oh yeah I Know exactly where to go oh yeah I got my driver's license oh I've got that and it just goes to show you the race that might not last that they think that black people are incapable of taking care of themselves to register to vote\nYou know that's an interesting take em you got cities like Chicago let me let me ask this question to James is pointing US cities in Chicago South Florida\nThat are pushing for an ID card for homeless people and for\nIllegal aliens now folks if they want to push for those individuals\nThen why is it that we want to relax it for those that are already here in this country somebody say legally and\nAre contributing to society out there is that makes sense I mean I I mean here is a I think\nWhat you're going to get a lot from the minorities was probably a backlash from history because you know I think all of us will agree to colonize God if people are those thoughts of their minds they haven't gotten over a decade issue\nBut remember I keep asking current cats right forget the past I understand about the future current tense forget the history because Jim\nCrow not only did affect poor black individual also affected poor white Republicans out there [noise] so how long are we going to use this history card out their\nTripled to talk tripled to eight to five five let's go to John John good morning you're on WB obey\nWell that's what the communist Democrats use right rape racism and uh the rich but anyway I wanted to go back to you know your economics professor who had on there talking about that the\nState constitution to uh uh basically guarantee stay pensions listen that means the CFO could be Donald Duck and the tax payers are still on the hook correct that should be abolished we all take our risks in the market and we're all susceptible\nIt should be abolished we all take risks and market and we're all susceptible to marketing okay the Fifteen dollar minimum wage is an absolute\nJoke about paperwork a hair salon fast food restaurants gas stations cold boost movie theater I tend to try a state landscape present the fire holders this time it was an all your overtime might what radiance will be gone\n[noise] your benefits will be gone they're using one trillion dollar company for all your little you know all the businesses are poor member were foot radiant because we have the policies of the nor we had anyone that goes up to the north despise us those policies\nOkay and I wonder worn on my ... about ... amendment eleven amendment a lemon on the ballot is used for illegal aliens that are caught committing crimes okay basically gives them a waiver from any type of prosecution or or or um what's it called property confiscation now now the ... which is the uh\nThe F. L. C. R. C. left all this information\nOut of the ballot okay it just says oh do you want your property rights or soccer protected and they say yes or no mentions nothing about illegal aliens and you won't get that Lehman book you have to ask for the amendment book because you will not get it at the poll I already voted and I voted red\n... you know with all the amendments or did you vote for a couple in favor\nI voted and couple in favor alright I had to ask for the amendment book but I voted for it was it was so distracted let me tell you something that's on elected appointed counsel right should be abolished\nThey should be abolished the F. L. C. should be abolished period we let the legislators make policy not these cars it let me tell you something even though a lot a lot of them were reported by the governor there left is there actually you know\nYeah I mean and I got to get go I uh I'm a constitutional measures nobody cares about how I ... there's a problem that you have to redo\nBecause it's in the state constitution for example the tax exemption you have to keep it going by voting in the state constitution amendment\nOh you were looking like California folks and ...\nAnd fellow no voting rights restoration that's going to be handled because the court said we've got to do something about that one yeah they\nGot all this can be done through the state process you're elected representatives out there but yet we seem to want to disparage your boat I mean we want to give you a say but you vote for certain individual that needs to vote on these issues and we're just saying about would leave it to the people like gambling like\nMarijuana and then they write it's such a confusing ways are set to throw one of them off the ballot\nFrank good morning you're on WB obey\nHey how you doing hey what's going on this morning well you know it's kind of funny how these people who don't have the ability to go get an id ah and fill out paperwork have the ability to uh fill out the paperwork to get food stamps welfare and everything else [noise]\nWell I Would think when you need an ID for that as well\nYes you do I'm unemployed and I have to uh these people have to fill out paperwork\nStep up no problem doing that\nYeah I mean you have to have an ID for most anything today\nPardon my pond from Atlanta it's ludicrous little hip hop lingo therefore you triple too dark triple to eight to five five but bottom line today is why do you not need an ID or why do you need an ID theater and says hey\nVoter suppression you're voting rights Brett Kavanaugh by the way because of him that Donald Trump putting more but because of Brett Kavanaugh Yu king chairs all of those goodbyes what he's saying more coming up next on TALK radio W.
