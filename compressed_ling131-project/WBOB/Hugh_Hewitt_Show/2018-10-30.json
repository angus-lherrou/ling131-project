B. O. B.\nSo let's get to it and we are now less than a week away from the two thousand and Eighteen midterms but primarily here in Florida the latest public opinion research lab lab how do you like that as a polling University of north Florida shows that Andrew Gillum has opened up\nThe lead he leads among likely voters forty nine percent of that around the scientists at forty three percent and and I believe the latest on the governor is about a ... against governor Rick Scott Nelson's at forty seven forty six what do you think about those numbers\nInteresting they're up and down some polls put them a little closer that were just as Rhys it a lot of people have voted already I think it's going to come to turn out that it's going to be who shows up at the poll to support their team\nOf course I'm a gay people in this may be fake news whatsoever President Trump was asked by lowering the anger mango what do you think about the campaign to anything special but that raised down there in Florida\nTo individual races Florida obviously so important to twenty twenty but important period and getting stronger than tests are running a congressman strong supporter of yours [noise] over the weekend you call the Andrew Gillum you referenced him being safe\nWhile the FBI offering tickets at Eighteen hundred dollars a piece and he took them\nWill technically it was a thousand dollars apiece but who's counting riots\nTook a trip with the same as the eye agent posing as a developer or something man it was so cold and stuff I don't even think he shouldn't be allowed to continue on with\nThe refinery today by calling you we hear how they can win that\nThough I haven't heard that one lately that's okay good that's a change of pace in my opinion is a stone cold thing\nIs is ... is the most corrupt and what are the most\nHigh technically that's not true it it's one of them but Miami is way more corrupt no cut then again there was counting writer author\nOf the nation [noise] he's a disaster and how he's even closer to being tired it's hard to believe but Florida cannot Florida has a governor like that [noise] and I know Florida better than I Know practically anywhere Florida will become Venezuela it will be asked\nTo finally by the way the latest poll shows that are restoring rights for a ... or felons were store and voting rights at sixty almost Seventy percent but you need sixty I Believe to cross the gas right away in a debate way way across that again hey can I ask a question on this one let me to the audience out there\nAndrew Gillum is being investigated by the FBI or affiliations of those with Andrew Gillum\nShould ... if I wanted to ask a clash of the listener out there is is more important to you than the issues of the corporate tax income increase he wants to rain the Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage where he's going to get the money for Medicaid expansion what is the more important issue because I feel that email me talking about talking about the FBI where it's been found guilty of anything else right\nI mean ... guilty to ... I guess the other way around guilty to prove it had this is Roger Roger we see that with cab and opera but I mean it it was more important to talk about the FBI would get what may or may not be there when you you'd be lied or is the question more about the issues of the day\nRight and even with the uh Broadway tickets which are surprisingly expensive I had no idea Broadway plays with vowels and the oldest person nonetheless he said that what they do this compensated by buying the FBI informant who he thought was the developer tickets to the beyond say Jay Z concert so he thought it was an even swap\nDays there are well that's the question I mean you the audience has to decide that forty nine forty three and seven percent undecided\nUm as of right now in drug it looks like he could be your next governor yeah if you if you read the polls if you buy and ... and he's letting it was a time when it comes to some people try to cover similarities Roger you know as you know it's conventional wisdom its history that shows the the part of that's in power and only loses seats\nAnd they kind of lose power but is there any similarities between\nTwenty years ago ... term ... mid term off year elections what happened in Nineteen Ninety eight Bill Clinton was in ... but also was disliked by members of the media\nA member did more south or protecting twenty five thirty Republican gains in the U.S house and he gained six Senate seats is there a similarity between all by the way\nIf the Iowa there were certain actually well I was just the FBI there were certain investigations going on the independent counsel a lot of similarities with President Trump how is this going to come out play into the elections Fox News' Mike Emanuel there are\nCertainly some interesting similarities between now and Twenty years ago both president Donald Trump than Bill Clinton had strong economies going in their favor\nEgypt criticized what they consider to be unfair media coverage both a forty second and forty fifth presidents how to deal with special legal pros and Clinton zero with independent counsel Kenneth Starr now of course President Trump is dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller\nThis time Republican leaders are campaigning against Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker again and warning that Democrats like Adam Schiff Maxine Waters could be committee chairs if Democrats are in charge\nAnd this is quite interesting um I get a lot of emails from listeners as you know and they're saying the economy the economy the economy I don't disagree with that and I don't I don't even hear Rick Scott talking about the success\nOf his economy hits and I understand why the arguments against Bill Nelson he's been in office for forty two years and he's one of the poster child for term limits I get all that argument out there\nBut yet I don't hear Rick Scott talking about how well the economy's done in the state of Florida I don't hear what the Republicans talking about the economy and set its own no if the Democrats take over this might be scary enough without waiting here for that Maxine Waters Adams\nThey go over and this might be scary enough without Halloween here for that Maxine Waters Adam Schiff who else knows may take over some of these committees I Know\nSome very open minded Democrats who will agree about the economy is doing really good under Donald Trump but it wasn't doing so great under President Obama at least compared to where it is right now but they do not make the connection with the mid term elections and President Trump they probably will vote for Trump and twenty twenty\nThis particular I'm a mid term elections the Democrats I Know so they're going to go with their part\nIs just enough to give voters houses sit back and say oh no Nancy Pelosi could be your next speaker of the house is that enough to drive out Republicans do you think\nI Believe it will and we are seeing some you know a historic guy increases and expectations of the voter turnout for mid term election especially will be enough to take the Republicans across the top that's still\nI don't really believe that it's hard to believe that we used to be able to have a kind of thinking and what do they live at the ... the United states have allied themselves with white laugh lines and how\nHe's a well can I ask you I just I'm trying to find out these white nationalist that he's aligned himself with maybe they're talking about Charlottesville may be OK I'm OK I Would ask the question again maybe the biggest group of people that he's aligned himself with right\nWell they have align themselves with him you know when it whenever you see in the white nationalist rally many of them say they support Trump but that's not his fault\nNo of course it's not us all but then again the black lives matters in Obama align themselves with each other and people blame them for all this stuff that happened in Ferguson and Baltimore and five dollars cops being shot back in two thousand sixteen Howard Kurtz from media buzz says there's blame game has got to stop with the guilt by association\nNails it because of qualifying for the press to try to hold and President Trump accountable for sometimes divisive sometimes incendiary rhetoric this whole idea of guilt by association blood on their hands I didn't like those kind of comments on their President Obama I don't like the same that President Trump being tied to the actions of lunatics or filled with have\nAt the same time when the liberal group of Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh says don't come we don't want you here and you win cited this attack I mean none of them I didn't ...\nUh it seems like who cares at this point who started as anybody president press political parties to stop it as opposed to pointing fingers but who started kind of rise above and help us lower the just the little\nGuy there you go on that one I mean you can't blame Obama frightening and rightfully so but ... go ahead and blame President Trump President Trump says he's going to send an additional fifty two hundred troops us troops to the border he says I'm not letting the man he calls it an invasion with Fox News ... you'll\nUnderstand what you're saying the military Mr President I'm being called bio election here\nIn politics or is that Israel when you look at that thousands of people [laughter] somebody said you know now that when they know that now I'm pretty good at figuring out how many people ... people in the ... when you looked at the bridge loaded up with people\nThat's called an invasion of our country this has nothing to do with elections and I've been saying this long before election I wouldn't say it's been for a run for office we have to have strong motorcycle what happens is when catch and release\nCatching were not releasing so they want to come over but we're not even doing that we're not letting them into this country we're not going to lend gang members\nOkay so he calls it in an invasion is that I mean I've heard that term used ten Fifteen Years ago right it in some cases it is an invasion depending on how you want to phrase it you could call when he invaded my house last night if you could say that right\nIn ... it's probably accurate to call it an invasion would frightens me about sending troops to the borders and I'm not saying we shouldn't is that what happens with the if these people continue to cross into the U.S and you've got our members of the U.S military do you open fire on them I Hope not\nAh probably not rubber bullets I don't know I I don't I'm not sitting there waiting to happen I don't I don't know\nIt could be a scary confrontation and we just hope it in ... then again\nI see cops in streets that are able to push people back to to send a message\nAnd maybe tear gas or something of a matter of fact in Mexico finally stepping up to the plate here\nYou do notice that the majority those there didn't want to citizenship for our ... what is it legal or not citizenship living um areas do I'm applying for Mexico they turned them down ... yeah\nFor asylum isn't the law because Congress lifestyle and we're going to hold him until such time as a trial where we have the facilities are going to put up we're going to build cities were gonna put tents all over the place we're not going to know structures and spend all of this you know hundreds of millions of dollars\nWe're gonna have intense they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get the salaries they get out and very few people they don't actually want to weigh usually get asylum you know the eighty percent of the problem is they released them in and then they have the trial three years later and nobody shows a\nNobody shows up truck and Carlson says here's the real problem that no one and I've asked this question the last several years here's the real problem he says that no one's discussed and if we have quote twenty two million illegal aliens here he says after nine eleven\nWe have quote twenty two million illegal aliens here he says after nine eleven what are we supposed to track individuals down with the real id law to make sure that we know who's here in this country out\nThat if you had a twenty two million foreign nationals living in your country under false pretenses was hurting federal documents\nWouldn't you being completely freaked out about that let's say they were Russia die from ... there aren't even twenty two million he brings\nUp the boy he was the last to be all up in arms if there were Russians but of course there is south of the border the potential voters so nobody really seems\nLike the only people that are being monitored post nine eleven are us citizens groping Grande at the airport as opposed to going after the people were coming to the country illegally\n... I don't think but if there were\nUpset with him but isn't the lesson nine eleven that you want to know who's in your country here we have a ... response nine eleven it says it that will documents cannot be forced you can't use fake ones\nFight try that in an airport I go to jail we've got twenty two million people doing it every single day down\nTo my bank and trying to open an account using fake federal documents the response and the cops being like you know we need a comprehensive approach to this calling you did it I get it you've got a family here just trying to open a fake bank account because you know you're probably a good person we need abroad in Congress who say well Sony jail\nDoes this debate in this is a concern I keep asking why is that no one ever brings up that I'm a ... a bunch of those illegally doesn't matter that they come from central doesn't mean they'll come from um um Mexico they've come from Canada they come from overseas a lot of us come from Honduras Ecuador\nThe bottom line is is when you see a lot of these packing companies been rated they'd been ready to because they have fake Social Security card and fake medicate carts fake Medicare card fake but registration fake bank cards and\nBake as I did it say driver's license Social Security cards that is the easy no one seems to be talking about\nYou know they're they're not they're just focusing all their attention things on the people who were no threat the average American citizen\nYeah but then again it's all race thing to the left because they're brown skinned and things like that but no one ever talked about that I mean again if this would have happened by Americans man with a felony you know you could try to get your voting rights back and he's actually allowed to vote your point more as we continue to move along\nTalk radio W.

move along at dean Roger Henderson on TALK radio WB obey\nAt it you'll be consistency I Believe spikes up especially down you know who wants to dump spike and uh uh I think over time if you could keep at third for three percent I think that's probably the better option\nAnd does the election looked like Nineteen Ninety eight summit terms Bill Clinton was been looking to be impeached remember Donald Trump same thing the Democrats being investigated by special counsel same thing with President Trump\nLook at maybe those are the FBI and predictions of a there was a productions of a big red way than Nineteen Ninety eight now there are predictions of a big blue wave in two thousand and eight teams excuse me any similarities Fox News' Mike Emanuel\nThing there are certainly some interesting similarities between now and Twenty years ago both president Donald Trump and Bill Clinton had strong economies going in their favor Egypt criticize what they consider to be unfair media coverage both on forty second and forty fifth presidents how to deal with special legal probes\nIn Clinton's zero was independent counsel Kenneth Starr now of course President Trump is dealing with special counsel Robert Mueller\nThis time Republican leaders are campaigning against Nancy Pelosi becoming speaker again and warning that Democrats like Adam Schiff Maxine Waters could be committee chairs if Democrats are in charge\nSo here's the thing we know that negative campaigning works my question\nIf you're one of those undecided voters that switching to either Republican or Democrat ... do you vote for dissenters based on FBI investigations into whatever association with them\nEven though nothing's been proven yet or do you associate that have the economy's doing well under governor Rick Scott already associate sitting back and have Gillum gets and the psychological aspect to small business out there are Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage nothing's going to happen but just the thought process\nOr do you sit back and go home and gee polo see Maxine Waters what's coming up next I don't I don't know does this really Maxine Waters becoming chair the committee does Nancy Pelosi becoming the next house speakers that really you think drives people to the\nPoll I think when it comes to your house of representatives a guy or a lady I think that people are going to vote for who they got people love their congressmen and of course there's always that incentive to keep them as long as possible because then they grow in seniority and then can end up affecting the district I I\nI ... that has nothing that's not what I'm getting I understand about the pork barrel I'm Talking about the opposite side based on what they talked about impeachment investigations left and right\nI think the drought for a lot of people who listen to this show I think the U.S Senate race will be probably try to keep acidic as Republican responsible for the court appointments and uh I Believe that people will vote for whoever isn't it all the income that I think the pound very very very very ...\nAgain I'm Talking about specific and how does a Nancy Pelosi horror Maxine what or whoever the Republicans like does that motivate\nDo you believe voters to go to the polls not at all I don't that's what I was I don't believe it will I think that people like their their income\nBut I think you're right on the Senate yeah especially on the areas that again for the for the Supreme Court picks more as we continue to move along tripled you talked triple do eight to five five let's go to David David good morning you're on WB you'll be how are you\nIn any um I'm not sure about what trade that he said he's basically saying that echo chambers you know yeah and I and I agree with her church that\nOnly recently no I've been telling people why I wrote it for the simple the individual mandate and that was that's it and eat it and I'm happy\n[noise] you know do you think of that too many on the left it on the right to sit around and as one of my ... and this was an email from a friend he says we have too much ... or intellectual incest he says we sit around and we tried to convince each other instead of having a debate but but then again David maybe it is it that in the old days you sat back on a ... a Saturday morning or Sunday after church\nAnd you have a conversation about the issues are disregarding where your political party is we don't have those anymore\nNow they are they just they say like how could you vote for him who right because this is that they don't ask why they did and they want your either your really good or not\nYeah David thanks for making your point in my friend ... chamber I get criticism for members on the edge you don't do enough to cover Gillum and the FBI well nothing's been proven what do you want me to ask about the FBI they're investigating Trump without the FBI now this is what I have to be consistent here I'm always asking for consistency here from our listeners\nThat if you're going to I mean it's not ... nobody buys into the FBI investigation to President Trump ... hey that's fine I I don't think there's really think they're all but we're ready to go Blaine Gillum here and I'm not that hey I again if I got to be consistent basis into proven guilty like Brett Kavanaugh I'd have\nTo be consistent on this issue so my question is do you out there listening at tripled you talk nine to report tripled to eight to five I mean you can disagree with me\nBut do you think it was more important to vote against Andrew Gillum based on an FBI investigation or based on his issues which are very far left to\nExactly and you know having that conversation after church you know you got ... and I can talk about the average person out there they don't want to get beat up by somebody for software\nProbably give you the typical Democrats on this radio show will tell you they're not voting against Trump because of an FBI investigations are everybody gets Trump based on his policy exactly want to hear what you think nine zero for triple to eight to five five talk radio WB obey\nBut I'd like to be five going south just

[laughter] you know what is the most corrupt and Florida and what are the most corrupt in the nation he's a disaster technically\nIt's Miami but that's again again who's counting\nOh he's even close to being tied it's hard to believe for Florida cannot Florida has a governor like that and I know them better than I Know practically anywhere Florida will become Venezuela it will be a disaster learn to\nBecome better way like kill more as we continue to move along\nThe latest university north Florida polls show that Andrew Gillum is still consistently are leading Rhonda centers and the two thousand and aging given a tour of race according to respond as of likely voters Gillum was at forty nine to stances that forty three seven percent of undecided even if he split that courting the poll numbers give them still wet\nSuit exactly that's outside of the margin of error but it's going to come out the turnout if the Republicans get they're based out in bigger numbers even though we're you know the ... the head of the crew pillows upset\nAmong independents and non party affiliations normally you would think would do for the Republicans according to the latest poll numbers out their fifty six percent plan to vote for Gillum only thirty one percent\nFor dissent and said to statistical dead heat shows that Bill Nelson is leading Rick Scott forty seven forty six let's go a little bit further for the attorney general's race actually moody lease Shaun Shaun the Democrat\nForty seven to forty percent and of course Florida commissioner of agriculture Nikki Fried leads Republican Mac Caldwell forty one uh yeah it was forty three is a forty three to forty one percent that's just so so you know let me ask the question to you out there do you believe these are fake polls\nI don't believe they're fake I think that the uh the universities they put their reputations on the line and we'll be election day comes out of course they want to have bragging rights and say hey we told you so uh but you know anything can happen no one thought for example but Andrew Gillum would end up becoming the Democratic nominee for the governor's race in Florida he was supposed to come in third not first\nCourse storing voting rights to salads this is one of the big ones on the ballot according to the poll numbers out there among some of the other ... they're not really been garnering fifty percent by what you gotta get sixty but this is quite an interesting one according to the latest numbers by the University of Florida\nWe're storing voting rights and by the way let's break it down by color okay alright\nFelons sixty nine\nI getting restoring voting rights to fell in sixty nine percent say yes you need sixty percent as you point out and put on the state constitutional ballot only twenty three percent say no\nNow regarding race Ninety three percent of those and the black community say yes sixty six percent of white respondents and sixty one percent of Hispanics responded said that they would vote yes you know what that is that is a Superman that's almost a super majority\n... it it shows that people I Believe are are looking at their principles I think a lot of people who say that OK we need to have time to prove that they were going to do right do going forward they really don't want to see a lot more democratic votes to be honest with you but uh I think people are saying you know if someone served their time they've paid all defines us very let's give them a right to vote back the Democrats\nHave a decent shot at picking up a U.S house of representatives here's the question what type of candidate or they're running we keep hearing about the far left according to chairman of the Democratic congressional committee Democrat Ben ray Lujan he says no we're running a more moderate\nType of the in the general election of a Democrat but listen to what type the running\nI'm confident the Democrats will win back the house this year we built our strategy around our candidates are incredible men and women with record the service many ... served our country in the U.S military a former CIA officers FBI agents who committed their lives to keeping our country safe\nSo there you go to the running military individuals and people that have worked supporting independents contracts ... yeah that would sell I think among Democrats you'd would\nWhen it comes to the issue also of the area of\nThe synagogue shooting there still are left are still trying to blame\nPresident Trump to listen to this debate that took place between David Urban former Trump adviser who's a CNN commentator and Julia Roberts who was a liberal columnist for the Atlantic she says quote Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS\nWith ... I think you know this packet at one of the things that who really launched his presidential run on a pack a letter from a crowd of radicalization however has radicalized so many more people than I did I mean the way he talks the waste who\nSay the ... the United states has radicalized more people that ISIS is the response of\nIrresponsible I was just sort of just by not stupid\nAnd it's not true it's true they're going to a ban on what\nHow many I mean how many cancer if you got into an interrogated ISIS folks have you know I wouldn't say that we had like ... yeah they I think the president has far more support or ... is our local hopeful ideology won't you know it's somewhat less than\n... ... later on she ... percent of the you know 'cause she apologized for that comment but still this is ridiculous\nCan I ask a question let me just ask this if the quote Trump supporter can go out and make these type of comments or President Trump himself or let me just because there's this big umbrella now that I'm at the paint the picture I'm painting\nYeah you're right I mean it you know they I mean it but it would just say that it's an invasion and the call that hate speech give me a break from those on the left\n[noise] more as we continue to move along the good to hear from me and Mike is fine and is the senior political reporter for Florida daily dot com there was a it to this story I mean until I rather than Florida daily dot com there was a shooting that took place at a local Republican Party headquarters where was this\nThis was in South Daytona which has ... county which is congressional districts six\nAnd a you know somebody came by it's in a strip mall like many Republican headquarters for each county are came by and fired four bullets right through the window of the building now they haven't exactly narrowed down the timeframe on when this happened yet happen sometime between\nAbout when the last volunteer left on Sunday at four o'clock\nTo win a office workers came on first thing on Monday morning eight o'clock Monday morning so what they're hoping right now\nIs that they can find some kind of surveillance or get some kind of a witness to come forward but somebody is shooting up the loose a county headquarters to make a statement\nIt well now I did not have to ask this question is the headquarters in a crime or in area or what I mean\nWell I mean south Daytona isn't the nicest but no there was no other bullet in any other building in this entire strip mall so I mean it was pretty clear what the intended target was it was Republicans and it's just another example of where we're at politically these days\n... more or less than a week away the university north Florida comes out with the poll I Know some of my Trump listeners are called is fake news Andrew Gillum has been consistent he's up in the poll\nForty nine to ... forty three Rick Scott is losing by one someone called a statistical dead heat forty seven forty six but yet actually moody who is a conservative is over ... all the Democrats forty eight forty Nikki free to map called little pretty much tied\nLess than a week away um what do you think about by the way almost Seventy percent of the respond as black and white support\nRestoring or the voting rights back to balance out there what do you think about that Paul\nWell I mean I think what the poll shows is that we're basically dead even in every race all most statewide\nExcept for the one race where the Democrats have really gotten momentum and that's the governor's race you know we have seen Andrew Gillum everywhere on the campaign trail uh we've seen him perform in the debate\nOr he he and his supporters right now just have a lot more enthusiasm and momentum been run the famous supporters and you know the caller was asking what can you get past\nIf he's elected governor well four years ago the Republicans had a veto proof majority in both the house and the Senate\nDon't have that in the Senate anymore and the governor of the state of Florida has a line item veto so every single project that as an individual house member or Senate member wants could be detail about the governor if he doesn't get a certain policy\nInitiative what he could go ahead\nSo he can set his priorities to let's say for example um you know either pass the tax hike or I'm detailing everything and you can start all over again he has the ability to do that and the house and Senate really can't do anything about it as long as a Democrat stick with that's\nA very good analysis and also to point out that\nYou don't people keep asking me well what what's the worst Gillum could do Republicans maintain the state Senate the state house yet as we talked about what you also brought up line item veto he also gets to appoint taxing authority boards out their water districts as well which will not elected he also can sit back\nAnd appoint Supreme Court justices you can get the economy goodbye when it comes to tort reform\nAnd other things that could be deemed unconstitutional also he can appoint secretary of state and the secretary of education\nAnd and each one of the well water commissioner word for St john's river water management of a district for example up there in Jacksonville and here in Orlando\nThey set their own military right and over the over the past eight years the governor has asked for and gotten out of those water boards that he appointed several large tax cuts for the for the amount that you pay for the water management districts so they can easily pass a tax hike there as well with new uh Andrew Gillum appointee\nMike signing one of the best he is the senior political reporter for Florida daily dot com and here's the latest commercial by Rick Scott and then there's the question I keep asking what's missing in this campaign\nListen this war he comes out and says that he supports forcing insurance companies to cover pre existing conditions what number eight\nI Want to tell you about a family with him and I grew up in public housing rarely saw one of the ... and the mom with two hundred mile charity hospital and getting treatment\nThat wasn't my family growing more insurance companies have a condition okay\nSo now he sounds like a Democrat out there and yet I mean the\nGovernor has had a very good success rate of jobs in the economy here in Florida and I am I I Can't tell you how many people have an email me going wives and the governor talked about this\nAnd I am I I Can't tell you how many people as I've emailed me going why isn't the governor talked about this running against Bill Nelson\nAnd yet because this is the area that he's the weakest on and this was the area that's that ... that internally they've been polling\nAnd it has been hurting people because uh Ninety percent of the people that have insurance habit through a private ensure that they get through their workplace right so let's say the economy is improving and you change jobs and now all of a sudden your new company that you work for their health insurance won't cover eat\nSo whereas it's never been an issue to you before because you're in the private insurance market now all of a sudden it is and you can't even change jobs so it's sort of negates the jobs argument if you can't change jobs because you can't get health insurance at your new job\nSo that's why you you've seen that commercial because he see that it's hurting him in the polls but\nI mean I Would have to agree I Would talk a lot more if I were Rick Scott about jobs in the economy because that's certainly been his strongest point I mean he he should start with\nYou know showing an old commercial of him from the original governor's race in twenty seven ... seven hundred thousand jobs and then show in the one point four million that are at one point six million that he ended up creating\nWow I'm isn't quite possible you could see a Senator Scott and the governor Gillum\nAbsolutely I mean I I like I said I think the only right now the only race that favors the Democrats\nIs the governor's race and and the rest of them are perhaps with the exception of ask Ashli moody or straight toss ups I mean this thing is as close as Florida and the five hundred and thirty seven votes with Bush and Gore I mean this is ... it's down to the wire Governor Scott has been conspicuously\nAbsent from the campaign trail but boy those commercials still run every day all the time\nThe Republicans are leading and some of the Europe or the absentee in early voting I think that's going to probably the margin is going to be made up by the Democrats this past week um what do you see I mean we got record numbers compare the two thousand and four forget to thousands sixteen two thousand and fourteen record numbers in a Democrat and Republican counties what does that say about that\nWell I mean first of all the population is a lot higher than\nIt was four years ago because Florida continues to grow and then second of all these other methods of voting\nAre becoming more popular than ever I mean early voting was sort of a an afterthought or a a niche if you will um you know especially eight years ago but really even to some extent four years ago and now early voting is almost commonplace and it's not just\nThe Democrats that are doing it any more I mean for a long time this was it was really simple formula Republicans voted absentee Democrats vote early that's just not the case anymore as early voting has just exploded in popular\nLet me give you the headline by conservatives the day after the election if Gillum wins hurricane Michael to be blamed for veterans not being able to come out and vote because then I'm not saying it's against them they're just all displaced on Mexico beach in Panama City still\nThat that's not enough margin though I mean and that the number of voters that are in the panhandle I mean yes while they are you know staunchly Republican up in the panhandle there's just not enough of them to make up for the kind of votes that you need to win a statewide\nWell wait twelve counties you can't find Seventy thousand votes which was pretty much the statistical margin in two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nTo twelve counties you can but you can't put but I mean you're talking about a dozen other to do it probably another four hundred thousand voters yeah from from ... so I mean you know that if you're going to find Seventy thousand votes\nGot to be out of where the growth centers are in the state which is St Johns county ... county ... county\nThat's where Republicans have to find their votes if they want to\nGot to find more votes Mike sign and he is the senior political reporter one of the best for Florida daily dot com that's Florida daily dot com good to talk to you\nAll right at I Would be remiss if I didn't bring up fifty nine to ten Clemson over Florida State\nJust demoralized my day thanks so much Everytime Florida State my team gets on the field I actually get on one knee and I protest that's how bad is more as we continue to move along\nNiger report triple to talk tripled to eight to five five I think coming up next Roger the lieutenant governor on the running with Robin Sanders' Jeanette new this is going to join us here and then also talking about the economy plus your calls it tripled to talk tripled to eight to five five talk radio WB obey [noise]\n[noise]\nJust amazing how emotionally invested they are and their tribal is if you need to hear what other people say and then thinking then maybe used\nI Would have gone back and said well wait a second then they have coffee and tea together but I Would have said it very ... and just just to throw back when all the ideas effect right\nKnows most people are a lot of people I Would say most simply do not have that level of civility may lose their minds\nPresident Trump if he would have made this comment would impeachment\nIs there much President Trump if he would have made this comment would impeachment all over the map especially on the issue of race\nTo some of my black listeners out there who I I truly enjoy listening and and or listening to what they call in and they claim that you know part of the family making jelly talk about hey we know blackface back in our day people considered it OK dizzy she endorsed it\nAnd she gets thrown under the buses Roger pointed out where it was the motive behind her she makes a a a an observation and yet Hillary Clinton in an interview this past week listen to this says all black people look alike\nBut anything acquaint okay to fry I adore when do you think about ... or so to start to get to that kind of colder\n[laughter] I Know they all look alike

people that are emailing me at it was tongue in cheek I I agree with it was totally tongue in cheek and I'm not throwing her under the bus all I'm just saying is is that can you imagine if Donald Trump pay me that colleagues\nActually all know he would have never met her we come back from that he's a racist here's the thing people very often defined right or wrong and political circles based upon political affiliation and you're absolutely right conservative could not get away with saying that Hillary Clinton did\nYou have to pay for the endorsement sale [noise]\nShe's talking about bill de Blasio the liberal man from New York\n[noise]\n[noise] I was running on the time [noise]\nI don't I don't like to [noise] cautious politician\nGod yeah see peach I we all do that again that it shouldn't be disqualified because you made a comment like that ... that mean listen Roger you and I listen I'm ... without it I I don't never used the phrase well I have a friend who happens to be black not a\n... I mean you've you've met some of my friends there is some of my best and there are conservative and I was at the same thing joking about those in the in the Asian community exactly yet yo ... well isn't that right and if they haven't said that we ... our cats 'cause they wouldn't ... in at the same as the other one will not really but hey that's racist give me a\nBreak a B.

for tripled to eight to five five\nThere on our news making ... courses do tend to governor Becca and here in the state of Florida she is the first lieutenant governor pickers Cuban I like the family association with Cuban so we are among family ourselves a genetic Munoz of course is a very popular state rep down the Miami area\nHe would tell me you visited I Know you guys have been out there in the panhandle representative Newt as a you know Mexico beach in Panama City a new disasters out there there are still a lot of displaced people out there or even among the voting areas we talk about getting out the vote how is that coming along and that part of the er at the state\nWell first of all good morning and thank you for allowing me to be on the show today it's great to be able to speak with you um we have\nFound a little bit of time over there um I was out there um shortly after the storm and then again\nWith the campaign out we delivered a bunch of hurricane apply a five and and really just devastated by by the the impacts as hurricane Michael over there and that community as you mentioned it is an area that high in ... against the law of property loss of life\nUm and so obviously people are are hurting their their rebuilding picking up the pieces literally and figuratively and do what the governor has done um he made sure that he is providing those individuals with every accommodation possibly a within the law to make sure that those people have access\nTo be able to go and exercise their their their right to vote so um you know folks are early voting is taking place in all of those communities I think what a what we're seeing if people are are still even in the ... the tragedy there's still exciting and our guys to go out and vote\n'em obviously we're uh we're eager to make sure that everyone had that ability and that option given some of the challenges the logistical challenges of getting the um the people to an early voting by\nA bus but we're confident that those folks are they're great American than and they really really are excited about the will to the\nState representative or genetic noon yet the courses do lieutenant governor big on the Republican side running with\nRon just sad just telling me when when you travel and you know I've covered born and raised as you've been a very popular state rep when I'm traveling Tallahassee covering news stories and things like that\nIt's always fascinating debt issues come up and you think want to be discussed or dress in the legislature that never get whether it comes for for a vote or whatever but in this raise when you travel throughout the state\nGive me an issue that you thought that what the media or both sides or whatever you would've liked to you may be in the debate should have been discussed more that maybe didn't get enough attention\nWell I think I'm the debate for obviously they were just two debates or you know less than an hour each wine and so clearly you're not going to be able to cover the gamut of topics that are important to individual\nUm do I think I hit the highlights um I I don't think they really got\nThat on a lot of issues that people care about um whether it's the economy or education or health care I think that those are the issues that really are top of mind um these days because people want to make sure that we protect Florida's future and want to make sure that our economy which is doing so well and you know we've had so much success\nIn terms of lowering the unemployment rate reducing taxes\nReducing burdensome regulations for businesses that are trying to get ahead but we also have challenges and we recognize that\nIn terms of what are the types of jobs whether it's in this community or throughout the state of Florida what are the types of jobs that we want to attract the Florida and what are the industry that currently may not have a large footprint in Florida I'm In rather than the fact that planned to try to bring in New different types of industries that are going to be high skill high\nWage jobs that are really going to provide not just our graduates that are graduating from the university or college it but other people in the workforce today want to have an opportunity for upward mobility\nState representative or out of the Miami area I'm Jeanette ... of course she's also the lieutenant governor packed with congressman rather than just you know for years when you've been in the legislature and we've covered you for some of the publications also besides this radio show when\nYou read I I I've never heard you sit back and go why does the media the media the media having said that being now running for higher office do you think\nThe media the media having said that being now running for higher office do you think the media here in Florida has done a decent job covering the ticket of the centers and Noone yes\nWell I guess it depends on what you're talking about that like at the end of the day the media had a very important role to play on it it important that the media it really looks at this race uncovered that fairly um are there instances where perhaps I don't think the article really captured the essence\nOf what the issue should be or what Ron\nSad or you know what I sat and tell you know I can sit here and blame the media for anything that you know comes our way but I'm not going to do that we're focused on the issues we're focused on Florida voters and we're focused on making sure that they understand the\nStark contrast between ... and Andrew Gillum and what ... what our vision burglary it with our platform for Florida in terms of protecting for the\nFuture and making sure we're able to continue porn\nAnd yeah I think Andrew Gillum platform with his radical left wing ideologies very different and that takes Florida in a completely different direction\nWell man and I know the latest poll numbers that came out on um what Tuesday Morning university north Florida shows you guys down by five or six and\nThings like that but he ... some would say the least somewhat encouraging was the record numbers I mean even the Democrats are some cases have in record numbers compare the two thousand fourteen I don't know if those numbers are doing quite well can maybe compared to two thousand sixteen\nBut yet the Republicans seem to be very much energized by at least this race and they and you can see it every all the time with the president comes out\nYeah I agree I don't think this is going to be your typical mid term I think I'm clearly there's a lot of a sell out their voting voting today for the next week but what I think you're going to see in record numbers you're right I think our Republican base has energized [noise] um I hear it in my interactions that\nAverage every day a ... a lot of people are waiting till election day I don't I don't count so that\nI encourage people to go out and vote early I'm white ... you could do for today but I Know that there's a lot of people especially in my community that really like an election day and so that those voters I encourage them to make sure that they get out early but ah but you're voting on election day I think we're going to the election day surprise\nJeanette noon yes for very popular state rep out of South Florida the Miami area she was the lieutenant governor picked running with Ron\nI say there's a slippery slope [noise] what was the super slow [noise] well you know Justice Kennedy to believe that black people had the right to become citizens so\nAnd he his ideology of originalism is where Kavanaugh and Gorsuch comes in it because they follow his thought process\nBut it's the originalism what issue did they deal with that was a brave and brought up on the questionnaires about slavery\nWell no it was originally about a man who was a free man or a free black man who went to to Virginia and was captured in a turn into a slave and he's who directs guy he's to force free to write and do this and he said that his\nBelief is that the founding fathers never intended for us to have any ... uh equality or never intended to be equal to the white man\nYou mean it was already over that Virginia but I get it\nYeah so at the Missouri I'm right right\nYeah I mean there was a lot to the constitution that would I mean we we originally wanted to have the state legislature for example pick their on US Senators I don't have a problem with people betting for us that are so that's original intents been changed ...\nWell I I mean I understand that but this this particular issue it is a reference to return to us at a time that I I Know you know black people would never read will never accept [noise] but it's it's a return to a time where\nWe didn't have the same right and that's where the thirteenth mimic comes in there and this is I you know I used to think we should get rid of the constitution 'til I spoke to one of my fraternity brothers who used to be on the talk ... talk radio or any of the conservative\nAnd I listen to him and I understand why keeping the constitution is the most important thing for this country\nBut getting ready to the thirteenth amendment without I\nLet me ask let me just to let me let me ask the question I don't know I'm just asking I'm not implying\nThat are you and it doesn't matter whether you go to church or not or you churchgoing individual\nNo I'm a I I don't buy into\nA religion in the way people do I believe that there is a great a creator alright are there is a a a creator of all of them I'm a ... I Believe in ... I'm a I'm a D is I'll put it that\nOkay so do you believe in God or rules in things not all of it comes from technically if you look at like the ten commandments comes from the Bible but there are a lot of people that don't follow the Bible that might even disagree with that does that mean we should eliminate scripture based on some of the other thing that description maybe correct thought\nWell I mean we get a lot of ... a step back for seconds the founding fathers even though they weren't religious the majority of them were ...\nOh there's even though they weren't religious the majority of whom were ... I Would agree with that Thomas Jefferson yes and so it was George Washington these are also members of George Washington where you're going to crush it I don't know if I Would agree that but what I'm saying is is that it was a Mason\nGeorge well big deal George Washington was also baptized with the first Baptist church I mean he was a born again Christian what I'm saying is\nIs that because we may have a disagreement with the Bible does that mean that overall is a ... I mean what are we ever disagreeing with human resources in their hand guy but we don't like the way we dress but overall there to protect your your privileges that your work because they may you may have a disagreement with one does that mean you get rid of the whole hand guidebook\nNo and that's what and that's what I said I I I don't think they did he write the constitution is the smart thing to do I believe that the constitution is a living document is designed to\nA ball just the way we are because things change so getting rid of the constitution I think we have the best documented in the world because our constitution although written originally for one particular group and have the balls chewing crude every considered themselves in America\nYou're smart man you know who Frederick Douglass is\nAbsolutely\nCorrect Frederick Douglass at the speech at the Dred Scott decision says the constitution does all the human inhabitants of this country is the people without going into it says it is fitted to protect and preserve the rights\nOf all people out there he was right\nBut when you take the the ideology of originalism ... recordings of teddy ... what does he he wants to go by what he think the founding fathers founding fathers intended and that was that we were never to be free\nWhat was it was Frederick Douglass wrong when he told me he believes in certain areas of the originalism\nAnd I I don't I don't I mean listen I got to get your folks listen I understand you want to pick and choose you want the constitution to a ball to a twenty first century\nI'm Sorry this is not the ice out here [laughter] okay and and all I'm getting I'm going to be called the older you on hold I ... I promise you I Want to give you plenty of time to make your comments Roger holy ... just put them on hold okay what I'm saying Iraq what Roger jumping all I'm saying is is that let's say that the\nMajority of beliefs that you may have with your wife or husband you agree with him but they're totally dead wrong and a couple of does that mean he just qualify your marriage you know very opposed as not as\nDramatic maybe that's how it goes now says I'm Sorry we're it's very interesting we're beginning alerts all morning that President Trump apparently is going to solve the bumper I buy a ticket of order revoked the citizenship of uh of children born in America if their parents are us citizens are here legally\nThat's not that it probably needs to be done by ... I think the good of course you're going to return that yeah I mean executive order I mean we didn't like when Obama's I'm just saying I'm ... ... ... ... let's go to George George is ... you know the audience and apology George because there is an amendment here locally about J E S tell the audience would that amendments about\nYeah basically as a straw ballot if it's not holding a law but it tells the city council and to a\nWhether they can sell it or not at ten percent of the time chunks of it and I am against selling any of Jay because they're putting three hundred million dollars a year into the city budget and we sell it then we're gonna have to make up at three hundred more taxes\nThat you could get two billion dollars according to ... I I don't know this I'm just saying the quarter somebody asked me if you could get you a million dollars if you could just live off the interest alone that would be about why\nI don't know if you want to talk and he told me three or four percent I guess [noise]\nThree percent of that and then the problem is I Know what they're gonna do with the money they're going to spend an ally ... project and they're not ... off the debt that so that's what aggravates me now in that three hundred million a year it's going to leave this community\nAnd the first place they shouldn't ... shouldn't have a set up the jaguars with one owner they should have had us buy stock in it and then the people who own their own now still could come in and made just as much money if we give them special deals et cetera\nAnd that's what gave us this big chunk of\nDebt from the better Jackson Plan so\nI Want I Want an independent lawyer on if you can get one he'll tell us if\nWe don't deal if that were real amendment and and we didn't vote for we have the original city charter can they still failed Jay with original city charter high I have a feeling they can't to other quick things Rutherford one\nAbout reaching out to Democrats needed a mailer right and runs the center is reaching out to Republicans again and again he's got a vote it goes on Fox you know he goes on a kind of\nYeah he he was I got to get going he's going to stop going on Fox and go on TALK radio by the way we would have a lawyer and a lobbyist by the name of why men who who's running for state house but why Mitt who won't come on\nSo we can I can bury will ask that question more have you on hold your calls coming up next I promise you right here on TALK radio W.

[noise]\nGranted citizenship I have no problem here if you're here and a green card legally right the problem is it's when you come here\nBoth parents are illegal\nAnd somehow that makes up for legal citizenship that it it flies in the face of watching\nYeah what a lot of people talking about President Trump says what Roger as of this morning about an hour ago they weren't going to sign an executive order in what is it the birthright citizenship and\nRide for those who were legal with some people called anchor babies now coming from primarily Latin America interestingly there's an industry not a big one but people in China who get pregnant and then he come to America to have their babies just because they want their children to have US citizenship and I believe dual citizenship and trying to the same time\nI'm sure it's a big issue will be discuss I mean we can discuss it today about twenty minutes left but we'll probably talk about it tomorrow Daniel hey good morning you're on WB obey\nThey got a whole number ... came out I mean we have to bring back two years ago and um\nThey were showing Hillary Clinton twelve points that went in Florida by six points I don't remember one whole shirt Trump won in Florida and ultimately obviously he did so I I I'm really curious about these poll girlfriend has been polled twice and in general in the old ...\nTo be here in New Orleans and the questions are put in there\nI had let me let me ask you this question to poll showed Marco Rubio winning in two thousand sixteen he won the polling no I'm just playing devil's advocate here the poll numbers showed Ron disadvantages by double digits the majority of polls over a Adam putting them he won\nA let me see what else do the poll numbers show that Caldwell is going to win a Ashley Moody was going to win the defenders was going to win the primary yeah\nYeah I Do some of them there but I think on certain key races at the end you know in the oh is that it will ... some of the questions the favor one candidate over together\nWe're going to find out next week island I tend to think that the reason why Trump bugs poll numbers were down prior to the electorate gets there where you have basically because of some of the off the mark or of statements that were made by Trump people were embarrassed to say ... to go to they were going to vote formula deposit louder\nAnd louder heard from governor Wilder yeah ha ha ...\nYears ago ... and another thing is is we're older trends and the ... the orders that a Republican governor for two decades\nThat's right and you know what that was that white early Christ was unfairly ...\n[laughter] good used to have these T shirts with ...
