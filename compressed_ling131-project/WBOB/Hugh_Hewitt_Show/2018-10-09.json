a ... who is abortion probably going to see some restrictions on it I think probably eventually maybe ... of the state level and depending on the state you live in\nBut um you know as far as voting rights with something that I think it is there any basis in fact the matter they're just trying to get people worried for no reason\nMitch McConnell Senate majority leader says Kavanaugh is just the boost that Republicans needed in two thousand and Eighteen [noise]\nAh they get to show your most important thing I've been involved in my career\nSo if you want to have a long term and bug and obviously all of us would like to do the [noise] the single most significant way to go do it is ... ... what I think that's a dumb for us is the kind of adrenaline\nShot and we had not been able to figure out how to achieve in any other way\nI mean can you imagine that the Republicans on everything and they're still looking for that adrenaline shot because they're seeing that couldn't get their act together on the issue of impeachment whereas it at right now the Democrats may be moving away from that Senate Democrat from Delaware Chris Coons\nAnd that is the Democrats on the Senate side are starting to sidestep talk about impeaching capping off on the court\nAre just less than a month away from an election folks who feel very strongly a one way or the other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote and participate [noise] um\nThere's only ever been in one justice that's been engaged and I think talking about it at this point I'm isn't necessarily hailing us in moving forward\nAs we continue to go along with the midterms now again less than a month so way will the Kavanaugh will is pumped up to get people out there and vote\nPublic affairs senior VP with the signers group common Reed says yeah there is going to be a better turnout but Roger he kinda says that you said it's not so much going to get the better turnout which it is but who's more angrier yeah\nWell I I think is as far as people like Congress and now they're out there would be the chair of the Judiciary Committee coming in and talking about impeaching a cabinet already and that's a talking point that'll be good for Republicans on the campaign trail because or mine voters\nRight and that's a talking point that Lincoln for Republicans on the campaign trail because or mine voters what's at stake and what you're really seeing is that the intensity level and the Democratic version in the Democratic side was already there is now being pulled off on the other side and the question that no one knows the answer to it which I can be angrier\nYeah which site is going to be angry I mean I Wonder if again there's this translator to thirty days from now 'cause everybody says it a month of an election can change things I don't know when Republicans were pretty pumped up after Brock Obama won that in slow down the Dems seems to be pumped up I don't know if this has got to slug it out if\nIf the definitions angry I think probably Democrats are the most Matt right now obviously Kevin all he was on the court and Republicans are happier but I think that they are probably some\nAnd they're able to win what does that say that\nDoes that say that maybe they don't need a proper message I mean again the Republicans have done it as well and sometimes attacking your opponent I understand it as part of the political process\nBut if their message according to what Roger ... I think a lot of people would agree with you Roger then again you've got the Midwest with them probably would have already agree with Trump Baby on the union in trade blue collar being may not want to admit it but the Democrats like that\nThen they may not agree with him other states like the east coast as far as maybe from Virginia and north and also in the west coast from California to Washington state but you've got that flyover country met again the Clintons and the the a lot of the Democrats ignored or two thousand sixteen will they northern ma two thousand Eighteen but even here in Florida and the question has\nTo be asked is the pumped up enthusiasm by the dams enough to get them out even though the ... at least you point out the message on the economy seems maybe it's not over the map maybe they want to have single payer health care maybe they want to have Medicaid expansion is you know here in Florida\nI I think it's going to come down to who wants to more mid term elections that are all about turnout and will do Republicans see this was an opportunity to continue the conservative agenda of the country in the state is going through toward toward do they want to the Democrats took over stay home and not be as concerned as much\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell listen to what he says about the confirmation is a boost of course for the Republicans in two thousand and Eighteen but ... says about how it is a major boost for conservatives when it comes to judicial philosophy [noise]\nI think it was showing the most important to have been involved in my career so if you want to have a long term and obviously all of us would like to do the [noise] the single most significant way to do it is [noise] to show up or you know\nCan I jump right there hold on a per second haven't really heard and and I think Britain him has been all over the map on this that one of the areas where Democrats have been very successful hasn't been at the polls but it's been at the courts exact with whether same sex marriage I'm not saying you have to agree with it or not I'm just giving you the issue of same sex marriage\nAbortion certain areas of gun control\nAt a lot of people are really thinking that was the real problem with the with Kevin on the court\nOkay well whatever whatever you say but but you just heard Mitch McConnell says the lasted victory is winning the courts and you can you give somebody the left can with the courts I guess maybe what he's saying is is to block a lot of that you happy defended by plenty more conservative judges that the court\nExactly defend the constitution by putting people there who believe in it\nBut I think they should go on for us is the kind of adrenaline\nShot and we had not been able to figure out how to achieve than any other\nWay every ... you got to Senate majority leader of the Republicans saying that we ... we we couldn't find any this year we had to get an ... an adrenaline shot mhm what do you have the economy going for you\nUm education of vouchers as a top cherished you I mean you and I talked about this a lot of listeners why haven't these guys talked about the you know all the judges on a lower level which will help prevent a lot of some would say judicial activism why did it take Brett Kavanaugh would they barely I mean folks\nOne vote is what they won by yeah they barely won and this is the journalist shot that the Republicans needed for supposedly for two thousand Eighteen\nA lotta people voted for Donald Trump bad because they were concerned about the social direction the country was going through or think about the Baker in in in Denver, Colorado being forced to make a gay wedding cake in rioting or there are people who are concerned about whether or not that's going to be normal and America\nHas you know Tallahassee\nMayor Democrat Andrew Gillum\nWho is well in the ... the Mason Dixon pulled pretty much tied but he's been leading all the polls out there he's pumped his models let's bring it home okay hey I like just good football was bringing home out there\nHe's a big promoter of Medicaid expansion Newt Gingrich was on Fox News Chris Wallace he said you know this whole thing about Medicaid expansion you could throw a bomb under the bus for promoting it and some of the Republicans but let's be honest here he says Newt\nAnd all of these guys getting are treatments as a people just love free money\nQuestion because that is one of the big concerns under the President Obama and the Democrats expanded Medicaid coverage people\nThat weren't previously covered millions of people got it under their this while it is true that that does it doesn't cost medicated slows the wrote a rate of growth of Medicaid some people who now having coverage eventually lose coverage and in the states that\nAnd people who are now having coverage eventually would lose coverage and in the states that didn't expand Medicaid there's a tremendous concern that they're going to be stuck in an inferior position how do you make\nThem whole well both sides underwhelming by governors who love free money\nYou have a lot of donors and say oh we want more of this money Ninety percent\nOf The Cosby picked up by the feds for the expanded part of Medicaid\nOr which by the way I actually discriminated against for example Americans with disabilities 'cause they only get sixty two percent of their funding some states that actually ... the game more able bodied I can I Would say look at what Mary may who did in in Maine where they passed reforms that said if you're an able bodied adult\nThen you ought to be required to work if you have no children Medicaid has expanded dramatically and does owns it was never designed for and I think the American people would support reforms that had work requirements attached to people who are able bodied adults\nHere's a question do you think Andrew Gillum\nWill support that for those of you listening\nBecause the Dems again the\nMinimum wage for Fifteen bucks now they talked about there are no symptoms for smaller businesses out there whether the Roger whether they have three employees are fine there is no exemptions what about the same thing with Medicaid expansion\nIs this what we're going down or they're not going to put any able body work requirements on his nowhere because the last time they promoted is in governor Rick Scott flip flop on this issue the Senate Republicans here in Florida supported right some requirements\nBut yet is is just a free rein for Medicaid expansion for all is is pretty much gonna turn into a welfare state here in Florida\nMy speaking as if we do have Medicaid expansion for all you know a single payer I Can't see how putting the work requirement out of gives who picks up the tab the hospitals they show up at the hospital they have to be treated under what did he have a work requirement\nHeal the get it I mean you are showing for do you pay into the system let's just say you're not working suppose the person just doesn't want to work for whatever reason you don't get to medicate expelled and they go to the hospital and guess who\nTreat gang and guess what their money they can take out other pockets somebody's always got a couple of hours left around to All right how much they mean for this more as we continue to move along talk radio WB obey\nIf

they want to know more about your candidates folks got to get involved let me listen I'm not saying this to be rude I I I Am grateful every day for this radio show God gets all the credit but some of that you need to focus on some of these issues do look at who gets an endorsement\nPresident Trump endorsed uh somebody that's great still check them out Hillary if you're the left well Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will still check out your candidate that's all I'm saying exactly I mean it Roger like come on this morning show we put on all the news but some of you have to make the decisions yourself\nMore as we continue to move along the lines of report triple to talk triple to eight to five five let's get on with the news as we continue to move along\nThat one of the big issues again what is the laugh is who's more pumped up when it comes to the election and two thousand and Eighteen majority leader Senator Mitch McConnell says the cabin all the boost that Republicans need it [noise]\nAh they get the most important to have been involved in my career so if you want to have a long term and bug and obviously all of us would like to do the [noise] the single most significant way to do it in short order cook but I think they should go on for us\nIs the kind of a drill a shot and we had not been able to figure out how to achieve in any other way\nI mean what is the same when you've got the economy going you know you've got\nA things and moving around the Reagan you've got a deregulation you got things that are moving while in many markets while you know price wages are up I'm not prices but wages are up a inflation someone is in check interest rates a little bit high but you've got a business consumer sentiment at an all time high out there\nAnd the guy who almost lost because of the Republicans possibly some patients couldn't get their act together and write and yet believe it or not in a trial around this may be the biggest if there is a right away but we don't know that folks the biggest thing is Brett Kavanaugh\nYou they say that they're happy good times don't draw people to the polls it's fear and anger but drives people to the polls and uh after seeing what happened to Brett Kavanaugh there are a lot of Republicans who may have stayed home on election day this year are now going to be going out to vote and the voter turnout is expected to be pretty high on both\nSides from the I own a college professor gene Zeno says the Dems have a messaging problem but she says the saving grace is there still pumped up about the election\nAll at this point I don't think they should they came back in ... whatsoever I think what kind of kind of has a long meeting for Dale is offering the country a positive message going forward\nPocket money at Carnegie and what they're doing I I think they could do much better job and doing that\nAnd it's a perennial problem of messaging for Democrats are dying can be the leader of the party so he gave up here and I forget where there is a lot of energy out there can be handled properly that the big question\nNow she says there's a lot of energy out there and that possibly possibly could be a deflection the Republicans may need easy energy on their side but according to the senior vice president of the ... public affairs column and read says the voter turnout maybe is who is more angrier\n[laughter] well I think that it is as far as people like congressman neither out there who would be in the chair of the Judiciary Committee coming in and talking about impeaching a cabinet already and that's a a talking point that will be good for Republicans on the campaign trail because or mine voters what's his take\nAnd what you're really seeing is that the intensity level and the Democratic version in the Democratic side was already there now be equaled off on the other side and the question that no one knows the answer to it which I just got to be angry or\nCan I ask a question to the audience out there and let me ask you a question Roger okay when you go knock okay let's when when somebody knocks on your door politically\nAnd they talk about whether it's from the laptops dire of impeachment or let's say you get a Republican Party were pumped up ... would you go to the anger at let's say you get the anger Democrat he's just ... or she picked whoever about everything\nWho do you think the good will resonate with just out of curiosity\nVoter will resonate ... anger more positive I Would think right now the Republicans are probably more positive about a lot of things the economy is doing but\nI mean if you if you weren't into if you are an undecided voter are you going to resonate more with somebody knocking on your door trying to get your vote right\nAre you are you going to relate to me just say that we use that word or you can only somebody who's more angry come knocking on doors more positive [laughter] gosh that's a tough one oh gosh let me ask me ask you All right when you go to a restaurant el ... you're right because you never get me neither do I write well who gets more attention\nOn the person that's nice of the person that's complaining\nAbout their own and I was praying moderate side never complained at a restaurant up go yeah just one of those it never too late to the server out but I Want my ex Hooper tastes like ... but ... but I'm saying but who gets more the tension\nIt's it's the one who's very kind and then I think so yeah I I think well yeah that's what works for me I don't know I I'm not I'm at the gate retired when I when I go okay I'm just because this is a question like to ask you listen to them\nYou out there listening right now who is it the more positive approach that's going to garner let's say the Republican I mean I'm sure there's some pretty positive Democrats out there we can find it but they're angry and the Republicans were angry with Obama was in the White House will just be out of state okay\nBut if you're an undecided voter or let's say that you as a listening Democrat right now or Republican or independent\nIf are are you more in a positive for example other Republicans more in a positive note right now they pumped up\nOr the Democrats positive that they're going to win or they positive gonna win because they're so negative how do you like that\nDot com and there are fairly from this morning show mirror courage says yeah I hear a lot of stuff in the background Roger a lot of stuff in the background so I'm just his it on my end no it's not um I just want to make sure to Maryland to curry says that what we see going on with the crime that it's\nMostly it's pretty much under control\n[noise] yeah I mean I'm hearing a lot in the background\nYeah I can still hear
