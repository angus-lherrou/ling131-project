E. D. strip lines in there and I mean it's ... it's like being at a football game\nYeah and uh\nI walked out the other morning and had to rent the boat because it looked dirty and it was all bugs I mean it was just covered from stem the stern on with with bugs but there's something I'd I'd found the other day that I got to look up I think it's called a Cuban tree frog\nBut that places loaded with them I mean we've got one of my ... no no no and this one has spots on it like leopard spots during the invasive species they eat our our frogs and they bark\nAnd so these we've got one that's probably as big as a cell phone my cell phone right here out there I've never seen the tree frog about big yeah I don't know about that and he uh\nHe leaves like little dog remains around and I will say well what is it accurate I was trying to figure it out there I saw it and I was like look at the size of that thing yeah but I think\nThat I think they're becoming more prevalent around the house because of the lights that are on with all the bugs that are there\nIs I get on to the grocery store for more than ... you know they're nasty yeah so but I mean we've got regular tree frogs and everything else out there and tons of lizards I mean that's ... that's ... the ecosystem is friendly around the house because they're all healthy yeah frogs in the first thing that will tell you [noise] but um\nYeah it's nice to have and that thing out there and but yeah you're right you've got to make sure you rent those things good and ours being as a slopes set up the slope and bury my eyes to yeah I always leave the hose on for a little bit and try to flush all that out most of the time we wash the boats outside of it that's\nIt was on for a little bit and try to flush all that out most of the time we wash the boats outside of it does you know that I Would I drive ins and yeah yeah\nSee I always watch blind at the ramp but the is to set some more on that go there the one more on leaves the the hose out into the driveway yeah so the other set of morals runs over the ...\nYeah so you can't screw it on your motor so here's one lab replaced myself twice out there I just take my own house when I go sisters and yeah it's just it's ridiculous that it's nice to be able to do it there because it's drive by the time I get home\nYeah you know so we got\nWe have these pumps prayer set up and they and I have one that's half bleach half water with two big scores of dawn in it and that's the one we use to clean you know the top side and the whole\nThat I have another one which is um ... gas it and it's two scoops per gallon of water and you put a couple of scores of dawn and that when you spray the whole down when you get that brown stain you spray it down it's gone instantly\nI did my ... and ... says ... snowball and some toilet would\nLater this but it's a it's a powder form in six Ninety nine ... for\nA box and then makes like eight gallons and I mean we go through it and every day I mean I use it on my butt every day for Russ stains that takes out some of the things that don't come off now we using crab\nIs like the worst thing you can have a boat because it's gray when it goes on and then it becomes like nuclear [laughter]\nAnd then when you bleach it it turns to yellow and then you have to pressure wash it off you know I'm seriously considering doing that um\nThat great that gray water and I tell a gray gray water comes out of the\nCrab when you you got a crab and it gets on the ...\nIf you wipe it off is really easy to just like they're All right then but if it's if that son drives it like you're talking about yeah oh [laughter] you almost need a wire brush to get it all\nI'm a ceramic my deck this year this winter and I've seen that the ceramic housing they do on the ... you can literally throw blood everything on it walk away let a bake in the sun for two days come back and just read or write off no kidding what the head of ... of expensive but\nThe average guy who uses or boat it's I don't think it's important to them because they can clean it but when you're on it every day 'cause I mean you can do the same thing with um [noise] ... ... you take what are you actually cleaner but really good with the wax I'll ever pressure wash it off and it works pretty good too but\nYou have to continually do it when you use the\nThe ceramics or if you dawn yes as that that done is a good degrees are in it and it washes good without using a whole lot but it destroys ways yeah well\nThat's what my detail I was telling me when I had the boat and the ... what are you doing just use a wet share me I was like\nCan't use the legendary other with all the yard and stuff yeah you know and people's black sold shoes and ... you know I mean magic race are still the best thing on the planet I mean it will take anything off your boat\nYeah but you know it's just like times you've got to get on your hands and knees yeah and you know they don't have they don't have one almost no I'm\nSo especially with my back I'm ...\nI'm getting up there too you know that's why I keep looking at bay boats now I'm like man that gun oh look at that see [laughter] you know it's but yeah it's it's it's one of those battles she has that I have Leon does I mean are much get trashed\nData like using grab just for that reason yeah well I'm going to build a sticker\nOn my boat that says one that has a slash through it no bananas and the other is going to be\nNo Cheetos and the cheese [laughter] as that die there you saw there and won't come off either but real quick that ceramic cutting you put it on your Christians and it's my last up to a year and the Christians will stay and I said I'm going to\nGet into a section and\nYou can do whatever you want for chopping up fish and crabs and well I mean you're going to have one really nice section of the ones that all the time like a neighborhood because\nEven if you do the\nThe the one section whenever you get a cast of crap [noise]\nI mean there's going to be pieces of it fly you know you've voted I mean it's yeah using a crab is it's all over the ...\nThe thing about it is is if you don't get it all out and just today you know [noise]\nEspecially as hot as in this year you know right\nIn just one day you can tell that you didn't get it all out\nAnd I came over to the money and he says get right here get right here so you know I got about twenty foot from him in there and we were catching two two and a half pound mangroves at the ... that's awesome either stay were mobsters for being insured I mean I Know the catch them six seven eight pounds off shore\nBut for them to be in Georgia and we did that for about two weeks and then ... their they disappeared will I've never seen him like that again\nThey typically uh when they get to be about Fifteen\nWell I've never seen him like that again\nThey typically uh when they get to be about Fifteen inches thick offshore and that's why we never get big ones you know I bought a twenty foot ...\nAnd the thing is like a noodle and it is so fun you can almost laugh yourself death match in those snapper is because we use it All right down the rocks and you have the broader the forty five degree angle on the tips in the water yeah it is hilarious\nMy God it's like a twenty five dollar rod no real or nothing in when Keith my daughter and I do it it's better to have somebody but debate on cause such a pain in the next twenty feet long that's bigger than my boat yeah alone along a land ... I'm probably sixteen feet and you know so that that's plenty\nYeah because when that thing if you get a cheap it on it and it doubled over oh it was on the sheep and they'd really do the lower yet does the ... it'd be hard to get the getting in India I mean it's a\nIt's a noodle but you know the reason I bought it I was fishing at a what's the park\nYou drive underneath the bridge over the past you cannot you any good at offering their words yeah in ... George\nAnd I was fishing before I had a boat I was there we used to go there quite a bit and these two guys caught a sheep ad on about a Fifteen foot ... and then they were laughing so hard to they couldn't even catch the fish and and I said man I got to get one of those and I would recommend anybody that\nYou know just wants to have a just a crazy amount of fun those telling me up dirt cheap they're stupid and oh my God are they fun can't you get 'em at different um\n[noise] has to that's a strength or whatever I don't I don't know probably\nYeah they they make 'em or you pop still likes to do it um I forget what he calls them bowed to tell us copying a calm came polls right but I think you use a little small fly on them down around green coat on the walls you can pop and catch his big pan fish and ... ... ... and stuff like that at night and we used to use\n... but it was actually gain poles or were speckled portray shouldn't have been really bad you know where you just ... yeah in a hole in the little iPads\nThe grain busters is what they're called yeah busters and the Japanese have 'em over thirty feet long yeah they get in on those things\nBut I don't know about that but you'd have to use the freaking Lynch to get it out no they take 'em in flip them into the boat yeah I Know there are these guys on shore yeah no I'm just saying they make 'em over there whether there'll be out on the commercial boats and they're linking them into but it'd be\nA lot of them do that on video yeah I was ... showed just flip over in a in a pop off the land and\nYou know they have no hum barbs on their hooks yeah land others are just flipping them in the boat\nAnd then they also usually have those automatic when she does have you seen those chemical and they'll just flipping right in and pop it right back out there and ... yeah I mean it's it's unreal how they do that I mean they get in the ... that they just may unloading the Buddha\nYou know this crazy how they can just flip 'em right off of the problem right off the land like that\nI use a I have some ... there's a barb\nOn the outside and I bought 'em at the strikes on sale which is going on this weekend that's true they are\nThey were just you know they're just cheap and they are the right size and then realized the barbed wire on the outside ... and they're real wide and they use them for slip corks 'cause you know when he getting in trout if you're catching\nLimit not you know small trout but once we get a big when you get them off and those things you just turn up the fish falls off is fantastic you had to be on your game you've got to keep a dateline yeah I've got a bunch of fish on him and you can get them off their super good gumbo got to make some to replace tremble hooks on

seven three\nHad this question several times during the week and the question basically was Hey Joe you did a trust from me and my wife several years ago\nAnd now we're getting divorced and what happens with this trust\nWell the answer is you have a joint trust in a if you get divorced and there's some division of the assets which would normally be typical\nThen you create your own separate trust\nSo then you each would have a trust with whatever assets you leave the marriage with you can now put into your trust\nSo a pretty simple\nYou know you walk away with with assets I had a question yesterday from Texas actually a Texas attorney who's calling me and his clients who are Texas residents owned a piece of property\nIn Florida and they were\nGoing to get divorced in the very near future and they want it to a divide the probably the husband was going to do the property to the wife\nAnd the Texas attorney was asking me questions about how to do that so I said well you actually in Florida most of the time we divide the property up pursuant to the divorce or after the divorce happens not we don't buy the property to someone one or the other ... you know prior to the force\nSo\nAnd another situation where a couple were\nGetting married in one of them on the house and they wanted\nTo know how to or what should they possibly do on other choices is the deed to house too if you want it to automatically go to the surviving spouse or no children in this\nCircumstance the most logical thing to do with probably create a joint trust with the property and joint names and\nMake it a little bit easier the ... the problem could be there was a divorce and the proper you've already defeated away half of the interest in the house things like that if you have a

spousal rights so an example\nWould be you get married you moan to house for a long time just seen your name and now you get married you have children from a ... marriage you\nHave documents that you didn't even change uh till after marriage that leave everything to your children I\nGuess what your spouse has some rights spouse actually has a right to live there for life and your spouse has a right to even sell the house and take out the proceeds so there are definitely some a spouse or rice\nYou need to be concerned about and plans for you can take care of those are the pre or post marital agreement based\nOn where you are in the marriage and there's definitely things you need to plan for to take care of those type of circumstances\nIn in a marriage\nIn a marriage they were

eight seven seven\nNine four three nine six seven three and a few clients this week that had young children so the question becomes how do you play in your state and leave assets\nTo miner or they are good ways to do that\nTechnically it's going to cause a hardship to be able to leave of absence directly to minor because then you might be forcing the guardianship proceeding through the courts so if you have a living trust you can leave assets to a minor inside and living trust\nAnd then the trust either you choose to manage the assets until the child becomes whatever age you want to distribute the assets and\nThat's much better way to go if you have insurance or a retirement accounts you\nCould the beneficiary could be your spouse versed in the trust seconds and it would control of the essence of getting into whatever age you want it to select the child to receive the asset or we have a call\n[noise] [noise] hello Hi wasn't conquered any business in law I had the ... for one thing

vehicle on Florida Florida but registered the vehicle here my brother in Ohio [noise]\n\nI'm probably not because if you are resident in Florida and you worked in Florida for example I actually know police I've heard him Cleese going in the parking lots of people who work and if you have an out of state license plate but you're working at a Florida company\nYou get a ticket\nI think he got stopped by policemen and they ask questions and determine that you are Florida resident\nIn you have out of state license plates there's a there's a time period you have to have I think is ... is either ten or twenty days I think you have to register and get a new license plates in men registers the car\n... water my brother's name or something to tide [noise]\nThen you just like borrowed the car yeah\nSo I if I were him I wouldn't do that because if you had an accident he'd get sued because they always do the owners of a car so yeah and that creates other legal circumstances in issues to
