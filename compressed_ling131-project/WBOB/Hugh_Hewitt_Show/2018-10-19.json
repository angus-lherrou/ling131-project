B. B. let's get into it folks the latest poll numbers again we want to track these things are that they changed who's benefitting who is it not benefiting the latest from the cook Political Report David Wasserman more\nRural or Hispanic areas like the Central Valley California south Texas even parts of South Florida we're not seeing the same types of numbers pop for Democrats\nFacing the blue way may not to I mean it may go throughout the rest of the country but it may not really have much of an impact he says maybe possibly who knows you're in Florida\nFlorida oh we're not seeing the same types of numbers pop for Democrats so yes I still think Democrats are the clear favorite for the house majority but they're also dangerously close to getting their clocks cleaned in the Senate if some of these rural states start really breaking heavily for Republicans in\nThe rural states oh boy who knows what may happen here some of the latest poll numbers also out there especially when it comes to the economy box business news Maria ... aroma\nThat health care the economy and President Trump on the top at first I thought it was at the turn elections in three weeks away now majority leader Mitch McConnell tells Reuters Champaign Urbana can't repeal after the midterm saying quote\nIf we have to completely start over we would do it but that depends on what happens in a couple of weeks were not satisfied with the way Obamacare is working and I don't think that every\nNight so the Democrats say that they want to go along and been tried to push for another vote in the next couple of weeks trying to embarrass the Republicans not wanting to support\nPreexisting conditions and you got McConnell's as you put us back up to try for another vote you know he may just get it you know it's so interesting says early on a ... you get what I'm saying yeah you know the Cain was the one that voted against that he's no longer around uh haven't rest his soul and if you get fifty three fifty more\nRepublicans you may see a a pretty good repeal I'm not seeing a full repeal repeal going further of Obamacare case could backfire on the ... no go ahead what are we going to say I\nWas going to say that it's so interesting was really doesn't have a whole lot necessarily to do with trying to improve the health of the American people but it's political posturing by putting it on the up for vote at this time next year and\nA bit but could you not say would help out the financial out that the American people that have to pay the mandate higher deductible and higher premiums shows that's a good point when it comes to the late ... says reporter jobless claims again Roger this was almost\nThis is becoming mundane as it is just becoming a repetitive will we keep seeing the sequel\nThe economy's doing so well Roger I knew you were reported this before a fifty year low again when it comes to job claims but when you listen to the Democrats with a couple of weeks left before the November midterms they're saying this is bogus not everybody's feeling the economic boom says former Hillary Clinton advisor\nAdrian ... and really failing to economic and down the line we've got a planet right of course\nThat not everybody feeling that people are council stagnant wage crowd\nAnd they're not feeling from their own pockets I felt like you know that's the tax\nPlan that was obviously a an ad for corporations and not for a crime far away and not everybody in the early last year I got when they claimed that the stock market out what the average family not fail or failing economic them is why a lot of voters are going to forget what caught\nYour news guy did you think the average family is feeling the economic boom I mean you get what you have covered by talking to\nYou know there's always going to be some who who don't necessarily are are a bit offended by the economy but overall things are a lot better than they would be otherwise it up to say otherwise was probably just a little dishonest would expand the tulips you see some of the she's probably obviously trying to get votes for Democrats\nThat's true but former communications director for the Trump\nCampaign presidency in two thousand sixteen Brian lands and says wait a second how can the Democrats talk down the economy especially when it you know middle class income workers out their windows of them think that again the question is will then if that's the case why consumer confidence at an all time high\nSling a consumer confidence I mean that that's the consumer that's the voter that the taxpayer consumer confidence is at a record high that's not an accident that's because they feel strongly about their own pocket books has them on the\nMinimum wage increase in a lot of time\nSo they got into this debate about hey well wait a second I mean nobody's feel the economic boom we have an increased the minimum wage or even talk about health care\nAlso included a dream now Ron former Hillary Clinton advisor and Fox Business news one of my favorite digging McDonald says wait a second what do you mean you want a federal increasing the minimum wage Roger would you have reported how Democrats say they will try to push this when companies are already implementing these without government involvement\nRelies on the minimum wage increase in a lot of people want to say a federal minimum\nWage or we know that wages\nAre up three percent need the\nFederal government doesn't need to raise the minimum wage because of the businesses are doing it on their own Amazon just raises minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or an\nExtraordinary ... in terms of number one Ninety percent of American workers solve bigger paychecks because Scott\nNinety percent of people earlier this year started keeping more of their own money and their pay tax and then in terms of wages and the minimum wage people in terms of their future they don't strive to working minimum wage job they might have\nIn terms of their future they don't strive to working at minimum wage job they write for more than that\nRoger that's an interesting debate I Will concede um that that maybe not everybody is feeling the wages that proclaims to be like they've automatically seem sky rocketed wages no you've had two and a half almost three percent growth in wages than what we've seen stagnant over the last ten years that when it comes to the Bush years as well in the last year and the Obama years okay\nUm but then again the numbers are there but if that's the case is not again or you or other people not you personally are other people not feeling it that's going to be an interesting take on the November election post\nThere are a lot of people we talked about before who benefit from a minimum wage hike who are not making the minimum wage for example there are certain union contracts with say OK are starting salary for this particular class of worker\nIssue that something you've actually said repeatedly you know after the numbers after the what happened down and supported as tragic as it is people who were stronger gun control advocates that usually wanes away if there's not been a shooting recently and that so surprise to anyone tried to bring it up at this point probably big waste of money\nAgain the gun control issue plan to be a big issue over the next couple of weeks when it comes to campaign spending and that's NBC's Nicole ... says the problem with a GOP in those in Florida and the n._r._a. is that they are is out of step with gun members in Florida and it shows that the GOP if they don't do anything about it they got blood on their hands\nIn a coma and being part of the political party have faced\nBy the n._r._a. the n._r._a. lobby that's out of that but the vast majority of its support for commonsense gun owners are for things like ... gun owners background check but I Want to see something Democrats\nAre for gun control are\nDoing more for the mentally ill that Republicans\nAre doing more for the mentally ill [laughter]\nEver ever ever conversation about gun control in part in a wake up and realize they have flat on its hands you know\nI'm kind of curious if you wanted to have a little fun with Bloomberg's money and he's got plenty of and why not spend money and then they gory Scott for passing gun control bill back in what was it in March of this past year where I Would raise the age from Eighteen to Twenty one but part of what I'm saying I see that we don't get cheap part\nAnd parcel of it though is they don't want to give the Republicans have credit because they want to get Democrats elected in addition to whatever Reno pap they're pursuing to try to bring about gun safety\nYou know let's bring this down even more tool to your local level for those of you that are listening like for example um\nDo you have Orlando big primary at Tallahassee big primary Jacksonville a big crime area the only way here's our with our affiliates one of them use for Jack Kemp justice and currently peel were the local leaders after a shooting takes place for example in cities like Orlando cities like Jacksonville\nThe attitude is it okay do we need more police know the attitude by certain local leaders is listen to this report they want more gun control\nIn local activist or calling for justice in the wake of this tragedy leaving to mend groups including my dad's a justice coalition to name a few they marched outside city hall asking by the way those are big pro gun control groups just to let you know they will find a way find a way to make sure that this never happens again\nPolitical activists here at city hall from my voice their concerns that boundary thing than violent now at that time local leaders crane change people say\nAcademics are hoping this city will listen to their concerns fewer names will be added to not bad stored\nWill be in the city council meeting on Wednesday night and you know\nRoger I think when you've got a even elections going into next year you got a lot you quite a few cities plan to have off year elections yes even in two thousand nineteenth South Florida also in Jacksonville I think this was going to be between the mayor's race\nI think in city council races this was going to be an issue of crime but also how do you perceive the take care of a crime right the mayor in Jacksonville says we need to spend more money or the sheriff said sorry it's going to do more than writing a check\nYou've got Democrats say that maybe we need more gun control this is going to be I think a big big erase you by the way schools for school board school safety bill this year that was also a big\nIssue and it's just come out in the Jacksonville area of the schools are now implementing a metal detectors and all the public schools that is going to be rolling out real soon as one of the safety measures when it\nComes to the Florida governor's race there\nIs what is called the Florida insider poll that this was done by a consultants lobbyists out there according to the recent numbers that's pretty much taken place and you guys ready for this they say that a Andrew Gillum\nAgain this is this is unscientific but it's political professional ... political science always got sound like a college football pool yes Bolivia who buddy who college football might be a little bit more accurate like fifty six percent of insiders surveyed expect governor Rick Scott will beat Bill Nelson fifty six to forty four\nThey'd expect governor Rick Scott will beat Bill Nelson fifty sixty forty four but at the same crowd again Republicans Democrats and independents sixty three percent believe that Andrew Gillum will win the governor's race only thirty seven percent to San Francisco to well to\nDo it is the vote recount so if you're a disservice to the supporter don't be discouraged just get out and vote meant\nThat actually has nothing to do with what I've just read okay thank you but what I'm saying is is that it this is these are the the people that followed the game and the ... quote sports analysis and it is this ... Gillum away and what do you think\nI think what was going to win but again this is not a scientific poll so although there are scientific ripples out there they do say he's going to win I think it's probably a boat in buildings favorite be honest with you\nOne of the things they were supported by two billionaires who came in and helped her campaign and and largely or campaign early on was funded by them George Soros and Thomas dire [noise]\nHow do you square sort of a populist progressive campaign that once they get big money you know among other things it make money out of politics get dark money out of politics and yet it's billionaires that help prop up their campaign\nWell tell ya I Am out of the deeply appreciative of of miss a thorough says well as Mrs star both men whom I've known for some time\nAs we reported do you have ah we've had you on the Republican officials on this radio show was offering by the Democrats but anyway I guess the cheaper for them to\nDo it from way up in the hills to swipe at the ... [laughter] but uh that makes it a lot of out of town workers have come in and to a state of Florida helping out Gillum and of course that happens with the Republicans as well but they're pumped Tom's dire told the New York times he'll spend another two million dollars plus the get go elected heroin and that's the guy wants to impeach Trump by the\nWay it was a big surprise if he even won the nomination in in large part because of stars money during the primaries\nMember Gillum was the guy to brag hey I'm the only non millionaire non billionaire in this whole race by the way I'm at the these are going to be inching up the next couple of weeks if you wanted it Neal Gail them\nI mean they're going after the centers where do you agree with it or not the Gillum campaign seems it seems just wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security is going to cut Medicare those are issues\nUm and then you're talking about FBI would kill them right if he's got an issue of the ... there's not enough money that he wants to do you have to raise income taxes you'd have to bring an income tax and the state you think this would be a big issue for Gillum to be\nA talked against by the dissenters crowd\nYou know what they probably would but it's the guilt by association thing and I'm not sure that resonates a lot with people it may or may not uh but uh you know the issues that they are more important\nMore as we continue to move along triple to talk triple to eight to five five talk radio W.

party have on stage\nBy the n._r._a. the n._r._a. lobby that's out of that but the vast majority of its members support on more commonsense gun owners are for things like gun lock down face most gun owners for background check but I Want to ask me something Democrats\nAre for gun control\nMore for the mentally ill that Republicans\nAre doing more for the mentally ill\nEver have a conversation about gun control in a wake up and realize they have flat on its hands\nNo way no it couldn't the argument be that when it comes to the issue of mental illness it's the Democrats who never never never

or calling for justice in the wake of this tragedy leading to men dad groups including my dad's in the justice coalition to name a few they marched outside city hall asking that they will find a way find a way to make sure that this never happens again\nPolitical activists here at city hall from my voice their concerns about the only thing that environment and they now at that time local leaders

I think that's one of the primary concern because that's what the local media is in is it focuses on in the evening news right so I think that the perception a lot of towns as there's more crime than what they're really is but it's very important too I think on on on the local level how about you know Kevin ... you know the\nChief of staff former chief of staff or Gillum is running for mayor in Tallahassee and he says the crime has been one of the worst he's ever seen it needs to go down that doesn't make a the uh the track record of Andrew Gillum has demanded that credible does it\nWell look at these issues where how hackers primaries often complicated because some of the isn't really Tallahassee hospital eats\nOh half his crime rates and complicated 'cause some of it isn't really Tallahassee responsibility a large part of the crime rate which included deals with four to stay sane you\nAnd it comes on their statistics look I think crime is a problem Tallahassee I think it's frankly one that it just senses\nAnd or the Republicans should have focused on earlier instead of just yelling socialist\nAnd talking about an FBI investigation which frankly you cannot narrow down Brian Q A thirty second spot\nA also can be very candid with ... rather than us from this particular issue here you'd be spent last year and a half screaming at the FBI is about the size of the problem is now up oil it's politicized who does that Donald Trump but well let's see if we can deal with\nI think that is a problem I think they needed to get off of that and start feeding dealings record when it comes to sales tax in Tallahassee much property taxes we Tallahassee\nAnd yet when it comes to crime in Tallahassee instead of you know whining about socialism and talking about oh you know Andrew Gillum if he's elected to take away security a Jewish daycares across the state that doesn't war I I think they need to be a lot more strategic on their attacks against you know we have two and a half weeks ago maybe they'll change\nWe were talking about a lot of the listener say that they think it's going to be a game changer Ron Davis you know ride Roger and I were talking about this earlier in our in the six AM our people call up and say well we think the debates on TV is going to change everything but yet wait a second Roger I mean\nHow many hundreds of thousands I mean what a ...

Ron this state isn't it tore has to win or lose elections by sixty Seventy thousand votes I mean if he hasn't gotten disease out there but those have already voted out there what makes you think that a debate on TV is going to change things I think the debate is going to\nIf he does if it's handled correctly the debate's going to change the the issue as to the economics that's\nWhere this is going to change it they said please have already voted it could be too late for seven days and I understand that but those people that voted it made up their mind and weren't in nothing they're they're they're hearing either way is going to change they've either voted for the Democrat 'cause they were always going to vote for the Democratic voting for the Republican 'cause they're always going to vote for the Republican\nThese debates and it and and you know a month ago we were talking about this race in Gillum had a six and seven point lead there and we're now down to one one and a half points if I understand correctly people are starting to bounce it talking about the economics if the census can focus\nIn the general election uh one thing to look let's be very clear what this one's about this is not about CFOs you patrol and I don't even think about the attorney general's race I think it was about the agriculture commissioner race where I Do think with the except you know it's not as much attention\nBut that is probably the ... race which is the closest great now out of those we met ... wants to continue a Second Amendment the second amendment policies that Adam Putnam embrace such as happy for example local tax collectors having them be able to deal with concealed weapons permits\nAnd uh the free that Democrat and the train a lobbyist would basically be on the other side of the issues you would absolutely be saying look yeah cut back that would come down to\nYou know if you weren't thinking gun control v a major issue in the ocean to services commissioner race but it absolutely is and I think that what this one's about I really do\nOne that has potentially be a very very close race\nFrom the cook Political Report David Wasserman says a blue wave looked good but in Florida and may not be as strong as some people think it is or\nOr or Hispanic areas like the Central Valley of California south Texas even parts of South Florida how\nWe're not seeing the same types of numbers pop for Democrats so yes I still think Democrats are the clear favorite for the house majority but they're also dangerously close to getting their clocks cleaned in the Senate if some of these rural states start we're breaking heavily for Republicans\nRoger you know we were talking about this earlier in the morning show that folks out a way to hear this\nUm remember that President Trump Mitch McConnell says that the ... the adrenaline shot has probably been most likely coming from Brett Kavanaugh Dianne Feinstein this week in the Washington Post said\nThat if you look the Democrats and she's the minority leader on the on the Senate Judiciary committee they plan to quote investigate Kavanaugh again\nYou know they know how to get the Republican voter for sure for sure a lot of Democrats are going to be mad at five dive when there was a red\nWave Jonathan Turley law professor at George Washington university I\nSo sure you could have a trial for the dead if you want it or the confirmed but it is a direct full idea I think the framers created this process\nThey have some finality now the Democrats may not like the outcome of the vote but fifty over fifty ... senators are expected to be satisfied with this record\nAnd to confirmed this nominee if we're going to start to do do over as every time the majority changes then we will never have a stable court\nYou know what I find is interesting Ron if if if they think they're going to be able to wed I'm maybe on the house side on the Senate side I mean you're not pushing Obamacare that I go I mean tax cut they're throwing everything out there where in the world they think that this is bad enough the Republicans are\nIf they're throwing everything out there where the world if they think that this is bad enough the Republicans are doing well in the polls with cabin all what makes them think by going after that that they think they can knock it what get more of a democratic surge by wanting to impeach are investigating Kevin\n... it's just about you know it does it was just a popular theme one and a half two weeks ago it's it's we're getting back to the economics\nAgain and I think this is where you're starting to see the the Republicans narrowing these gaps in a lot of these and may maybe this blue Williams is is is is not going to turn into a reality I still think it's going to be really close but again I I think as we get the fortunate thing for I think for the Republicans in this election cycle is there are a lot\nOf very liberal Democrats running on tickets these are moderates a you know the ... when Obama took took office in two thousand eight\nThey weren't the Democrats were clever and they ran a ton\nOf democratic candidates who sounded Republican right at the beginning of this election cycle that's what it looked like for the primaries wiped out you now have very liberal Democrats running and I think is they're running against the the the the the Republicans with more enthusiasm now you're beginning to see these polls\nNarrow down because you cannot afford those policies\n... minutes after the hour tripled to talk ... triple to eight to five five you buy in to the polls right now\nThat ah according to one of the Florida inside of polls fifty six percent believe Rick Scott's going away and the same group that was also polled say sixty four
