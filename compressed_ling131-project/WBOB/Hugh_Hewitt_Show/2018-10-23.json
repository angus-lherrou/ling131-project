S.\nYou're gonna find him is he going to find Middle East you got to find everything why not allow them he\nSays we're not allowing them in the country Charles Lane from the Washington Post listen to this clip talks about how these people are being exploited south of the border and yet when you listen to what he says it's almost like they're being exploited when it comes to this country but by President Trump because there's an election\nI Believe they're being exploited all along the way I think they're being exploited by a human smuggler so I think for things for the ... the specials and Mexico are probably being exploited politically by the under an opposition there's a lot going on here that frankly we don't fully understand but I think\nThey're now going to be exploited politically or the president a sees us Curtis says a terrific issue for him\nThe one thing about it I think people should realize these seven thousand\nAt lower right so the president's exploiting this it looks a little bit further if you want to talk about the politics both sides and exploiting this big time\nDemocrats are all open for the open borders they voted campaign about abolishing ice they don't want to sit down and come to the table with President Trump so to sit back and say well this is all President Trump exploding and I'll listen I'm not going to disagree he's using it for a campaign and why not it is a campaign issue but he's not the only one using\nThis as your interspersed with all the pictures of the kids and the ladies that are marching on foot by the way over a thousand miles you got the terrorist organizations that ISIS people be MS Thirteen and a ... now you may be watching this on the news this is a category five hurricane headed straight toward them which guy yeah making that even more complicated\nAnd here's the latest Martha McCalla reports that the Washington Post in an article was embedded with this and the Washington Post says when they interviewed many of these individuals and they've been deported plenty of times from the U.S\nHas a report today than that Washington ... have you with us as many people that they talk to the Washington Post talked to two other important that they had already been deporting several times from the United states and they were going to try to make it back in again many of them to try to meet up with family members\nThey try to run in between the border guards at places that they now are poor that's all I mean I didn't think border and one of them was quoted as saying that's how they catch him and you try to get back what what kinda fits that\nAnd yet the same people that have been deported now are trying to come back are you shocked by that democratic strategist Dave brown says you know we need to get to all this can be taken care of the magic wand a bipartisan immigration reform he says with the Democrats had been leading a\nTeam but I disagree very much disagree with the fact that Democrats haven't been at the table and trying to work in good faith I mean look I served in the Senate and twenty Thirteen as an aid that year we pass comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform Democrats or Republicans came together and so there is there is a proven path\nThere is a way to find a a a path forward for bipartisan immigration reform and if\nIt's so that was\nOf a path forward for bipartisan immigration reform in ...\nSo that was brought up on a debate Thomas Homan who's the former ice director says hey I was I stricter for the last year and a half but I didn't work with these Democrats they didn't want to sit out President Trump\nAre starting to get to talking about the work on the hill and the Democrats are on the table well barely was on the hill last year and a half because I was very strict last year and a half and they weren't on the table\nWhere I met with a lot longer than we try to shut down the loopholes they refuse to shut down because when they talk about sanctuary cities and your first guest says in the ... when you have when he won't fix loopholes you aren't pricing\nYou aren't touching others make a dangerous journey and they're just not people entering the country illegally as use as a national security issue because while they're running damage from one set during the run and drugs and bad people through another sector more chose tied up\nAs I say over the last I\nDon't care who was on the other side of Florida we see Florida but it has a\nA former congressman or is it healthy and I said this about what's going to expand access to health care will get a job as a way to make me with all of our environment we got to make that if I was hearing it said if we play Florida the kind of thing that I\nCan I ask a question I get dissect this all day\nWith Jimmy ... and there is less than we had to use six where you know we still have people working two or three jobs okay we still have people where we need to make wages grow quicker I don't deny any of that\nCountry's ask a question where is the same topics used today that worked there for four five six years ago when President Obama\nWho's depressed that when you had to hire you six more people looking for work out there where you had more people now working in the days we saw that as the days of Jimmy Carter we're to talk about those that have not that don't have in the stock market you mark Martin did very well to data government intervention to quantitative easing by ... and other policies all I'm asking\nIs for consistency\nRight well you're not going to get consistency when there's political considerations that appealed to you\nKnow they're going to be asking a specially during an election season and uh you know obviously I'm trying to be at least be as objective as I came with a deal I'm not calling himself a socialist while at the same time the most progressive is there an argument that could be made but he is a social progressive we'll get an economic or at least moderates\nHere's the thing everybody wants to use the name calling ... folks the name calling ... too easy break it down by issues he is a progressive I think when you talk among millennials I think when you talk among young people in better I think they're going to stay a little bit more progressive been socialist they think socialist is all about Europe\nProgressive it had a much more of a of a popular term right that far more as as current populated sounds positively progress you know who would ever have set up what I'm saying is it I mean but remember in the Nineteen twenties the Nineteen thirties a liberal was a conservative out their\nClassic liberal was it pretty much what Bob misses is very much any kind of a free market type of a conservative out there even the Democrats back\nThen that pose a lot of FDR's government regulations in the Nineteen thirties or cult classic liberals all I'm saying is as far as the ... the connotation of the ... the term\nProgressive ... most people that we want to move forward progressive is something people can kind of relate to that so just throwing the word socialism out there and the latest numbers by the court and penny I pull out their show water massive lead\nFor ah the bill Nelson fifty two to forty six over governor Rick Scott\nDid sat down with the Tampa Bay times Adam Smith at Fox Thirteen Craig Patrick about where the current races are held today [noise]\nYou know it's very hard to whole mid term election I think Andrew Gillum and counting on on likely voters to turn out we do know that in mid term elections Democrats just don't turn out nearly as well as\nWell look you have written about winning by one percentage point four years ago when we first said four years before that oh I'm In a different story\nSo let me let me stop right there Rick Scott has got some good policies we all I think would admit that the the numbers out their share about sixty five percent that he's done a terrific job with hurricanes having said that he won in a huge Republican year two thousand to\nOne by a little bit maybe over one percent a two thousand fourteen now there are a huge year Oprah feeling governor Charlie Crist again by about one percent\nNow folks if this is a big year for the Democrats and this proclaimed to be this does not bode well for governor Rick Scott you're right but if you think he should win based on how well he's done a as the governor but yet he hasn't really been talked about threats\nAnd another huge factor the panhandle voters mostly Republican get to the polls in some cases will be able to vote and that's a major part of the Republican block the state of Florida\nTo the to clear healthcare place here\nThat seems to be consistently the number one issue in the hole and I think it's really the thing that that bill and talks about over and over and over again rather than just has not yet released a plan of any kind of he has been very much for the whole\nAnd where it's coming from is it the way that brings Nelson\nI think there's no question announcing that they bought a squeak us out he he can\nThink there's no question Nelson is able to squeak us out he he can kill him big time you know\nThis was the question we asked a couple of months back would you know Bill Nelson was run against when he was losing the polls against governor Rick Scott ... we keep asking the question do you think he'll run as an independent or as a moderate you know he'd be judged that and now you listen to these guys and they're saying hey Nelson will gets over you can make Andrew Gillum\nPreventing pregnant on the Democratic side behind the camera is all about and get along really got specially a African American\nUp big time liberal Democrats fired up in a way that we really have not seen a lot of oil\nBut here's some more with the latest numbers out their hair is Fox News at night Shannon ...\nOn the wall Street Journal that over the last couple of weeks there's been this closure and cleaned affects\nMany talk about how this gap and closed out they say this X. rated as the most competitive by the nonpartisan cook Political Report parties are dead even on the question of which one should control Congress last month for Democrats to lead that same question\nMy Thirteen percentage points among registered voters plant among likely voters me forget about the gap you want to see cause\nThat was ... at Britain Hume said hey you know in the latest polls come out the races normally tight and but he says what we're seeing and Roger this is kind of an interesting take about there's a certain Trump voter out there those say hey I don't like what each weights\nDon't like the comments he says but I Do like his policies\nTo theater or racist tighten as you get ... that's usually the pattern\nBut clearly there was a cabin Republican voters and perhaps to some extent on democratic ... Democrats voted her so motivated already but it's a little hard to believe that they got much extra out of that they're they're hyped up to vote\nBut it looks like to do ... ... voters right now as well I'm hearing a lot of you know that Trump has a hardcore supporters for whom you can do nothing wrong [noise]\nBut there's another category of voters and I run into them all the time when I'm away from Washington\nSays I I don't like this guy would what he's doing I hear that all the time from various different kinds of people in various different situations\nYou know who else they used to talk about that was a Bill Clinton really yeah\nI think that's a factor out there and and he may then therefore it may be showing up at his approval rating they certainly said that it may show up and support for congressional candidate running as Republicans ...\nSo you so here's the question we there are now less than two weeks left\nIf you had to look at it just surmise that this is my this is not endorsing as we do not endorsing his radio show we bring up the facts you guys don't like it some of you say oh you know fake news I won't have we just reported it is for you to decide on either side of new report\nBut the Guillain campaign seems to be more pumped up for you as soon as as a matter of didn't Sanders cap it I'm just telling you\nAbsolutely there's a lot of enthusiasm he inspires a lot of people and a lot of people who are left in fact I Know some some Republicans who say that they're going to actually support Gillum wonder why that\nIs it's about G.

I think\n... got a lot of enthusiasm on his side right now with whose constituents being open leap a supportive and you know campaigning with him\nI Want to be a fair to Ron do because there is a history but sometimes you spend time going into areas they're not going to go free anyway you're wasting time and resources are the areas where you could actually make a difference when you advertise for example on social media and TV however that doesn't stop in the liberal areas liberal counties it goes every\n... ... that's the case and why is the Gillum crowd campaigning in red communities that we're both we've heard from all of you out here they not on our door\nWe're not even a we're not going to vote and that way you were living in part of why are the questions as you got to this is the Democratic state Roger right you've got to get democratic votes in order to win otherwise or you suppress the vote and have them that they have a better turnout right [noise] yeah so ... so I don't hear this one did the same campaign it's\nPossible that the Gillum campaign does have more resources more volunteers we hear reports for the Republican Party but they were shipping and people from other states but at the time but you can deal maybe they've got more people available this particular campaign\nOn me that they voted for capital All right\nSo let me stop it and then he goes on further some of you may be spilling coffee or driving into ... here's you hear this I say that little bit of tongue in cheek\nHe has called himself the most progressive candidate in this race he called it the most progressive candidate far left in the Democratic primary he's been called the socialist wait till you hear what he says he says I'm not a socialist he says in fact I'm a capital\nIs one of the fastest growing as a nation\nOf people that you try to solve the socialist and all the other thing out of range you know I Am I'm a capital leading [noise] also believe in and I don't believe that they are [laughter] you\nKnow as I say what were the last I don't care who was on the other side of Florida we see Florida whether that's a form of Congress in the United states [laughter] if I were going to expand access to health care\nCase so what do you agree with him or not is his views more let's forget towards socialist for ... because they're Republicans support tax increases ... do you call them a socialist\nI mean the question is is Gillum policies more government or is it less government out there that is how we should be defined\nOkay\nThat is how we should be defied you can use the name calling all the way you want on both sides the question is this is it easy for higher taxes and specifically in one area or what do I have a positive effect or seem for more of the free market I think that's how it on the\nTerm you know what I I think a lot of people were to finally get by association the you know there's the whole guilt by association typically in politics people you happen to have met before you know or a certain way and they automatically assume these are people Gillum as openly working with people like Bernie Sanders he calls himself a socialist\nOthers on the far right yeah left he says he's the most progressive candidate running you know it's hard to kind of get away from that it\nI I I'm with you on that but but the the point is is you need a name on it instead of the name calling you need the mail and down on issues people want to I mean when you think of socialism you think of overseas she think of Venezuelans who you think of progressive Islam that's been a term it's been used a lot more here\nDepending on what do you agree with it or not I'm just saying as far as the term conservatives\nOkay every week party but conservatives there\nThat people can relate to disagree or not they can relate to the bird right or to the noun right there when penny act poll says that Florida Democrat Bill Nelson as open up a very wide lead\nOver ... Republican governor Rick Scott fifty to the forty six percent this was discussed with Tampa Bay times Adam Smith and Fox Thirteen Craig Patrick\nToo in the hole and I think it's really the only thing that that feeling talks about over and over and over again [noise] around the campus has not yet released a plan of any kind of he has been very much\nFor the whole and where is since we're coming from is it the Gillum wave that brings Nelson\nThink there's no question Nelson unable to squeak us out he he can kill them time\nTo think of it on the Democratic side behind the candidate is all about Gillum really got especially a African American\nOn which ones did you like Kirk of the amendments slow by going to ask her\nI I think that people should have the right as far as the gambling amendment and that that just makes all of a sense of the world [noise]\nUm I I I think the um the amendment for prisoners no hot unloaded new on that one um but you know the kind of give you an idea and I'm I'm conservative guy\nBut uh um some of those things on a chart or had in the wrong direction\nYou said so you don't believe after five years a felon she'll be able to relieve stress a clemency board and trying to get their voting rights restored\nNo I don't I think that you know it it's order things for you commit the crime and saying well if I get caught doing this and are not ever going to be in Oregon and one of the things that's current hit me and I think that's that's part of it\nBut you do know that amendment had met it'd be excluded people who've committed sexual or violent crimes that was only non violent crimes\nI don't care [laughter] somebody's back pocket could be very violent you know I'm Sorry I'm alright Kurt good to talk to you\nKnow there were other ... I'm looking at the amendment right now one more time in a minute for and this was the one again resorting to this would be um [noise] if it's passed\nAgain or if for it it's a different doesn't say anything about violent crime it just has to do sexual predators and murder okay I'll start not violent yes all okay you know\nLet's go to um no I had to rewrite ... I mean here's a question a triple to talk nines or before tripled to eight to five five if they want to sit back and say after five years we might allow your gun rights to come back\nWould you go along with that amendment a lot of people would not [laughter] kind of curious about that James good morning you're on WB obey morning hey\nYeah I I Love it if you guys actually did a show just covering all the event that um because there's so much double talk in coal loopholes inside of all the things that it really confusing even if you read it on paper\nUm there's a ... when it comes to a lot of the amendments that they have out there definitely what would the one you're just talking about her um we're storing Salinger writes that she has another grab at people being able to reach into the entitlement spending neither people that\nYou know they broke the law now they're probably going to have a hard time finding work there probably on some sort of social Dole at that point in time and now they're just trying to make it reach for Democrats spending at that just the way I view it\nIt's ... ... ... one plus one equals too when it comes down to things like that\nWhen it comes to a voter voting on uh casinos absolutely I think you should put more power in the hands of the people in less from the end of the government\nThat's a great point I think what do we do this on friday show okay why don't we do a ... man Roger my emails have blown up about constitutional amendments why don't we do this folks why don't we do um will do two hours\nHave a big debate to maybe I mean 'cause there's what how many minutes are there was a Fifteen fourteen Thirteen or hold I'm looking at right now uh yeah there's too many of them but somebody to so\nMany they couldn't even fit the ballot in the end the return novel yeah down there was like\nWhat Thirteen lucky Thirteen and a ... the ... county and some of the both sides have a pro and con and this issue as well what are we do this on friday show\nWhich go from like seven to nine lives do would love to have a lot of the audience out through the pros and cons and will break 'em down on both sides and care and how people do triple to talk triple to aid to fly by talk radio W.

I Love to hear from you what do you think a pro and con which one do you think should be added or put to the state constitution which one do you think just as like this is a complete joke a Dana hey Dana good morning you're how's it going\nOh it's going to predict God excited I got a I've ... I've I yesterday I voted I voted for restoring boating right yes even to power I Believe the only reason to take your vote away is trained him\nAgainst the state of Florida and the United states you somebody go to jail pays the price\nFine I don't care what the what the how terrible the decline seem to be all people all citizens must vote in this country and participate in our government would you like how I failed\nAnd get on it would you now there were those out there that wanted to exclude for example murderers and sex crimes would you exclude them where'd you lump them into your comment where you just said\n[noise] Ah yes I Do not exclude them as they are a citizen of quarter of the United states we need them to participate in our government if they\nPay the penalty yes I Do that ... is that we want to thank God yeah traits and treat them know\nHow how do you feel about restoring maybe Second Amendment rights to felons because they lose that as well if they're convicted of a felony yes do you think they ought to be able to get a gun that they come out of jail\nWhile yes okay I I don't I'm not comfortable with that but if if they're they're out of jail they pay the price yeah\nDana you are consistent that is what I like what are the people would agree or disagree Dana I Love consistency on his radio show\nWell let me tell you this to you might get interested in that\nI Am a Democrat for life right that because I'm what they call a Dixiecrat I'm from Baltimore, Maryland\nAnd uh I I can run for the state legislature and Marilyn that the first gay candidate for public office and I'm very political\nAnd use that you disagree with the Democratic party on\nAll the Democratic party I don't even believe that truly is a Democratic Party anymore I often you know they're like\nYou know you're part of the history of the Dixiecrats they you know we're so for segregation or do you share some of those\nI Would be you know what I grew up in that I'm I'm going on seven years old and I was much more comfortable and do face but Hines chain\nAll right well it's good to hear from you\nAll right All right yeah it was George Wallace before he passed away he you know the renounced his segregation views too so\nYeah he I think but he he wasn't gay but anyway so now but I appreciate that you know see what\nHe is you know he and I would probably agree in several issues than we would disagree but you know what he's consistent yeah that's all we ask\nFor those ... those are the right to be consistent something you'd never see from the media Dana bank you for the call triple you talk he says that everybody should get the rights packed everybody except for treason murders and sex offenders to get the rights back what do you think about that triple to talk triple to eight to five five talk radio WB it'll be [noise]\nThey just out he says that I understand where Republicans come across he says they're not building here's one from Jim on amendments for he says no because every convicted felon can submitted a request to governor for restoration of rights on a case by case basis and can be made public for all to see this is a liberal ploy to gain more votes you buy into that you know what\nI don't know if it's necessarily a fair because of that you you have partisanship playing a role in that um possibly saying whoever the governor ... maybe it maybe a Republican or maybe a democratic governor because\nI'm not saying whoever the governor ... may maybe it maybe a Republican or maybe a democratic governor because they are looking sometimes\nLeast to have the ... the potential to ... to consider the partisan political ramifications then I don't think that's necessarily the objective is it probably could be here's one from Tammy she says ah your\nCaller a that wants more democratic votes it's part of the punishment of a felony or those are committed a mentality losing your vote is not the prison time\nZones have a history of making poor life choices and people want them\nTo vet ... listen I got to be consistent yes selling ends do make poor choices do they need help yes there are those out there that have restored their lives I mean for ... the surf was involved in the murder would dictate while nevermind ... country in the service announcements victory but\nAnd he came out I mean I saw ... years ago he's a little creepy to be honest with you but you know he claimed to be a born again Christian I don't know a car let's say Tucker but does that mean that they shouldn't serve their time to be given the death penalty\nA lotta times below when people who have committed crimes that were useful offenders are maybe very young maybe under Eighteen Morgan Freeman for about ... made very very poor life choices at that age where they grew out of it they\nHere's here's the point to to do last individual sentiments email felons have any history making portal life choices and people want them to vote and listen I can tell you people that have not been arrested that make poor life choice not saloon but folks they have\nTo have the right to vote I mean they I mean are we going to discriminate people on income and they have the right to vote I mean if people maybe listen I knew people that can't really read or properly spell does that disqualify them from being able to vote\nTripled to Tom tripled to eight to five five Jay are good morning you're on WB it'd be what's up\nHey Mr dean let me tell you something Mr Gillum has hit the wrong with that capitalism thing or what\nI Know but you gotta love this okay alright alright very simple flick close looking slick talking tells you what you want to hear the only time that God of the capital is it one he opens his wallet and pay for something himself\nOkay there you go\nBut yeah I mean but I Am but here's the question is I mean this is fair weather weather you know at Rhonda Sanchez was a partner a business I I don't know but let me ask you this Jay art but I'm just asking um they had Andrew Gillum ever run a company\nNot saying that you just qualify him from come and gather I just want to ask\nThem if you ever run a company will the he know that capitalism\nThat really\nAren't good to talk to you know I'm thinking of new that here's one from William ad don't you think felons are more concern have other obstacles entering back into society rather than voting I agree with you I totally agree with you\nSo why let me just ask as I Know some people who emailed me ... at the ACLU supportive of this\nWhy would I Want to vote in favor well listen I I hate to him why don't hate to admit it I agree the ones with the ACLU\nWas back in the McCain Feingold when they want to limit the freedom of speech when you could put out advocacy ads in fact the Christian Coalition the American Conservative Union unions were altogether and agreement on that they didn't like limiting the freedom of speech and there's one time I agree with the ACLU\nBut yet you have to look in a case by case basis I I I understand the argument from some of my conservative friends oh this is this is just going to employ more people to vote or maybe it will maybe ... I don't know I'm a bit like minded I don't know if I Want to give them I think it should be done case by case basis and not just the way the magic why'd\nYou know let's go to Lou hey Lou good morning you're on WB it'll be\nHow you doing this morning I just wanted to learn a little insight not two thousand and one was convicted or court served about five years got out ... applied for a couple of jobs didn't have any luck and then I went to a delivery job and I told the ball straight up uh my past it was a drug crime\nAnd uh let me work for a week if you don't like it don't pay me shutting me home ...

Tucker ... Carlos ... Tucker ... I guess for children became a born again Christian\nAnd some people are advocating since he was a born again Christian she's doing good work in the prison maybe she should not see the death penalty a lot of conservatives said sorry you know what that is great she found Jesus but she's still they still have to be consistent\nAnd you know what you should get the death penalty I think it's each case by case basis the question is rich do we want to weigh the magic wand and just a lot to use an ex felon to get their voting rights back\n... well no but that's that's different is she didn't she didn't complete her sentence yet so some people to complete the sentence they do their time to get released legally that she'd catch different\nNo she was on the next you've got the death penalty that's when she completed her sentence\nYou're tired yeah okay so she was not and so that should be clear sense ... Bryant's she ... she didn't pay their pride yes but ... says we can't vote anyway she thought\nBut you're asking what that's what I'm trying to follow you\nWhat what what people that that people are paying the price and they're they're released because they didn't commit\nCapital a capital offense like killing somebody so so if\nThey're if they're if they committed another phone they made a mistake and and they're released because they did their punishment then maybe they should be considered to do a lot to be allowed to vote\nShould there be any exclusions I mean ... including to the ... minutes it's whether they were per se or murder or should everybody just get the voting rights back\nI mean there could be exclusions I think I think one of the student can be All right if they if they did it once and they did their time and they get released okay allowed to vote if they if they if they get convicted of another felony then they're done okay\nAll right so I mean again I like

wide open it's All right if you committed a crime fell he doesn't matter what it is you get your rights back after you serve your time\nSo you think it opens up a ... pretty much what you're saying\nAbsolutely absolutely because of what makes one crime worse than another it's just a lot\nThat's a great point you know ... you know Casey thank you for making that point I was asking the

actuality it's going to strip everybody of everything except ... they\nCan't you already do what you just said can they already do that\nWe do that now yes right or a yes vote on three would eliminate

said hey listen you guys do your thing you want to talk about a debate that we can do that\nBut we don't endorse a big issue like this on this radio show\nThe question that has to be asked if it's leaving to local control about whether or not Duvall\nJohnny or any other listening or he wants to put slot machines or whatever they already do that a few years back and ... and then the ... the to

example in the financial world if you have an FBI if you're a felon you can't get in the world of finance but what about to your point that kind of a very interesting point you made like for example cutting hair braiding or an occupational license so you're telling me according to a law you can't even apply or even to get that as an ex felon\nWill be denied it wow it will be denied the license and the kind of Florida is to maybe that should be changed as well\n[laughter] yeah thank [laughter] not only do the clinical commit crimes that they are denied their ability to earn a living to

jumping into this country illegally it's a it's not a ... it's a misdemeanor and you do it second time around it is a felony\nSo I just don't know people getting suspended unless they're bad bad bad and judges will come after you for that let's go to Cody Cody good morning on WB it'll be\nGood morning as I just wanted to comment on the gentleman who called earlier the same guy the last caller was from and you know he he mentioned something in his statement about how he had made a Beagle where he didn't have to go to jail\nTo accept the the a status of being a convicted felon where he didn't have to be incarcerated for it\nNow I understand especially with the public defender things like that get shoved through very quickly\nAnd I do feel for people like that but I haven't heard anyone and perhaps I missed it because I did tuned in late this morning I haven't heard anyone mentioned the clemency process that is that is available to them already you know governor Rick Scott since two thousand eleven as\nA reinstated the voting rights of over three thousand convicted travel right\nYou know I never hear that mentioned when they talk about this debate but um my opinion just to give you that and then I'll listen to you off the off line is you know anyone who will fully\nA skirt the law shouldn't have a hand in electing who writes the law or who enforces the law or to do to fix the law that's my opinion then I'll listen to your five\nThat as I you know when you talk about both sides that is very interesting\nPoint he just made you just you know why should people that want to break the law vote for people or encourage him you know to to create law that is a very interesting point I'm On this issue\nThe question I asked in and I appreciate it does it does it each case had to be done by case as you do know what he brought up is about clemency that not everybody is given clemency\nRight I mean you may have surgery time it over the last I mean according to the amendment here hold on let me just pull it up right here before we get back to the calls\nAccording to the amendment which is a member for about restoring voting rights that again a the ... there was an area where it's a clemency calls after five years there asked\nThe clemency board to restore the rights of the five years you may have been half\nDecent society would give you see right but we're not going to you know to ensure clemency there were people that you and I both know Roger that are decent workers but maybe they're not promote them all to a higher position I can use that word and\nSo I mean it's based on the clemency board so it it is based on case by case the question that some are saying is it does is create a magic wand forever to get the same rights back\nWhen they should be different you know for example the ACLU says well we're not gonna allow sexual per se or sexual crimes are murderers but then again what about people have been like burning made off and then of rich people off\nWhat about them you should be have your series seven licence restore that go to Barry Barry good morning you're on WB you'll be\nHere you keep saying are asking why uh Gillum saying he's

the rules it's a great question I don't make the law\nWe had a caller made a very good point when they're driving with a suspended license that means their car auto insurance is not an effect which means if they hit someone that was right no production protection unless they have all these are motors protection\nThat's great point we'll get to more calls big issue this morning to go to Craig and
