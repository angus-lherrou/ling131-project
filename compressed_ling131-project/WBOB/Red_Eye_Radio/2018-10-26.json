going to start where do you end up [noise] Jamieson volunteer fire company no money on the bottom of thousands of people like that really so we're sorry it's it's a lot of ways it's not an urban area [noise]\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor their true expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector\nNot that we don't support an increase in defense spending\nNo we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to all the economy's doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a ... a growth rate of of two point five six percent\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP\nThat's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector\nIt's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending over the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us on the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican a conservative\nOr liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe that an increased cost in goods in the marketplace benefits the economy\nThen you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does\nAll over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nWell and as we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then it's actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing where the gross is in the private sector or where the lack of growth is in the\n... in the in the ... that you do yes you you do have to separate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not why it's not why you do it but also that is\nThe majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause a multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something\nThat makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having economic growth thinking it's in our society thinking of smartphone\nYes you know like it so that that is that ... that great demand a because it's at that because it's\nCreates that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier ah the create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nDefense spending you will build the initial product mhm but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business\nMhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something you're using debt down the road where yes in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay\nOh it's where you get in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency and productivity about their business is down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business\nOn an entire economy yes man that I mean the difference\nYou could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general yeah and if you roll right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are do\nAnd that and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... and told the deal is signed her still on with the with with Canada the increase you you talk about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talked about what ... the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars both have been targeted by terrorists\nWe haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road for and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to\nEconomics and I have no idea where has has the ...
