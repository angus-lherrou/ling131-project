[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I guess I'm going to say we're not as big part of it got are now [laughter] [noise] well I mean do you think about it if if Republicans\nAre because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year there's going to skyrocket through the roof yes to over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war now it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred a ... million dollars at at a banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over\nBoth\nUh the Senate and the house and\nWhat would there never will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats won\n\nThat Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors and but at least a drunken sailor is ... how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking offended they throw out ice on anybody got it all relates doesn't it uh\nBut how much would Democrats ... Republicans are are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there's no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my the twenty ninth anniversary that this week uh doing talk radio or the first issue that we had which was back in eighty nine\nWas the whole clean sweep that Congress was spending too much money and it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protest all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point right but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [laughter] [noise] yeah like today somebody got them are marching into these what are you guys marching for the debt who's that national debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar again last year from the federal get them every working\nAmerican the the debts that basically as it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf but\nRemember in the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\nBecause working norm is Lee wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said a couple of years ago billion ... billion areas which was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle that has two hundred and ten thousand mile\nOh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out what the trash [laughter] that would be going my butler would I Would\nBut because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the taxing was the right thing to do is we evolve in state of before\nA irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems still spending a and and that's what it comes down to\n... because the the the fiscal policy uh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy\nBecome something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this\nWill start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on this program this federal program in yours your child's school\nNo up\nStart taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not well\nThere is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending and a number of issues that conservatives are watching and had been watching forever and are important because they've always been important\nBut this is it an Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but\nThe idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one couple in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for that's\nWhy even though you have when you have Jake Tapper of CNN and and even ...\nQuestioning occasional Cortez daddy and Gail I'm In Florida and and Gillum about the you know the ... of Medicare for all the way they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt how do you pay you can't pay for all your band and pay for what we're paying\nFor it today it's impossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt\nOn the uh on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much an interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know mid to late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens\nBut as we've said it's immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before we found the loophole\nOf taxation without representation we found a loophole\nYour tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent at all of this and we found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand let's put it\nOn them and because I said that I expect\nTo get the emails today which I always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in control in debt is all part of the\nBad ... ... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails\nWell because it effectively when he gets to the point that you can't even service the interest on the debt as a nation the massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust the U.S\nIt will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over nope no you can't\nBecause no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and would that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren will not experience\nOr what the
