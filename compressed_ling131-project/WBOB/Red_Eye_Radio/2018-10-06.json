testimony uh yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon a\nHas released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from\nPerkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee is private law firms just we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats did a ... D you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... the law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins too we\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and we got to the law firm they were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you could look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right\nAnd I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it\nAnd lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm that would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do they say\nWell as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys\nNo it was attorneys and attorneys made it so former general counsel\nJames Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm mhm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British\nSpy to compile the dusty a of an cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans\nThe house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the ... law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought the state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you can do a capitalist season though you could do probably more seasons and law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always ...\nSeasonal you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nOr changed because of change then to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's unverified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false\nAfter ... after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that it was to destroy the legitimacy of a legit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole ... everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at ... news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together and the last two years here's the\nProblem with having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working\nWhich means it's still relevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a no cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats did which Dianne Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes\nNow that we know how background checks for gun and they keep it ... they could have kept her name secret\nNow and we know the process yes they could have done it and she chose not to and\nFeinstein made this thing moving forward\nOr if if you look at this I mean this is where we got to had she'd done that in July we may not know Dr Ford's name because if it was part of the three oh two and was not backed up by anything\nThat information wouldn't have been made public it wouldn't have been made public anyway the vote just would have happened and it would have been either yay or nay on Capitol eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWhat book read are ready to do with a record ...
