I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays a Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would not be a bit disturbed\nThere's there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I and I to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I I like my life ... I don't want to change it mhm I and\nI don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a a friend who uh a friend or family member who ah ... at one time was working for a a multibillion it um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day\nMhm and\nMy family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are [noise] um but but\nThe point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to know\nI couldn't have lost anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people about what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation mhm you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nWell my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job for getting out what to do even if they're not going to give it away that's what I made it still going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life fight that right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going you write a play out of it let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life\nYeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life that I Do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was just one dumped optical ...\nMind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I I Am\nTalking about is is that about one more point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've got we've ever done really I mean it's ...
