we're talking about the political divide in this country but we've had some great color so far we really appreciate it thanks to all people of other stories you want to make sure recover them back to your calls\nAnd comments on the political divide in America I just I traveled over this one on um MSNBC and on Saturday joy read and the panel were in a discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the\nVery tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of Georgia than\nThey are trying to make a big deal he's from voter suppression voter suppression they're talking about the fact that\nUh there's you know there's a law in Georgia that you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong it said after every two elections it's not it after seven years and by the way a lot of people have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like\nSeven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong it's after seven years you have to purchase it and they're like and voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote so so Democrats passed the law it's like yeah but he wants to do it [laughter]\nWe passed it we didn't really mean that he means it they\nWere Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah but he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so that's bad he's suppressing the vote I mean this is all by the way if you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is when you think about it how bizarre that is\n\nYeah um it's huh it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money than we love it at that too is raising a ton of money so and and then oh Casio Cortez\nShe did it was very little money\nSo they're not ... they're one more example of them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and well we need to change that well that works against us\n\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to this a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North north Texas voter fraud ring\nFor women who are accused of targeting elderly voters were indicted on thirty felony counts of voter fraud and arrested following an investigation by the Texas attorney general\nBefore women who are accused of targeting elderly voters in twenty sixteen were indicted on\nThirty felony counts of voter fraud the defendants were members\nOf an organized voter fraud rang and were paid to target elderly voters in certain ... uh northern Fort Worth precincts in a scheme to generate a large number of mail ballots than a harvest those ballots for specific candidates the officers news released said\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in in the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nThat but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh uh yeah I agree with you you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know\n... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house that hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer twenty sixteen\nYeah but without stage but now he's beautiful dead yes right well because now is useful\nBut if you decided to challenge the president to manage it in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better find was that it actually deal to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him and Houston\nI'm not I mean I I think he would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many both for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm yeah\nKnow there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with for her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and then and those that\nDepartment under her leadership so you look at that and that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what word comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott ... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to

and\n\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that and that's what I Try to some of the ... you're you're you're pointing the finger at a a\nRepublican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one out loud here it's a fake as you really think because\nWhen when you talk to folks\nAbout the homosexual ... and the marriage thing or whatever that you're talking to the mission by issue is lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed and ... of racism racism racism racism you know at clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're a a man you can be a woman and\nThe the country in law's must\nAh recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black legally and I started thinking about that and wonder\nHow many cars we said that we said with the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial I said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and\nI thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay maybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what does the fight for a ... foot at all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender as there's also a trans racial is them and they want you to believe well if that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a\nYou know the the the civil rights act the protected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups then the civil rights era is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era\nThat happened there all that entire battle it's we're not\nAnd not only that you know the um the civil war was for a new fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems there are no why did we fight you know just to say it looks like that which should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no\nWe are Americans this was America we're not saying that we're as individuals better than anybody or any other country for say our ideas are better than everybody else yes or any other country\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas say in in in the constitution where\nThey they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you do you want to acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism and slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to a town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics\nOr changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats\nUsed to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't\nWhite man over the black it all over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I find incredible the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\nWill do I what I talk to black about\nThat situation I'm fully understand\nThat a\nCause I don't remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and a ship it or to black males as so every black male that within the city and okay look under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away right now so\nI'm like no you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system we fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against cultural for which\nJames uh thank you so much ... than the yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me and the conservative and live my life\nWell you know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor I spend my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the street corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative but I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs\nYou know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is\nAnd so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in the yard\nI you know I I think the of a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm and the responses that you got in the media coverage of it\nAnd James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there is a monumental change in in a black is going to vote Republican but they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left\nCannot permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid democratic base that they have held for a long time a long time we have a long long time eight six six Ninety read
