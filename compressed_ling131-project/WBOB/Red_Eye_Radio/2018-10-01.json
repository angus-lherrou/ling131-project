encouraged a great show first time caller here a brief but I have a real problem with uh [noise] it ... the Democrats is as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much praise\nAnd to me it was it was there was no competition to me she said she was just totally full orbit or on education [noise] um she didn't come off as being too broad a for one thing [noise]\nI myself when this was a fairly you know I'll be briefing you and you guys talk or you talk about it but I'm sick and she wants to shut off from the get go I mean and even a cab at all was just happened to be the one\nI think she was on the on the road getting ready to run with that which would you nominate [noise]\nOh God um [noise] it's just that she knows too much ... when she used to she believed a hundred per se but it was traveling All right in there I mean\nWell I well I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love to do in a never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible how\nForget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names that backs her story but the fact is what she says herself\nIf you just came and you'd say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself was not credible\nMhm yeah I mean that's that's what a centrally was at play here\nWhether or not she was to be bullied because remember what they were calling for first she needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be hurt well then she was heard well that's not enough weight about well if you believe her testimony to be credible\nThen that is enough her speaking in front of the American people we don't get to see the FBI questioning her on TV [noise] that's not going to be before the public\nSo tell me wasn't why wasn't fair about this process [noise]\nAnd that's what the left wants you to believe it's not a fair process actually a very fair [noise]\nRight now she got there how shadow that\nCode of ... all also tell she had last away\nWho cannot afford the yeah you you would ask you about you and we'll have to weigh in Las Vegas lawyer\nWould act like you would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as ... as I said very easily that's why she's not ... that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless\nThere were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement it's just a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave\nIts not credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody has to Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos lesser question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want it look as something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right\nBecause it's important that there is an expectation yep\nHuh remember who ... who who was it who has to Obama the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in ... Wisconsin\nOh no yeah yeah yeah well there's a lot of separate ... okay or one where you have a local reporter here ah from WFAN a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of ...\nThat that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right\nThat there's actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre world we're back\nBut a journalist is supposed to give a politician who won't answer\nA question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be gutless go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but it is well you're yelling at all of them in any you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up all you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions\nNo no I don't and what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question some well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just state it we're going to help this person build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative yeah well forget journalism right oh\nI'm Sorry then my question is the one I should be asking\nAll\nMy focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay\nAnd and the easy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou get\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did\nLakes is you\nCan respond to that state but if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter] but\nThis is why people right ... ... at least to frustrate the daylights out of him ... this is why people hate\nIt no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on they knew they were going to face tough questions or remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah\nYou come in with look when you're a senator and you can\nYeah when you come in with look when you're a senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when you go on a show you know while you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my step around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that which is a CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no it's faced the other way [laughter]\nMeet the press that west pressed the meat but we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to be we're just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm we there\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] [laughter] your mom [laughter]\nI might\nAs well be covering that answer every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that your mom\n[laughter] [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\n... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it\nWhy not just make it I I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of grade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words ... you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word\nAnd you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as usual there's a lot more [laughter] okay so that's what I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is the exact nobody's taking a the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of a Jeff Flake he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it\nI don't know I don't know who leaked it yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an [laughter] ah\nBecause various or not or a very observant yeah yes and it's not Democrats you might think Mr Coons and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero\nI'll say what I said earlier friday is a long ways away Trump just got
