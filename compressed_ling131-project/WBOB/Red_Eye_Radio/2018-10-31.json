Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys all discussion but uh\nBut well I don't understand why some people are saying or applying the birthright executive\nOrder proposed by Trump or the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law by our my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author\nAnd you got guys talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people from a foreign nation giving birth and our nation while\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got a SCOTUS it would be the job of ... to interpret\nThat would be the job of is more you will be his job of his lawyers to defend it but the executive order in a self\nOr is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nIt would be on the actual court case so the executive branch's interpretation of it is not the the final say now now and I have a very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge [laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge then it would it would stand and it would be the law the ...\nWell yeah 'cause that was the question going on yesterday which I thought was a stupid question gotten a president right an executive order to change the law and and what it hold on to well yeah sure he could write an executive order for a ham sandwich and I have no nobody challenges yeah then yeah\nBut it's going to say there'll be an injunction and there'll be an injunction and the law will never which I\nFind my way to go be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department maybe some input her idea and she's here to say that\nYou know let's attempt to get this and at at least\nFor the president I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put a just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and they were with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will but but\nStill though when people say well he's just the she's just campaigning\nAn\nHour and ... why not doing it is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's medic see that's my mind up that was where I don't want to exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset saying he just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fry just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you shouldn't complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you got many Democrats\nTrying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons is he got elected was\nIllegal or immigration and immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if\nHe financed the caravan which I don't believe he did but I don't think so and therefore when this was happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight it help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always run on and it'd be consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans\n... right exactly that's a campaign that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged and the ... he knows that\nSo he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yes politically\nWell that's okay because it is not something based on nothing if it's not starting based on imagery it's like when the Democrats\nHave complained before the Republicans are only doing this vote here a as a campaign thing to get us all on record so we made abstain and remember that a couple of years ago right sorry ma'am staying and just not show up and may not vote at All right well of\nCourse it's all about campaigning it's all about winning on the issue is all about [noise] uh you know sometimes you have to be forced to tell the people where you stand right how dare you now have you with us and\nTell us the personnel the people where we stand at that simply campaigning [noise] did you just enter the system that I live under\n[laughter] I don't know which is the name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Jim we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claim that those one hundred and sixty three million patch eBay detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the ways that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy and animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is a value added for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including the goal production\nThe problem isn't just United States now or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we own more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership all compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit once or the or that jazz okay so yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one hey I never search for a cat I rescued one it rescued you let's be clear right by the way you're not the only person that's so that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and the mango\nIs a black cat just ... Halloween ... Halloween and you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector ... thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it beeps after about ... you know yeah the toll is part of my house\nOf course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that let her out and really test its capabilities for it so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where it got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days\nSo do I take down a ladder not leave the ladder they've it or leave it white tickets out yeah the letters there for a couple of days and I noticed that the cat black cats keeps walking under the ladder felt that has\nGood luck on that side of my my ... should I be worried about yeah that's good luck thoughts I never had before uh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced she's impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts concede that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous\nYeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nI mean so uh uh there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a good point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian\nI'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today I might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember and this goes back ten years ago I think you and I were the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than\nTwenty five thousand people ... and ... how ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we don't want to go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with them I don't know like we have to [laughter]\nWhat do you do with and who decides who goes and and I think it was one of the of the probably\nIt's what and who decides who goes and and I think it\nWas one of the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you do with the way the [laughter]\nOkay what's your plan is going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first right\nHey that'd be a cool ... movie right\nIt's the end of the planet\nWe're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know the chunks of\nIce just start falling out of this guy or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then it freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie or\nIt would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] let's not make it about climate change that some about whatever right but if we could whittle it down to\nOne billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series over the period of years you know 'cause you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to kind of pick her up to deplete the population\n[laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek ... remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other I and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed more then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't they stop member that one yeah\nI don't know they were they open the window and they're like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how they ever solve that problem\nYeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nUh haven't said was about essentially a the there was the women could not give birth there was whatever happened to the apocalypse they no longer had the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically as lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats or talking these these far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd did in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ... thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right I mean it's it's not that it would be one of those those questions\nAlmost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh Well Bruce Willis uh you know look yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ... not no no that oh yeah no I wasn't Bruce Willis in deep impact your thinking how deep\nAnd ... are they going to say you're you're ... you're thinking of Aerosmith daughter yeah yeah the movie with Aerosmith starter um and and Bruce ... [laughter]\nIf I have one of our listeners just loves whenever you say yeah the movie with Aerosmith daughter [laughter] and now we're talking about the woman was brought up with wrote er yeah proto on them or motorcycle and and what's your name the one that was married to\nThe a sex addict Oh yes she's getting the X. files right right right right uh she uh she clearly a was not going to survive because she was part of the uh ever important media at MSNBC that had millions of viewers yes millions of viewers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "31"}
