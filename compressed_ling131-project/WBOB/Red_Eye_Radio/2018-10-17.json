about a ... at the times that we live in and I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to um argue with you or disagree with you\nBut I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so and ... and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you they know the the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide and how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson oh I'm I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there\nNow again means with comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want to learn [laughter] said a mountain [laughter] Ryan my ...\nAnd you know I mean

that this is supposed to\nBe a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view in a way to perceive them and then look at things it it means that\nYou can't pull out of their own people and that's not what America's about [noise]\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me said the Anderson Cooper no because I thought of a Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give them publicity but that's the guy\nAnd he loves it it's about and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer he doesn't have it\nBecause it's told me to [laughter] wrong but then there's so many of them he's actors right right they they want to take on the

nobody anything this ... problem was only I think going to be solved\nBy make people accountable leader and FBI when he gets the eye and when you get justice system but we can\nMake ... third world

that's like the way they like something\nThat kids need to be sent to being sent to terrorists you know uh to to to do their thing in college and give it to Cuba send them to Cuba or to Venezuela and see how that works out for them that socialist life\nYeah but they they don't know that right no you're good but they use\nAnd now that that's why ... capital and I'd go down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nWhy why ... capital down there and play football and see how that works out for him\nYou know I get oil his educated\nYou know what I mentioned Bruce ... last night one of the things he said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional over and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can indoctrinate the kids get them early enough they'd have future generations of voters but you're absolutely right\nThey except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear well how they can just\nRide to the office of president and it's just and then it's a pure communist and what's your name Hillary Clinton as solid landscape personified as so what's the rock Obama why do we want these people to turn this country into what one is a way is\nRight why\nBecause you're asking me if I'm On their side say that\nWell people don't understand they don't how evil communism\nIs was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore that when they have in our area capital planning on let me just finish fought wait hold on hold on one second I caught him you know it's okay by quota Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't win capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found it yet\nSo even there is some of the people who are proud of donated yeah that's what he said\nA year but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people think today that socialism is wonderful they have no clue because\nThey've been taught part ...\nI mean it's I I'm sure you've taught civics in school today are taught how to govern network gets me branches and they had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they all do man in the state I don't even ask people have questions and\nThey
