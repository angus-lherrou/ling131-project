currently I'm Jerry ... eight six six Ninety\nOr ... one of the things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from Aleppo legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's ... right [noise]\nUh it it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're lost for anything else to say that's that's what you say\nThe only other thing as I've said I've been a letter with yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice\nAnd I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's\nThe liberals who wish to put on judges who will pass legislation\nVersus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation\nIts original list construction is also been they've been called but originally ... who want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of big conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not to change it changing the constitution is up to a are changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process ...\nAnd it's that simple and we need to as conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that\nThat it is we the people through our elected representatives that need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators and we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nAnd the conservative judges like no no they're actually not a conservative judge that's not what we're looking for we're not fighting the same fight just\nThe part is an opposite of the liberal they wish for their justice is to make liberal law we do not wish our judges to make conservative law that does not exist we want them to uphold the constitution uphold the law\nAnd interpret it and leave it up to the legislature to make the law and we are not explaining that good enough every day [noise]\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking\nWhat are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys just what they've always used to even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care\nYeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to certain groups or or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case\nTo the vast majority of America let me go get a burger is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nTo they actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you watch what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer\nA former governor of of ah Louisiana\nTwo thousand two thousand sixty\nDemocrats try some self restraint\nNow I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] without restraint [laughter]\nAh it's not certain the Democrats I'm just wondering the parts of it because I actually started laughing during a it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm uh I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabin up\nIn the swap with Clinton there are positions Democrats Mao lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on his public duty is this is more\nA than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to enact the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead to search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they will win over ... Christians are rather committed supporters\nBut a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base Democrats can support gay marriage without foreseen small business owners to violate the richest religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions\nFight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles expand access to health care without eliminating private insurance protect minority rights without condemning law enforcement\nPromote immigration while protecting the borders value multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now it'd be lost in me already on\nThe ... I mean yeah okay [noise] and that's not going to happen yeah I lost\nYou were in a while right after we started laughing and they're ... [laughter] with all due respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not going to happen no it's not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nWell it it can happen and you look we as we said this after twenty sixteen we said this one Democrat because I find this fascinating I I find the ... election that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of Washington and here we we we need to we need to go into the heartland and she how people are really\nWe we we need to we need to go into the heartland and she how people are really thinking there and they really said that's twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluate it when they went to the complete opposite direction\nPlayed opposite yeah they'd gone more insane now they've gone more authoritarian they've gone more a dare I say using the F. word or with the fascists mindset out their wild claiming that they are the anti fascist that's the most interesting point them\nYeah I'm ... and it's that's not going that's not going to change a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of mind it out what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far left liberals\nThose that are really I mean then they're leading the party now I mean I think after the uh capital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now um but nonetheless what would bring them back\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most insane part of um I mean we can\nWe can giggle it at a governor Jindal's you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford a script and his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stuck and they can't get out of it it it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims because which fans just not the cause of it like this is this is what that is a great read for once you leave the Trump is the cause of it Trump stop the cause of it he's the effect of it\nAnd and so tell me if you think that would change just to save for the sake of the argument know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately and Mike Pence became president\nWe would have a beautiful whom by our world that's where I'd everywhere would go back where being normal we couldn't by Michael Moore onto the show and we would have a love fest right\nUm well case it\nYes right right he's sitting in your lap not mine [laughter] um [laughter] and\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but God was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know what I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs\nSo and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the [laughter] I don't I really really do\nWell our churches are ... well enough that simply it they they don't have they they can't handle the stress okay you're not enjoying that does what you meant to go with that yeah yeah that's actually what our men are actually true\nIt was an engineering so [laughter] that's that's what it was so here's the question if chase it\nBecame president tomorrow do think it would change no it would not know\nIf John McCain were still alive and ran for president and one would have changed you know what they call John McCain would change yes he'd go back to being Hitler yes\nEight six six Ninety red eye\n[noise] what books we read a review with a record ...\nJoined the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three nights when I radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nDrivers what is a major upgrade looked like a lot like one hundred brand new ... two hundred and fifty five ... trailer that's the result of pollen investing millions of dollars in its drivers about upgrading your career and driving for\nThe company that invests in you fall and even offers drivers higher starting pay rates with one hundred percent companies have health care premiums\nLearn more or why now it's ... dot hall and regional dot com for a call our hiring hotline for for six one", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "09"}
