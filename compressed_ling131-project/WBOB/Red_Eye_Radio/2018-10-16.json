World War two about it but I'm Around\nThe world they don't want a C.\nD. part you ... you had a chance to express your point of view are you left that World War one you're left a World War two and left out the Korean War you know you won may disagree about particular wars but I don't think it makes you a warmonger just because you understand that sometimes you have to defend freedom and liberty\nThat that is the case and you barely acknowledged relax I think World War two isn't necessary so you're entitled to a point of view I just want to clarify the differences there let's go to a ... jak in Aurora, Colorado you're on with mark\n[laughter] so but thank you so much to all the time the search new new to keep all the call waiting thanks for taking my call [noise] how's your\nMeat and corn and may be at least ... states flip to cope with that was about to fall and I couldn't help but Sam ... retired also as old\nAs doors walks to visit one of the people come in at home\n... who they are\nA lot of Sunni some happening pretty to stay safe\n[noise] um I'm calling because to me the greatness the member self those markets beginning people were focused on business movie those two new to this is a\nKing midway through the country a bipartisan seems things that people as wanting goods and services to purchase\nIt from the coast to coast\nTo ... most people get married up there and the country itself on the solution was not built my pocket change was built by businessmen\nWho got skin in the game by their own spots in the ... to buy the materials they needed the lawn care manual that produce things that are you\nBe able to produce things that are needed the colds I came to this great nation\nA lot of problems with the connection there so I Do apologize to you a bill in our teacher ... a New Mexico you're on with mark\nMark thanks for taking my call and boy he had some great calls you've anal each ... each and every one of them well I'd like to specifically talk or Rob a well spoken but misinformed\nAnd I want to call him a snowflake is the you know\nMaybe not maybe just fully misinformed guy from Idaho [noise] uh I I wanted to explain to him how we got to where we're at what this image of racial problem or you may recall that in the middle of his second term George W. Bush called for\nA some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up somewhat messed that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties we essentially hadn't had any ah any immigration reform to speak out\nFrom that time and the Congress and drag their feet and ... on on this thing until actually after ... Obama at our mental elected hadn't been inaugurated in two thousand and eight\nAt the last minute in December\nOr the lame duck Congress passed an immigration reform act and as it went through committee and in the weeks prior they just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages Iran the entire [noise]\nAnd I read all the documentation that goes with dieting Feinstein it slipped into their section too overweight somewhere maybe three quarters of the way and the bill of the problem is it that we have now they created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is they just they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live in uh the the town where we trained most of the border\nPatrol people okay the federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great after all this stuff in in the past prior to that two thousand they built almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim\nOf asylum or anything like that the border patrol agent on the ground and his supervisor and in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination whether or not that person got to state it was never\nPrior to two thousand and issue Jeter case in from the federal courts or any or to become involved with so George Bush side of this thing or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember George W. Bush was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation\nBut he felt that it was better than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals are ... are so many up this country tomorrow ...\nSo that me sad uh the regulatory environment that came out of that the all of that bill created all this stuff that we've had since two thousand and eight so for ten years we've been dealing with this and I the only way it's probably going to get solved this for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything is for education that at some point they're going to take the spirit of the law rather than our own individual feelings into a\nInto a factor in stark past the roles that regardless we may be able to do that now that we have some good memories songs for you to court but I'm not even sure about that it may take another piece of legislation to solve this problem mark\n[noise] well I Hope so Rob we'll call back I I Am Rob I don't know if we're ... Rob maybe during the week so I did invite him and bill\nThanks so much for clarifying that for us or in your hope as you said at the end you're not so sure when it comes to the courts and they're not supposed to be involved in and making laws and the first place and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye Marcus filling in on a red eye radio", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "16"}
