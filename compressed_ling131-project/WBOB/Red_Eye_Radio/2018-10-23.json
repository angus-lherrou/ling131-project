age okay those funds would sit in a low risk account managed by the treasury with roughly three percent annual returns\nWhat those funds would be and I don't know you and I already asked the question okay with that simply be borrowing money from future generations\nAnd the low risk ... would be putting the money that you borrowed back in to pay all of the dead\nWhich would do nothing because

hearing ... eight six six Ninety Rhode Island for the David in Oregon David welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nYeah Hi [noise] you know I always listen to show a you were talking about Booker Harrison Booker mhm yeah well they're they're trying to buy votes that's what it amounts to more yeah by giving away ... giving away the whole everything mhm\nThey can buy their ... well if they got married it could be president and first lady\nYou know I ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying the votes\nYeah you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela if you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just uh the remnants of a socialist nation but\nIn Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying ... I I think it is I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides that looks at people's self interest now the way it all depends what your self interested that's why I voted myself into his right eye I vote for my self interest but much might [laughter]\nWhat's worse my it it really didn't work out for me this last little Asian man we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan no but what is my what is my bigger self interest\nMy mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff no my self interest is freedom\nWell when we have the liberty of it did and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest and floods so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff ...\nThat's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe in don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt\nEither side now doesn't care about it it's completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo\n... for both sides now keeping the status quo\nOf what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we get from the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bail out how many people called up and said there shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money while from somebody else\nAnd that's where this shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservator voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to an ad remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world\nYou know because the world was coming through that\nUh but the that that a a fear\nDrove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know that's going to happen then right I Want mine's would became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me not voting rights to throw it to me and we were saying no grow with you know one\nRight way and and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands this when you take it out of the partisan talk and you talk about should we be run by a monopoly right should our health care system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got responds whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on health care no they don't\nKnow not for the same services they don't know\nWe can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures that's health care and ... exact timely healthcare so if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago\nWhen he desperately called because they didn't have the technology in Canada and take care of his brain tumor\nRight he would have died the other side what they're going to pay for right and you don't get to say so in the government makes the rules not only the payment but they make the rules yeah well\nAnd when you want to intellectual honesty you go to a well what's his name the former\nLabor secretary Robert writing who said look if we were being honest as liberals we'd have to tell you in order to have a health care program networks young people have to pay more than ... people die [noise]\nOr does that interest me if if I'm really think about a generation who was having fewer kids\nDoes the book or plan even resonate with them we were kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not oh wait a minute but\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need you guys and dollars a year exact and help with raising my child now that's because\nThe idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college or home and all this all these items well no no no no no no you're you're not\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes\nRight now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family because I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised she made six thousand dollars if she gets ... and how has it out with my kid exact I Want a six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe come out with Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare all too right yeah\nSo the what you didn't get mean now or ... or it and put my kid you're fearful thousand I Know I'm not having kids fifty thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the way it will give me both will know give me the sticks to him and don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right now I Want it now and gave me now gimme\nGimme gimme gimme gimme that day and you're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult boats they don't care about the future\nThey care about now see they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on route I Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nGreat show as banks will say that was thinking about out when you take the cash that bombed out so\nThat the tax will be so high that you'll end up getting only twenty five percent of that\nNow and we'll be right but I Would say yes [laughter] there you go\nThere were just like we were initially when we when we when we started with the program we weren't going to tax it but it hadn't years into it we realized that everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right and therefore nobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old now only be upset\nEight years later when we actually tax that money at yes exactly yeah\nYeah thank you uh well we appreciate the call it but but again you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want a the vote from so it's got to be free college for them it's got to be a free money for you you know a Medicare for all all of it for them to you and it has to be now\nYou know you can't waste any time\nI remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking it but when they signed it rather they signed it into law and of course the rollout didn't happen ... right away but you had people calling and making appointments [laughter] I Know [laughter] where's your insurance will I have Obamacare ...\nNo no no that's still a few years away at all what do you mean I Want it now there's doesn't do me any good of the other the other thing you know about Harris winds and ... and\nShe wins on the whole Medicare for all she wins on the whole uh the now you get to eat in company guaranteed income and everything for you for everything and money or you just stay at home that's all we need you to do just stayed home\nAnd uh you know pursuing your dreams of staying at home apparently your dream is to stay at home what dream would you have you can quit your job when Nancy said that you know we don't want people to to worry you know we just want them to be able to go you know quit their job and go pursue their dream well apparently their\nTheir dream is to quit their job [laughter] they're they've already pursue their dream I have a day and get home\nI have a feeling surfer dude is going to vote Democrat in twenty twenty ... what ... food stamps or right eye and guaranteed income\nThat he no medical care though he doesn't care about the college ... college child [laughter]\nIf people don't remember surfer dude was the guy that had come out and was collecting the the the food stamps and California and he was doing nothing hanging out at the beach and playing with his band remember we listen to his band it wasn't bad\nIt was like hey you know I'm\nKnow what he's doing today he has to be because we checked and he couldn't find them anymore but friends and and he went on to Fox News and ...\nSo we checked and he couldn't find them anymore but read and and he went on to Fox News and that was Sean offered him what an eighty\nThousand dollar you your job driving a driving a truck in the I think in the oil field industry unemployment auto out and he turned it down and it turned out it by the way those I mean those jobs are out there right now if you you know if you're willing to if you got at least a little which experience or you would you might need more experienced behind the wheel of a truck I'm thinking even\nA you know a for a younger guy\nBut here's the thing you get Kamala Harris she promises this then what happens inevitably right she gets ... let's say she got elected based on those master promises\nWell two years in her first midterm all of a sudden there's that shift in power let's say the Democrats won the house in the Senate and twenty twenty as well well they didn't get it they don't get it done in the first two years\nAnd there's a shift in power wall she doesn't get it done what she does get it done and the first two years well then there's the rollout it's not going to happen right away now you've made people angry and here's\nThe [laughter] the policy I think\nYou're going to have an angry mob these socialism doesn't work it doesn't give me my ... well no because she's too much of a conservative she's wanting to\nWait and see and here's a here's the other problem you're promising pre college okay free but I don't really want to go to class I don't
