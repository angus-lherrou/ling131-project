according to an executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report the request was torn investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation so there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of\nThe allegations we've heard from a the ... lawyer said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against capping off\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in the eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy got debt and Christopher Garrett the FBI investigators also spoke with a another attorney for one of the witnesses mark judge a close friend of Kavanaugh's\nOr was allegedly in the

know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and\nNo cooperation to get the right and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all along delayed delayed delight with the

stronger a the foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed there's nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can
