October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has Holly up by one in that ... a dead\nHeat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad is what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Holly and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation and an ad that clearly is a desperation at\nYeah they were just why not that he drinks and why he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours you're probably a salaried workers were just as your as your state salaried employee yes uh yeah uh but\n[laughter] but I Am thinking that that that's it but uh do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after falling the bottom of the hour yeah gets about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and this is her campaign at ... or the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group that says her commercial\nAnd they say well you know she's not like those crazy Democrat right so for a Democrat to actually put that in a senator and put that in an ad is just unbelievable and we'll have that coming up\nA problem in the bottom of the hour plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in lines open eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry particularly on history and and and that is the case in in food farm states it\nEven if you're not a farmer um you know what to do whatever they live near a fire yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\nA I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know or you know with my ... my party in it ... approach I write it again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in the the she doesn't she it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw air just what it is yes\nGot to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah big idea what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're there they're looking at Holly because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not\nA ... a lizard with war and or just you know a pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions\nGo outside of their state\nIn terms of the race right they will\nUh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have so\nThat the effect is that combat one Harris or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because\nAnything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point Kamala Harris or you know as a side with as you're crazy Democrats she as she just did as having a job that happened and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote out but\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know which at that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the ... Kevin ...\nAnd and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independence right you're undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back mhm that ad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat\nAnd with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's you know that she evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much Ira and record the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles been registered to joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dad come red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nPreserving Petro stopping centers almost half\nOf all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking it's easy to send hard earned dollars in time and searching for that elusive spot in the stress a safe place to park says something you should have\nTo worry about reserve it can help reserve is author of the truck smart asked for online service parking peace of mind et cetera et cetera now pay for parking with older one point and this is the ultimate reward\nTruckers quick question for you how\nDo you say entertained when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub TV or spotty wife fly no thank you me I like to one line to the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab\n... portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever mounted to your roof for storm till your day is over\nThen just shut them up in your sleep recap antennas are lightweight shut up and minutes and daughter Clara was like an action blood it gets even\nButter when there's no long term TV contract disappearing as you go programming you pay for only the ... actually use check it out a dish for my truck Doug gum parents fleet owners want to give your truckers the comfort of home on the road ...\nPerfect for leads to older TV you love to watch at home in the comfort of your cab\nAnd you're willing to have to put up with trucks dub GV ever find out more desperate much drudge dot com today restrictions apply\nIf you're a trucking industry professional then you immediately and then now and there's no one more in the nose and the readers of owner magazine written for executives and managers on air provides information on operation maintenance regulations and information technology but that's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "28"}
