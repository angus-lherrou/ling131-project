note that just came out late last night no cooperation of the allegations made by a two of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is according to an executive summary\nAre released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report the request was for an investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witness is with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the ... lawyers said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against Kavanaugh\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy got debt and

and close college friend upper mirror as a\nThird suppose that I witnessed refused to speak to investigators participation in FBI background check interviews is voluntary the supplemental background investigation was ordered by\nUh the White House at the request of the a committee\nA forty six page report is what it was and uh as we now know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses at that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and no cooperation to get\nThe right and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all along delayed delayed delight with the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater or I guess the stronger a foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed this nothing more nothing less put this off and hope that you can uh appeal\nTo either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even further and that's over it is\n\nI don't know what the vote will look like on Saturday Night or early Sunday Morning but it's going to happen\nCenter gains from South Dakota said and and called a cabinet and said he\nWill be there for the vote yet he will vote\nOr no matter what it takes for him to get back from his daughter's wedding on Saturday right now the\nVote could be anywhere from Saturday afternoon through late Saturday evening who knows him to Sunday Morning and I don't know at this point it uh but after they have the official cloture vote it will be a thirty our you know a clock ticking up for debate it could go less than thirty hours\nOr depending if the Democrats you know want to extend it\nAll right right now it looks like thirty hours yeah or if there's a lot of live t._v. coverage of it\nWhich may or may not be I I don't know but on a Saturday on a cable news channel as a very decent chance at any of them were all of them will be covering it live throughout the day\nThat that is the case during that thirty hour period uh your usual suspects who may be hopeful for twenty twenty Kamala Harris I'm Elizabeth Warren may take some time to you know get up and debate this or that or may have\nYou know a number of things if there's not that television coverage inside certainly there will be\nOutside
