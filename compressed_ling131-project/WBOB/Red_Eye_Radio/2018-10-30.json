I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety read I was just looking at a Fox News article from Newt Gingrich a B and remember they contract with America that that he had come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with because he's talking about ... proposed Republican pledge\nOn on on healthcare you and I talked about this a long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care's one Bolivian issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it it's their fault for not oh yeah solving the problem of health care and not going in with the plan right and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that the ... that they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nAnd they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they pat you know they they got rid of the individual mandate pass a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something that could cause them the house we'd stay to this over a year ago\nAnd he goes through all the different ah ah you know we were talking about the accomplishments that they have done and they should have talked about okay and here's a we plan to do the Republican promises for additional improvements and they go through everything protect patients with preexisting conditions\nWith again the state high risk pools ... reinsurance so everybody can do it but you know we talked about how you do that with state grants and things like that\nBut they didn't do it every member of the ... and on a new website as a candidate remember the whole block grant thing and we have and you said that night and that's out of the Newt Gingrich fight books and they they had to plan but they didn't do what they should have focused on the six months they had only been pounding it and they did not dry [noise]\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the preexisting condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states that states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drug supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure of the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan\nShould should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads\nLeading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah ... it's not going to work\nNow we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nBecause that's who he's preaching to but you're right with ah the Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with with Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then undid the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it and another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying\nAnd we we talked about that disconnect between twenty six team and the end of\nLast year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go editor point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it alive because it's one of the top issues that Americans care about\nWhat because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the set of it by the American people is is shifting on health care and this this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want and this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich was one thing the party didn't have well any desire to\nDo the Newt Gingrich wrote it because he saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way and we got criticism ... we got criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare I stopped stain it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was or what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which\nWas taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems\nRight\nSo you should have focused on solving the problems immediately that should've been the president and and and this is why we have said\nThat we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things it's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all and\nSo we don't have a monopoly running our health care system\nOf government monopoly running our healthcare system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for and they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand\nOn repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign it right because the president has shown that when he sticks by something like the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any kids fighting in a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks\nIt any keeps fighting in a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks the but the like about the president that despite the fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hardy shoes and one of the hardest teachers out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\nBut you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns the number one thing that this president did as candidate was do what do they do knowledge well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald ... what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well this regulation is the is the problem you have the right now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem\nYou have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily\nCould point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up as a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to curb\nWhat they can do\nIs get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now this choking hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nThe American people in premiums and so you\n... and ... and pregnant and when he got out and in payments to the insurance company up\nAnd and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't in his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care\nIs well within this we'll hop in a new unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all right\nWell and then that case he's going to have to start talking about it yeah 'cause\nOtherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore hell let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when really did mhm 'cause that was to cry and then the president probably had to admit no well no we did\nGet rid of all the bomb and care\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that's part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem we have with the right ... we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I did yes you didn't know we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy cost is coming from the regulation that is still in place the hospitals and employers\nBanned by what the you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the costs yeah eight and we consider to matter what age six six Ninety right I\n[noise] ... wrote on the radio [noise]\nJoin the
