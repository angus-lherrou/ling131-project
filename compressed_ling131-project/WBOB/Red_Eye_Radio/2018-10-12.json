S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices\nOn Amazon they do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier Ga for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly an update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump or the campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election ... the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\nPerkins Cooley who paid and opposition research from a a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump that they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of the well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will and both his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n... really know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine or after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of\nThe house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees Simpsons firmed up fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warns against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the ... say they're trying to find here's I either ... or they're going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up uh I don't think so what are they going to ask him about how well they're going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their\nRole or in\nThe uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does see\nOh he ... he yes from the department of justice yes yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right now on an official\nA blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know of one I don't know where there is any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money for ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do up as well do what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell and then finding the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oh I'll do there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yes\nThose are the questions that what those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind yes elite that's that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter] hey that was that out
