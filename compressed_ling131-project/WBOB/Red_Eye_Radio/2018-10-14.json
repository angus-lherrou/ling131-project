of the hour after the last caller of a\nYou know told us and said look I'm I'm a I'm I'm voting because uh I don't believe that ah you know\nPopular opinion or you know you should a substitute for\nUh the presumption of innocence and due process and I started thinking about it when you know you and I I said a lifestyle or the the one thing that I got out of the whole cabinet thing is the Democrats are trying to sell us that if you believe in due process and the mindset of due process and that the accusation alone isn't enough\nAnd you disagreed with them with this message think about this but if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nWith this message think about this but if you don't believe the accuser no matter what\nIf you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor than you are an enabler about rapist of a gang rapist\nThat's what they were trying to sell us think about that and that's why after ... when he said you know he's voting because of that that I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason to matlock to law and order from it because I think law and order started what an eighty nine\nOr ... I yes Eighteen eighty nine\n[laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows out there uh-huh\nRight for that and and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the American public ignorance does not mean stupid\nNow the Democratic leadership may think people are stupid we believe people may be uninformed we don't believe people are stupid and never had it in half\nIgnorance simply means you lack the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the facts and you can go search for the facts or that you're dumb it simply means you don't have the facts but whatever reason yes I I Will\nSay I do believe some people are stupid like those Republicans who made my taxes go up\n[laughter] and that other\nOf the [laughter] other than that we know problem with them [laughter] you know we have a problem with that we have a problem we have a problem with everybody let's be honest about trust me\nBut and and and so but but think about this ... the Democrats are trying to sell to the American public after how many decades of television shows pounding lawyer shows at odds over and over again where it has become\nAbsolutely crystal clear to any American out there you need evidence before you and convict somebody and they're saying no that think about that that's their biggest push\nGoing into an election mid term election is the fact that no no evidence doesn't matter only the allegation matters and evidence doesn't matter really\nThat's what you're trying to sell the American public\nAnd that's why when the last caller just the way that\nJust the way that he explained it\n\nThat no you you don't go public opinion doesn't decide public opinion does not decide\nYou have to look a in those house and Senate races you have to look at either the last midterm or separate the presidential race of twenty sixteen from the house and Senate races of twenty sixteen yes\nAfter the first midterm that any president goes through there often is a shift right so you can apply that generally speaking and we may just see that in the house\nBut don't count it don't count it just yet\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring your next pre or post trip inspection check all safety equipment including fire extinguishers\nTriangles and spirit fuses to make sure they're in the proper location in the event and emergency responders trying to locate the fire extinguisher it's crucial that it's in the proper place and easy to find th truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped\nBy a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is a service a TA truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shot [noise]\nWas a poor widow radio with record ...

relations spectacle regarding the moderate Republicans the head\nAnd the standard um go along to get along they have woken up and ah I'm Wondering if this is a an apt analogy I don't know how do they have ... but uh in the same way that\nThe u._s. was not aware that they were under attack by a Islamic has this stream is terrorists until nine eleven you know they have the ... bombing they had the uh\nThe Trade Center in Ninety three they weren't really woke up in aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't think that the moderate Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme left wing extremism is at war with conservatism\nUntil last week\nOr not I would certainly not not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even a a a poll politically a death not necessarily any logically but no I don't think it's inflammatory what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an advice so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that and and I think we're\nYour analogy I I think if you look at that I think also which I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them and the center now are clearly\nNo I mean when you have to think about this when you have a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins being the ones\nWho were the ... that really carried if it but not so much with columns but certainly Lindsey Graham carrying the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states them and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't dare they ought to do that will be remembered though ... in terms of their mark\nOn this event no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that I wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me that the situation comic\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a high camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that is what's going to happen was that oh okay I see it\nBy the way we never talked about hike a high camps explanation ... that she made her decision by turning off the TV and watching just his body language\nRight yeah oh my God yeah just kill yourself or you and your who you just give yourself no chance of winning well ... they have day but it was like ... you know that was pretty much cutting the stream and then you see [noise] the\nWhole well downward spiral that continued after\nThat [noise]\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy is in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a a ... basically the ... the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to ... is\nHe the U. S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon they do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nUh this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier da for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change the outcome of the election ... the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\n... who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got\nA information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting on verified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see ... GPS was a part of it well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n... really know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty nine\nOr after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons firmed up fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course all or is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't I don't write are are they going to ask him about a a who\nHe believes is the best running back ever and the national football league get if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up or I don't think so what are they going to ask him about finding I Would I Begin to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed\nAt fusion GPS yes the inspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he\nHe ... he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because because they were done internally they right on right\nDepartment of justice yeah well yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and then again if those are ... that that's the number of it right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because you shouldn't GPS doesn't want to call for the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut ah so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with\nA you know uh the professionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm you just have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then\nWhat do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with the actual Russia collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is going is that the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf a fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know about I don't know where there is any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite while the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell at heightening the time it was interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under I'll I'll do there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and\nWhy would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's been criminalizing is from\nYes\nThose are the questions that went to ... those are questions on the investigator would have run into their ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter] hey I'm they thought he was that out loud at the bottom [laughter] sorry [laughter] the microbes on ... six Ninety read I\nGo with what I told him he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nIt's a show listen anywhere
