California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on a Radio Welcome to the show\nYou guys could show as usual thanks like I had a ... and I don't know if it's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly um super slander a stock report or\nOther nutty whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts to agree with you guys are going to continue to and from the sky um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet because he's not the same rules of capping off them for anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was when I say brought in\nSlow them down but we give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there maybe there's ... they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the leak and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with\nThe link to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have in a case\nIn ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible for getting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think ... part of that and they have in any case that way that was him yes you have any eliminate because it's clear that gives the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash on the ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that there are these joined us in spite is yours was invited to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every a predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge or that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that ... that survived it all was Dr forge claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so\nThat's why I and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ad in any case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just on the doctors were using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean it go in going after Cabot all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says that you got to make your case is the worst probable cause while I think it might have happened\nThat's not good enough no no absolutely not so and they could just do ... percent only\nWell I'm In a while because we're the king the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play and pursuing this in the media pursuing this and be charging a ... in in filing suit in the New Yorker sworn statement the New Yorker\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing it that and you would have a case at least to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens\nAnd couldn't find first hand knowledge and may be in this case it would be responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that to happen that he's a ... suit and of course the New Yorkers printing up [noise]\nWell I Know but you know ... well my point is we go point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a would share this fire at a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation there and I so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have that in their promise their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make a charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one that ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no that was the guy\nThat was ... who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese now with I don't know what they can get them but\nWhat did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the or the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada was responding to when\nWe were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying\nAbout it so uh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is or in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah or any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't ah when the seats that they should be winning a in a\nFirst term of a president in the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nYou know if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want her charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins and things gives me you're living a lie to them on ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law\nLie for everyone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody would agreement that's what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told that I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael ... we went that doesn't make ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from\nMichael I don't give it to my God I don't have to [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went dead mhm that doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's\nOn that yeah and that's that that's really what it comes down to is that ah we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe've said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that didn't\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public over and over and over\nFor a very very long time eight six six Ninety
