states lowers your workers will be again ... lower overlooked lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked\nAnd they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because fewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... main goal we talked about this yesterday was to have\nCompanies in the United states producing it here in selling it elsewhere well by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite\nRight there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere and because of all the rules and regulations we'll put on cars in all of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say Canada\nMexico and ... and the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it and and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I not the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt car production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something going to say fine you're gone automation\nYou know automation a that comes in come comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating pardon\nWell and keep in mind and two thousand eight when the\nDomestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms their foreign business was what was keeping them alive\nYou you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect ... based on economics which is how people respond when sentiment disincentive ... not in my opinion how people respond yeah

[laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals who will be screaming for transparency the first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n[laughter] [noise]\nAh you know it's interesting that seems like a ... for a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation of sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that\nTrump committed collusion and they want to find out\nWhere everyone and wanting to release it to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nOr you know beyond that a typical party line number of just St Louis you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which\nMeans there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think\nThat it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparency\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to well we talked about earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week and and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant a application\nAnd and and those\nTwenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared person is going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said 'cause we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guys just started talking about casually on the air and saying yeah I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know to get it because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies\nOr we're going to release it ah but ah we're a ... we have so much action from our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're released something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because it's a former CIA director and talking about OK what or ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and and information and Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to get into the inspector general of the United states whose ... the inspector general of\nThe department of justice and whose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice\nBecause you look at that scenario imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly uh you have Kelly in the room with him and then that advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly look ... and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require Horwitz\nThe inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes but you take the politics\nOut of it because you let the G do all the investigation on it tell us what happened here\nThe ice she's going to have\nAccess to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans\nOn oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that yeah gee has access to it directly yet so the I. G. takes this\nAnd the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this ah on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president\nWhile the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nI'm Out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue you take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to\nTo be handed over and you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yes just declassified part of advice because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you a context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about a ... that you know ... initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing right\nAnd the media is not covering it really the mainstream media idea even seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only he only looks at corruption\nRight that's what he's still he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked\nAt it already and it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say about Russia probe right which one which one because I read it said oh Russian pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know could because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but the the limit for Mueller's investigation right but in the tweet said Russian probe right and I went oh\nThat must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] [laughter] right might not be though it may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did what any mother he said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the\nPattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right yeah what was that pattern of behavior\nLeaks to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump or almost or may be exactly zero zero\nSo you have the situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department\nThat are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if there's an redacted classified material had damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case\nWould he also turned it over to the inspector general if it were because it wouldn't serve him\n... I don't not required to turn it over to the ... right but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any\nInformation that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of just I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something on him ... OK okay then well then it was actually wanted to show it was legit ... that it's going to go OK okay right\nThat it is that the whole thing was legitimate rights and it was based on something real\nWe haven't heard that and if that were the case when the president had it when he turned it over to the ... he he isn't required to do that eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nDo for your goals for the Sixers on radio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the free minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you by freight line or drugs", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "03"}
