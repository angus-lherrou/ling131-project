they had it right in the headline\nThat headline was right mega millions world record one point six billion dollar jackpot one apparently winning tickets in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently started after winning I Would just just that would be\nSo funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what does that person going to a group of people going through right now if they know talk about freak out mode\nThey there's someone wrote the story again you know because they\nThey did this series on a on cable I Know all those stories of people winning the lottery and it just ended horribly I'm at someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt that when you claim the prize\nThe word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nThen people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it does mine\nFor them to get a ... at the at the psychology behind it or wait a minute if everybody has a right to my earned money ... well then they have a double rights to my non earned lucky money especially because how is that prize constituted\nBy me buying a ticket and you won the prize [laughter]\nHad a piece of it a sense of entitlement to the Supreme Court and I don't know a lot of money now yeah exactly you know it gets [noise]\nBut um you know that's that's the dynamic especially you know people who are famously wealthy but forget about that people who wins something [noise] and don't burn it [noise] people get jealous very easily [noise]\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop knocking at your door you know and\nWant to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that away if you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more exciting and when I was younger me winning the lottery these days would be like what a hassle [laughter] well I thought about it would change my life too much I I\nThought about that kind of money because after taxes uh it's gonna be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall prices at one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes there was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a minute [laughter] and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and parking anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you going to take that I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's\nNothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] died out to be clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life\nI have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who are back at one time was working for a a multibillion her um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day ...\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's not enough time in the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy\nOut a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener thinks we are [noise] um but but the point was is\nNow this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to do\nI couldn't have lost anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money and saw is set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to demand that you can you can do that legally in in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money\nMhm 'cause as I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of follow what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but\nThat means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws\nThere are laws about raising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I mean it's still going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone my life is life fight that right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I Do I I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get\nTo do and so I'm I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know what I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I was just one dumped thought that goes through your mind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nIt's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think uh like it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other job allow that we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that outside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up and do those today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse where the end of the show we grab our lunch pail isn't going to do it that's what the feeling as it is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for so ah but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think about every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life were you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my ... because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it\nAh I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy told his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about I was at this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was look I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealthy or like the the ... the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other thing your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the time is one of\nThe that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the big lottery right and was actually what the ah ... kidnapped or some of his family was kidnapped or whatever I play right when the money yeah you\nKnow so you need at that point when you when that kind of money you probably need security so your whole life was destroyed once you have security once ... once you have a possibly not I'm not a policy per se what are we learning I urge people are security when I couldn't ... yeah\nYou know I it it would be very different way of life I I don't know how you make it work eight six six Ninety red eye\nBooks with what I told him that he ... he wrote", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "24"}
