Ted Cruz [laughter]\nThat our point of the other twenty filthy we're remembering their member and and this this is why again a lot of times what happens\nIn her party between a a you know a couple of candidates means nothing right right right and when you think about it broke her member to remember what Trump was you know Trump was promoting the conspiracy theory remember that\nThat Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination talk\nAbout the whole vote your conscience well that's [laughter]\nThat's what we said anything anything since then the ... because that was a minor it's like well don't you did you hear what he's done well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months ago at your\nFather was part of the plot that led to the assassinate assassination of a president that's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat\n[laughter] he killed Kennedy\nAnd you know and today there will be a really yeah you're right now and and I had a bigger place they were in a small place move a bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted ... supporters are lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early Sunday\nTo get him [laughter]\nAt this rally I don't know I don't know if that that's been um\nOr they were they were showing some people the basically it was some reporters that we're showing some pictures on social media uh people uh that were camped out I mean these are real pictures it looks like people that are supporters\nAnd there are there basically on the sidewalk waiting to get in for a rally but doesn't start until the next day this was a Sunday evening there in Houston\nRight ... ... this is this is not\nNo no there's not it is not this is not going to buy\nA game or whatever [noise] nah its support someone in spirit that he wanted to vote\nYou know a better guess at that right\nYeah it it gets here it is a a a dense midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day and this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to ... cents I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I'll I'll watch it on the might call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because\nMy was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike ...\nI don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at it more or as investigators in partisans\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and and everything there that we are going to find out that probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to giving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his\nSalacious unbearable fight information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have at this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\nIt could be there again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's like you are now I don't I don't see it I look I I think\nThat there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out which\nWould make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nRight or the Mueller investigation at all but not and see I don't know what a a a ... report does\nThe if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would ah issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be inaccurate report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not as that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete um what I Know what the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that sold points to it but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump colluding with the Russians I just\nBecause where where it would be the evidence if there is not going to be in a movement on ... if it is just to report\nA movement on the indictment if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ... probably will never see those ... right\nBecause it and that will be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's something I noticed the landing on the\nLast two years you had accusations got just as good as her\nExcept for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else ask what ... what we asked why would the White House says it to the inspector general ... we're talking about the\nBet is that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you sending it to the idea the only reason the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this why is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen red and people have just to refresh you win rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\n... the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice for almost Twenty one different pages but uh and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know released it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general to look at it and expedite\nWhatever that are bad hoard yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it oh\nCorruption and how how to our allies know what would be how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't\nSo why are you studying the I. G. because one region you started the id is that you believe you because you declassified have spotted a criminal event and you know\nThat as\nThe the role of the I. G. and because of the power that they have the G can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get within the department of justice and the White House\nWouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war which and see what horror which can find in horn which has access to every corner milk and cranny and the ...\nAnd and since that happened what almost three weeks ago McGregor maybe you and I said what are we missing here is that what what are we missing alcohol but he also talking about this are we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety red eye\n[noise] eight six six months [noise]\n[noise] right now has he and Petro stuffing centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven\nAnd not to mention the ...
