California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on a radio walk into the show\nYou guys could show as usual thanks like I had a ... and I don't know if it's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly\nUm super slander a stock report or\nOther not whatever his name is uh uh I think that do some I think I think it may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if the judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yep he ... not under the same rules about capping off them or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nBrought in it would slow them down I think that would give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there and maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the link to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have in a case\nThere Dr ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible are forgetting his name out there and that you could see I think\nPart of that and they have in any case there that was that was him yes the Eddie ... eliminate because I think what they're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash on the ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ...\nThey already the rice is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at these joined us in spite of the news was invited to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as a capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that ... that survived it all was Dr forge claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and and again I don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor ward right I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right ah but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean it go in going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case and the worst of probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough\nNo no absolutely not so and they could just do ... personally\nWell I mean well because we're the ... the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play and pursuing this in the media pursuing this and be charging you a ... and in filing sue the New Yorker sworn statement the New Yorker\nAh for publicizing it and and and publishing at that and you would have a case at least to the extent that while the New York times went out of their way and interviewed dozens\nAnd couldn't find first hand knowledge and made the in this case it would be responsible decision not to pursue the story and compare that are forced to al ... a ... and of course the New Yorkers printing up [noise]\nWell I Know but you know ... ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next and on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy at a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation there and I so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they and I'm not in their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault\n\nWas politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stopped doing any of these now with I don't know\nWhat are they get them but what did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's me which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November twenty sixteen and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right\nUh you know ... or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nTrying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah uh any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate it so we don't know what she what she wants you it's proving it\nYes and and our point was Eric just said that will there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen\nUh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't ah when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed mhm uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nYou know if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty wouldn't want her charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm\nAnd\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sugar and salt we laugh when it said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins gives me you're the one the ... and ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for\nEveryone in the United states\nIn the United states knows its ally for\nEveryone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody wouldn't agreement that is what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told that I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael ... we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz Michael I\nGive it to my ... like they don't have the [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went dead mhm 'cause it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and at the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on that yeah and that's that\nThat's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\n\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this will play out in the public over and over and over\nFor a very very long time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOver for six weeks later you were on the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested Bowers lead is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to run I radio for up to date to information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter for information on tour stop advanced\nAnd promotions if you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be injured when great prices at hash\nTag tack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nThere is never a bad time to get your tough back which is why now is a good time to take a look at the western star forty nine hundred\nWidow lasting heritage of toughness the forty nine hundred is built to deliver years a flawless performance with terrible components and build construction and a space is quiet cab\nBus with the availability of the industry's only sixteen leader engine the Detroit duty sixteen getting your tough back you know forty nine hundred also means plenty of power and efficiency find your dealer at western star dot com", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Jacksonville", "day": "08"}
