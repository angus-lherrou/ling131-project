estimated jak fond of one point six billion dollar where\nI remember getting the polio vaccine I remember getting three or four separate shots\nAs a youngster now they put all this stuff together and sort of one big\nUh there are there are more what what actually when children of actually the whole controversy about you know where the mercury or aluminum whatever's in some of these vaccines and what it does to our children in terms of autism et cetera et cetera et cetera\nPutting that aside what are the things that are in the normal shots the kids get a whether I'd be brought what age they're supposed to get these\nOh boy so we just covered as Ilya and things that\nI'm ... ... there's a huh\nSo you want to go over the schedule or whether you know we went to like\nWhat did you do with Amanda your daughter when I came to get vaccines what did she get vaccinated\nFor everything that the pediatrician asked me\nTo recommend is that she gets the only thing she didn't get was this\nUm ... ... later on the women are getting the HDTV yeah and and we talked a lot about that in ... in the Susan\nWas made not too although later on in life she did but I'm ... that was the only one that was a a difficult decision for\nFor everybody and but\nEverything else the standard you know the tea Syria tetanus protests\nThe ... um ... all of this\nI made sure she got and ah\nYou know autism is a report this week it's ... it's consistent over there's over a hundred genes involved you know I I think that this is more of a genetic issue and\nAnd uh ... and\nYou know there may be other things playing a role but uh you know you see one kid's life taken because they didn't get vaccinated and it just tears your heart out and as a physician I've seen too many kids die because they didn't get vaccinated\nWell what about the other claims of autism and things that bothers people to have your own or a signing your child through a life of\nA vet the of the degree of problems that are caused by autism and there seems to be conclusive evidence that it may in fact be caused or might be caused by ah the ingredients as some of these ...\n... you know we had a couple of years ago we had one of the world's experts on sharpening member from one of the children's hospitals have you remember\n... and ... in Philadelphia and you know he addressed that I think rather eloquently and you know he talked about why some of the studies may show it and he talked about you know the quality of science and and you know ...\nI\nYou know a guy like that puts his whole life long reputation on the line when he makes a statement\nLike that and and you know I I just ah I see the other side I see kids who died needlessly 'cause they don't get vaccinated and then the\nProblem is is that when you put your kid around the other kids you put so many children at risk and in order to get everybody safe there's this collective\nEffort that you need to make to keep everybody safe so if you don't vaccinate your own kids you not only putting your own kids at risk you're putting everyone else's kids at risk ... so it certainly\nIs food for a very controversial thing and there's a line in the sand some people really believe in and some people really don't\n... it's a tough one I Know that you know you get one child who has in in in science this true true unrelated and that's the problem with the kids are taking all these vaccines and then they suddenly get autism\nAnd you want to so easily associated with whatever's been taken are done are given I mean I deal with this once a day at least every day where\nPeople want to ... want to uh\nAssociate any adverse effect they have in life with any medicine they're taking and often is true but you have to be careful because it's not always to you may have also had a cookie that day did the cookie caused the problem\nOr you know cookies or good for you well you know that's that's the difficulty of ... correlations scientists notice you know correlation this tells you nothing about cause and effect\nRight by the way when your daughter tells her friends that you're a doctor or whatever\nThat is what happens under the circumstances a good doctor well known accomplished physician is there any stigma that goes with that good or bad what are our children are usually proud of what their parents do\nWell I usually have to put them at ease when they meet me you know they're just thinking you know you must walk on on it you know and mortar\nAnd [laughter] and and you know the salt water that right and the gazing eyes and and\nYou know then they want to ask me all these questions and then they want to tell me how badly they want to be a doctor what do they do or how they would never be a doctor and blah blah but they're delightful I Love dealing with them and interacting with them and\nSort of a twist on my son to the doctor my dad the doctor\nAnd and you know ... you know kids are funny ... when when they're

I bring it up and it's important we know about\nThis is out of the CDC this week that at least Ninety two people in twenty nine states have been infected with a drug resistant strain of salmonella and

day how show Dr can crime has his ear from lake cardiology Panama Dora Florida lake cardiology numbers three five to seven three five fourteen hundred why would you want that number well think about it from it it\nCan go to the radio with me for a long time\nI respect his abilities respect his smarts his process and not only as a cardiologist but I guess the general practitioner even though that's not what a shingle says\nHe for me represents the epitome\nOf someone who is devoted to their craft\nAnd so lots of people from Florida but all over the country go to visit can they hear him on the radio and they think I'm going to see him I Want to get some kind of help information whatever it is from him\nAnd so he's there at your service on your side it three five to seven three five fourteen hundred if you have ... go visit with Dr ken and you'll love I'm like I Do three five to seven three five fourteen hundred okay\nWe can love each other and not agree and so as the cold and flu season is on the way\nI think the best medicine is preventative medicine to bolster your immune system my immune system\nSo let's come up with a foundational approach here you've got yours Ken safeguarding ones immune system I when I talk about fruits and vegetables and all of that stuff and what people get when they don't get a that's a dream but I think I have a strong immune system based on lots of different things\nBut if you don't ah and then you really do need some sort of\nImmune protocol I guess I'm so what are you there there's been a lot of talk about two different kinds of flu vaccines this year is that true\nWell what do I do to prevent the flu and it's just so timely because I only ladies and\nGentlemen when you go to see him he'll do appalling for you to what do I do to prevent\nFlu [laughter] All right um so and this time of year it's it's it's really critical because you should try and get this done by the end of October\nSo basically lifestyle is very important to say the things we talk about keeping your heart healthy of the same things that boost your immune system eating a healthy diet getting exercise enough sleep washing the stress getting downsized body weight all these things keep your immune system optimal\nAnd then on top of that the flu bugs the past years especially last year killed a lot of Americans and the other thing we know about the recent flu bugs and this is ... this is really a caught my attention is\nThat in the year after you get the flu your risk of a heart attack is dramatically higher so yes and and so by preventing the flu you're not only\nPreventing the immediate death you may have an hospitalization and all that goes along with that you're also dramatically lowering the risk of you having a heart attack and the next year\nSo what do I do I'll tell you what I Do I Do all of those things I talked about to optimize my lifestyle\nI uh\nAlso get a vaccine a flu vaccine and or I Will be getting mine and the next week or so\nI Try to get it this year especially before the end of October you know usually we talk about between Halloween and uh Thanksgiving is the best time but but this year I think the bugs going to be a little earlier and and uh the recommendations been to try to get it in before the end of October\nUm in terms of the ...\nPrint vaccines I think what you're talking about is once you get over sixty five or if you have any um chronic illnesses any immuno suppressive issues you have to talk to your doctor this is on a case by case basis whether you need the high\nConcentration of ... or a second injection most of us don't put ... you know it's just good to ask the doctor whether you do and for most of us it's just you know pull down the sleeve get it in the arm once and it's not so bad\nDo you give yourself a shot no no no no no I have one of my assistance give it to me why would you just give it to yourself because that would not be a good idea you know you\nJust ... you might ... ... it's just not a good idea you could [laughter]\nYou know ... it's hard to get into the right spot you need three ... you would need you need at least two hands to\nDo it right really yeah so I guess I had a third hand I couldn't do it but I wouldn't even think of doing it myself it ... it would not that would not be a wise thing to do right you know what I'm saying any doctors ever given themselves shots\nOh by the first ... where you put a tube into the body and inject contrast I looked at the circulation and measure of pressures around the hard that the only way that could get done was by a cardiologist actually putting the tube and himself so\nI Know that people were inflicted things on themselves that doesn't mean I'm lining up or recommending that that's the best way to do it [laughter] I\nI think there's that many safety issues involved and and ah whether it's done or not and whether it's right or not I don't think it's the same thing\nRight so here in some of the uh journals that I look at as a someone who is interested in me off of the has the right way of putting it but I Am a big believer in supplements was you know\nSo I take garlic I\nI take a ... okay ah\nI take zinc and echinacea\nUm and that's what I Do for my immune system and in addition to eating pretty well or not always in my perfect with what I eat a but I Am\nPretty the other thing that we have to discuss in this prevention mode and you don't want to become obsessed about it but his hand washing and just be careful what you touch because that's\nThe way you you get this is by your hands touching your face and you know you'll notice doctors they never touch their face with their hands and you know they're putting their hands are they all wear plastic gloves well we're always we're ... yeah and we're we just you\n...

is large you were just talking about the birth rates going down so that families\nAre smaller these days but if you come from a bigger family looks like you have a lower chance of getting cancer and my reading that right\nThat's the conclusion of this study this weekend bam see cancer that people from larger families are less likely to get cancer than those from smaller families\nDoes the link between family size and cancer risk is independent of income levels of urbanization in age family size includes not just parents in their children but also members of the extended family in the household\nFamily life can be stressful but can also provide good emotional environments that can boost the person's resistance to disease including cancer family members supporting one another and\nFollowing a healthy lifestyle they also provide protection against cancer\nSo in your estimation as a professional here uh this is in fact we're having lower birth rates than the problem of cancer will increase\nOne of the big bang theory was that one of the fact is yes and and but cancer in the whole because there are many other factors affecting it is declining it but this would is working against that decline\nThanks to the doctor can grown out for being here helping us understand several more issues that are important to understanding how we live in America these days fifty

of the eighty fifth world series\n[noise]\nAnd this week in Nineteen eighty nine during a game against his old team the evidence in boilers hockey greats Wayne Gretzky breaks greenhouse National Hockey league career scoring record is\nOne thousand eight hundred and fifty points Gretzky retired in Nineteen Ninety nine holding records for most career goals most career assists than most career point two thousand eight hundred and fifty seven ... pi hard radio weekend sports\n'cause there's definitely a few twists and turns out that you took your life that were kind of unexpected at the start right\nYeah yeah so for people who aren't familiar with the book or can't really divine from the title you clearly had a very interesting experience with the Ku Klux Klan or the organization as they they seem to like to call themselves and that also kind of happened on chance how did that start\nA newspaper ad in the uh one of the papers\nAre scanning and one day I saw this ad says ... Klux Klan for information and then there was a PO box so I wrote a note to the PO box or you know find myself as a white supremacist a racist ... and a\nScientist I use the language of hate that they talk in a sign my real name which was a mistake but it turned out for the better sign my real name and gave a wrote the undercover phone line or down there was a trade school at the time and mailed it also forgot about it\nAnd so this was this was a few years now what are your police career and you were uh you're you're kind of service yourself ... future ambitions of this one I assume you know after being on the job for Europe as having too much fun and he was making twice as much money as a college graduate\nAnd the teaching profession so I I ... I banned in that I [laughter] fair\nEnough so what so you you make it ... you you say a couple of times it's both in the book and the movie that you using your real name me to you know a significant difference of this how ... how what would have been different had you not use your real name what do think the difference would have been\nWell the very fact that Ron stalwarts was one of their klansmen and runs goers was investigating them simultaneously a\nMeeting with these people talking to them on the phone that would've been slightly different because uh I wouldn't have a membership card today that says Ron ... I wouldn't have a certificate membership signed by David do that says ... worth and that's one of these are unique things about this ... is a\nThey were totally hoodwinked by Ron stalwarts times too\nYeah definitely 'cause I it's definitely a unique situation 'cause\nI remember seeing on Facebook things like that about you know certain people who befriended Klan members are transitioned you know them away from the Klan but never someone who was the clan member and wasn't lily white [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's what made this story rather unique\nSo what made you want then you know decades later to come back and then turn this into a book\nWell what made me come back to El Paso was this woman sitting here beside me or the love of a woman brought me back to El Paso what is the best decisions I ever made\nAnd so you have to kind of reconnected from you know after graduating from us in high school in decades later got reconnected over this book is that right\nNow um we reconnected back in ... when he can ... classmates I'm\nOne of our classmates trying to put a reunion together and we jumped in and said yes I'm In El Paso or help he was in Utah and he said I'll help at least I you know I said give me a call being as it's better than doing it on the Internet and we just started talking talk for about six months\nUm eight nine times a day oh wow um and then we met in Vegas\n[laughter] and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas right ah we're not quite in this case [laughter] well yeah we're on the air I'm a good time you know reconnected as friends and then we started dating long distance for\nSix years wow two years ago he moved down proposed we got married roughly a year ago by the Catholic Church\nOh well congratulations on that so where does the the creation the start of the book come into play so you all reconnected before that\nWhen did the the serious consideration of telling that story start\nWell I had always toyed with the idea of doing it um I Would tell people about what happened and we'd get a chuckle but I never talked to any media or anything\nAnd around two thousand eight or show I was at a conference police conference in California\nAnd it was a vendor they're selling books I walked up too much they didn't want to hear an interesting story said yeah I pull my membership card out shoulder toy while when you stop laughing and he said there's got to be a story behind this and there is and I told the toy\nYou said if you write that are printed\nThat okay and I walked off forgot about it and it wasn't until two thousand Thirteen\nUm that I sat down and\nStarted writing I wrote the first thirty pages didn't like it toward up the way ... for about a several days and then picked up to pen and paper and started writing again and\nPretty much know Scott for nine months in a\nWhat China was satisfied that everything was kosher or a sent off to him I might add that in between when I was writing I Would be sending a\nSegment seven to pass the via email um she would read it she's ... desire to read it so I let her read and she would offer some critique here they're some of which I incorporate it [laughter] the\nOnly good suggestions I'm sure\nHe's very good [laughter] and uh when I finished writing nine months later a\nGuy he rented rented\nAnd I mean to be clear this is a story from the very beginning of your career but otherwise I mean you had a a long and successful career as a\nA law enforcement officer in many different capacities right yes and it's this just happened to be right pretty close to the beginning of it again all all in Colorado at this point in time\nIs this something is that usual for some like some of the most interesting kind of a while the stuff that happened in your career to happen like kind of right at the start\nI couldn't say [laughter] I didn't plan on this or you're just dropped in my lap or this happened when I was twenty five years old I'm I joined the department at the age and Nineteen as it could that are\nAt the age of twenty\nTwenty two I was assigned to the a\nDetective division as a narcotics ah undercover narcotics investigator or I was at that time the youngest\nAre in the history of the department and the only black in the history of the department are being detected division so this clan investigation occur and about a three years after I got assigned to the detective division\nSo there was a lot going on in between and\nFor people like me who have no memory of that point in time 'cause I wasn't alive at that point in time what was uh\nWhat was you know the the state of society likely in particularly involving you know white supremacy and and those are good but also in the book you write also about the what we now kind of call the anti war is what morphed into the antifa movement but was actually I'm a bit more\nKind of communist base at the time would be a good way to describe more of a Marxist ideology\nBut what was going on in society as time you got to remember when I joined the apartment in Seventy two um we were just barely four years away from ah when America and a major cities in America were under fire or in some cases they were burning because of the race riots or\nConnect to civil rights movement a\nDetroit was on fire or New York had his problems I'm not a lot of things were going on at that time and we were just four years or so removed from it um tension was not as high as it was during that period of time but um\nThere was a degree of a [noise] a\nSettlement and put it that way [noise] and uh\nPeople still didn't trust the police especially ah the black community um\n[noise] so you had\nA those issues of fresh that we're now we're prevalent Mm [noise]\nYeah [noise] there America America was an interesting a\n\nDay but there's a time yeah definitely sounds like so is\nIt in all of that you still wanted to at least at least initially temporarily via police officer\nCatch\nAny doubt about that I'm\nBeing a police officer was uh once I made the decision to commit to it being a police officer was um\nMy ultimate goal and being a successful one obviously\nWhat what ended up drawing yet to that profession I get initially pretended to be temporary to facilitate a different one but then ah\nJust what made it something that you wanted to stay with [noise]\nUh I actually liked job after I made the decision to stick with it I like job\nImmediately\nI mean you can kind of just picked out to your your counterpart later diversification just kind of on the fly there I just out of thin air just thinking about who would might fit and be able to work with you as you were still on the phone right\nWell that didn't come about until ah he agreed to meet with me and that's when I had to figure out who am I going to pull this off\nAnd that's what I came up with the idea of a referring him to a one of the narcotic ah detectives who in the book I refer to his truck in the movie it's Adam Driver playing flipped Zimmerman ... um when he said when can we meet a\nI immediately thought of Chuck in at that moment the plan was put in motion to choke would be my uh avatar\nI mean it's amazing that that that could even happen but I mean one of the more interesting things that happened as you were in that process that part of the meeting is then how you actually ended up in contacts with David Duke\nBecause the the interesting thing I mean obviously this is before you know YouTube Internet even anything like that so the Clinton had these essentially the propaganda phone numbers be a good way to put it\nThey have phone numbers for um various things uh one number I saw it on their reading their newspaper was had a number of cars are called voice of the clan and if you call that number you could hear pre recorded message by David do\nOr promoting clan propaganda ideology\nAnd a one day I called the voice of the clan and lo and behold he picked up the phone and answered it and uh\nI asked him who is is he said this David Duke uh\nI said the\nGrand wizard and you see the scene in a movie as we said yes and um we just started talking and ah he had to go to a rally\nAs he called the meeting a but he said he hoped\nTo talk to me in the future and I've said a thank you Mr Duke ah be in touch with you I hung up and I thought to myself oh hell\n[laughter] maybe a different word there but yeah understandably so [laughter]\n'cause ... yeah I mean David do still around today obviously and you've had some a more interesting interactions with him recently that we'll get to hear in a bit but I mean he ... at the time he was the head honcho the clan in America [noise]\nUh not technically what it was the Klan first of all is a bunch of groups around the country there is no single group called the Ku Klux Klan um\nPeople wake up in the morning decided they hate everything that's a non white and they form a clan group and buy their robes or make their robes and they're often running I mean\nUh that's part of the danger to uh this particular group as you can focus on any one individual one area of the country they are all over the are all over and they go by different names\nAt that time in Nineteen Seventy eight when this took place David Duke was probably the premier leader of the clan group in America and probably had the largest one he was well known for his um\n[noise] a effort to change the face of the land the images and plan\nHe didn't wear a three piece suit soon I mean he didn't wear his clan robe and public only three piece suit as he was very articulate a he was an actress Julio typical southern uh klansmen that you see in a a depicted in movies or he was the direct opposite\nUm he was one heck of a debater\nAnd um he would appear on the uh talk shows go Donahue had him on numerous times\nAnd um he would a debate issues with the audience and we feel and uh he got an actual following as a result um that was a threat to David Duke is he made\nRacism in hate marketable for the mainstream\nHe was espousing a philosophy that believe it or not the Republican Party today is spouses or regarding um [noise] uh issues such as a formative action education um\nImmigration what Donald Trump was saying during the campaign was nothing new ... David Duke sand in forty\nYears ago I heard it and I'm David when we saw David Duke was applauding it in the modern day as well yes and as you said try to state his own resurgence as of recently as well but so at the time again dealing with him he was trying to trying to make it a a kinder gentler face of the clan for that that moment in time\nAnd I understand that at a certain point that there there's a scene in the movie you know major spoilers but ... doesn't disagree or forever as a result of the movie no no no big surprise there but\nYou actually took a picture with than I did and I don't have that\nPicture in any longer I've lost in but [noise] um [noise] [laughter] David Duke came into town [noise] more publicity blitz as we called it\nMakes your answers on radio shows TV shows that should everywhere good ... good a recruitment purposes and he was getting death threats from um\nThe progressive labor party a group of communist humid or their honored protesting when\nMy chief called me into his office that morning and said ah we're getting these threats I don't want anything happening to this man in my city we don't have anyone else available so I'm a signing you to be is a\nPersonal security and your chief [laughter] I\nWas in the investigation was still going on at this period in time right oh I was talking to David Duke uh once or twice a week and I mean in the movie there's a certain callousness I don't care not my problem on the on the part of the actor playing the chief\nWas it really like that you know no okay good [laughter] because they say well sure you got this investigation and which many things and many people's lives could be ruined but ... you know just go do what they thought\nThe chief was very supportive of my investigation he authorized that investigation when a certain people in their parliament didn't want to ... to proceed forward\nOr some of the chief was one of my supporters but he made a decision a strategic decision that I didn't agree with nor did my sergeant money insisted on it and um\n[noise] uh that was the closest we came to probably blowing this investigation was when I had to meet David Duke uh\nAfter this being given this Simon and introduced myself to it um because in the room was David Duke uh\nRed Wilkins the Colorado grand dragon or stay leader who I was also talking on the phone ... and Ken Oakdale the Colorado Springs organizer who initiated the first call with me I was talking to all three of these people on the phone at various points and they're all in the road together\nBye bye side when I Walk up and introduced myself to David Duke and Tony mom you're security and at that moment um\nPucker factor was very very hot [laughter] but uh [noise] was uh we got to talk and then I realized that they didn't recognize my voice they had no clue I was very comfortable there was nothing ah about it so uh\nDuring the course of our meeting I told him I said Mr do nobody will believe me when I tell them that uh I was a bodyguard would you mind taking a picture with me\nHe said no not at all now I had bought a Polaroid just a matter of camera with me to get a picture with it um your plan this noise did not I ... I had planned on taking a picture but I didn't plan on what transpired of what you see in the movie what happened was when he agreed to take the picture\nI gave the camera to chop the white rounds to our ... you know he was there he was right there and I figure well why not\nSo I gave a camera chug I got in the middle with Fred Wilkins a grand dragging on my left David newcomer right and I put my arm and their shoulders\nRed workers started was hilarious he was laughing [laughter]\nDavid ... didn't think it was hilarious he push my arm away very jelly and said I'm Sorry but I Can't be seen in a photo with you like that I said I understand excuse me\nAnd this is when I got pissed off can be seen in a photo with me watch this\nI Walk up to Chuck it I said on the count of three snap the photo I went back stood with my as down by my my waist said one to another ... three I raised my hand and put them back on your shoulders and pull them in close choked snap the picture David Duke bolted away from me to grab the pitcher and I beat him do it [laughter]\nAnd uh God he tried to snatch it outta my hand and I said if you touch me I Will arrest you for assault other police officer that's uh about five years in prison don't do it [laughter] you know in the movie you see conversation taking place between David Duke and John David Washington with Elaine May ... that didn't happen\nDavid Duke simply glared at me with the most intense look of hatred you can imagine and I go back at him with a little smirk on my face [laughter] and um\nIt seemed like forever probably lasted no more than five seconds or show he turned around and walked away went over to his group of followers who were standing there stunned and or\nShortly thereafter started launching into one of his white supremacy speeches which I and just destroyed by the way [laughter] yeah very kinda clearly so\n... and so you had multiple conversations both kind of in\nPerson but mostly on the phone with David do but you also had some more some more recent ones as well right", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "20"}
