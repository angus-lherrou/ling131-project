pass along to you free of charge three five to\nSeven three five one for zero zero that's an Americans off his late cardiology three five to seven three five one for the zero zero help yourself\nSo we were talking about the Framingham Heart study we often sort of lean to your specialty cardiology in our discussions here has they affect so much of his type two diabetes discussion today\nAre and we were just talking we're going back to last week about how in the pod cast there's a focus on by agreeing whether or not a it's a it'll affect your your site to take too much of it so here comes\nA ah we focus on direct dial the dysfunction by agra supposedly deals with that so does see how this may be true but there are other natural ways\nOf dealing with it as well how much of it is in your head I would if there's anybody doing this study I'm Wondering how much of a rag doll dysfunction is in your head but this study takes a different approach can write\nWell just to talk about the first question is definitely a rectangle dysfunction has a psychological component and and you have to eliminate that as a possible cause I mean performance anxiety definitely is an issue in any relationship and that is one of\nThe many possible reasons for reptile dysfunction has a number of known so that's the the mental causes and it has a number of known physical causes including hormonal decision sees a nerve an artery damage\nAnd men who struggle in the bedroom they may now be able to also blame their genes this is out of the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences this week various thing for the first time a confirmed genetically linked to erect dysfunction has\nBeen discovered a stretch of DNA has been pinpointed were variations made it more difficult for men to perform as expected\nThe finger up suspicion points to a gene called s I Am one which could be a target for new impotence treatments in the future so that's also exciting so there's a lot of different reasons why you can get a wreck dysfunction there's a lot of treatments\nA complicated area and as we pointed out through ... there are mental issues that can cause it and multiple physical issues and now we learned that there is also genetic issues that can cause\nSo I Wonder if you turn that around the other way I can there be if you have you come from a family where the genetics are positive is that going to if you are um I don't want to say hammers what's the best if you're if you're the\nAffectionate ... if you're able to if you perform well and continually how's that yeah this is that you think that genetic\nWell I think that is both genetic in lifestyle and it seems like the lifestyle that keeps your heart healthy also tends to keep the erectile dysfunction away\nRight if you have good genes so eating a heart healthy diet exercising and blood pressure cholesterol weight\nAnd the blood sugar under control that's going to keep you functioning for a loan extra while\nI think now there are products on the market that are homeopathic there may be just as good as by ... you'd think that's the case a lot of times people don't want to take\nThose drugs but they for whatever the reason think they need something so they rely on some of the things that are supposedly a non prescriptive\nYou know is it a placebo this is where you are talking about the mental hospital\nYeah right it is I think it has frankly are not necessarily speaking from experience\n[laughter] my name's on it\n[laughter] All right All right max ...\nIs a a study on irritable bowel syndrome you know we talk a lot about the the products I have a current advertiser called life changed T the Clintons who's your system\nBut I noticed there's been a lot of stuff in the regular press as well as medical press about all the people who ... irritable bowel syndrome I BS sixteen million Americans\nHave it and most of them it comes comfortably are uncomfortable with diarrhea\nAs well uh what is this this is common with these people what causes it\nAnd how do you are I mean I I really do think there's life change tea or does affected it cleans out and sort of comes everything down is it more common women and men can\nMaybe a little more it's kind of a grab bag of a gastrointestinal\nDisorders that cause abdominal pain bloating mucus in the schools regular bowel habits um alternating diarrhea and ... the patient\nAnd often you know you go in and looking for physical causes and it's hard to find something and you know this is a grab bag of when we really can't pinpoint something specific\nIs at age specific are people that certain ages more likely to get it or not\nUm [noise] it it can affect at any point you know some people think there is emotional factors play a role some dietary editors um some foods could precipitated too much alcohol it it's a complex area and there does in my experience\nChoices but my experience is that you know the the patients don't ask me where I should go they all go where they want to do and we asked them where should we send the prescription it\nRight that's right yeah usually have on file\nAnd a lot of it has to do with their insurance and and they shopped around and the insurers have a relationship with a particular a pharmacy and that's what happens is\nSo that's where it's going to happen big time uh CBS and at the doctor can Krohn hours with

exact causes unknown in fact the diagnosis is made when all the possible diagnosis these\nHave been eliminated and all the diagnostic tests are normal and that's why some people even have doubted that this existed but the medical breakthrough this week is it people with fibromyalgia have widespread inflammation in their brains so no longer will anyone doubt whether fibromyalgia\nActually exist at the new research used in advanced imaging test called positron emission demography or pet\nSo fibromyalgia has been thought of as a as like car pools tunnel syndrome and his sense no it isn't one ...\nIt's been ... grab bag of of of a diagnosis for people who have these diffuse joint muscle weakness a pain syndromes and you just do extensive diagnostic testing and everything comes back to

that they really don't have anything they're they're just mulling or as they say but it's it's wrong ... this is the first time in medical history that some objective finding has been described in

the now famous tapes hours into the great falls a fire recording session\nJerry Lee began arguing with Sam Philips says the songs too simple for him to record but the two talk loudly over each other still pleaded with Louis to believe that his news that could actually be a force for moral good\nThis week in Nineteen sixty five the Ohio State university marching band please hang on movie for the

Seattle\nWhere he meets his Pearl Jam band mates for the first time it starts a week of recording to become the fault of their debut album and\nBetter was chosen based on vocals the added two or three song instrumental demos that the ban may\nAnd if we can twenty twelve breaths a label bosses at him I recall the vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles single mother do after discovering they accidentally press the version that included session musician Andy white playing drums Ringo Starr copies of the disc featuring the wrong version reportedly selling on ...\nYeah and this year there's so much to report on the political front with the local races ... and with the national races on the ballot um and I think the school districts and because of that and because the resources we have haven't got as much attention as maybe they should I mean when you're looking at your tax bill\nAt the large portion of that bill is actually to the the school districts and we haven't looked at that as closely as a result there's all the for city council races there's the the national races there's also the penny swap\nThere and then he counseled raises on the ballot there's just a lot to look at\nAnd I mean pretty much all the major districts in the area either have or past or been working on bonds major bond so hundreds of millions of dollars in ... near a billion dollar bonds probably in total they're probably over a billion dollars now known for any particular district but still they're\nThey're significant and those are going to be impacting for years and years and years to come\nAnd absolutely and you know and the other interesting thing if horses this year that that people are going to be seeing the city races on top of the ballot for the first time in November\nAnd there's always been you know partisan elections in non partisan elections that always been separated when I see a whole list of the ... elections in school actions and things like that of you know I'm sitting on top of the ballot and and and the propositions like should be raised city council salaries\nAnd that that's kind of that sort of an interesting on uh also I just sort of being ... county commissioners court they just did it [laughter]\nYeah that's an interesting differences between county and city government the fact that they can just do it which I I I think it's easy to gripe about but I think that\nWhen you look at ... I've always said that if you look at the the ideal person that you want for a city council position that they think it would be a deal qualifications the ideal you know skill set your or repaying for\nWhat is the pay commiserate with a skill set that's that's demanded solve always wondered if that's part of some of the issues going on with city councils if we're\nSet up to attract the correct people but in any case so many other was a lot of different\nLocal political issues and of course those are going to be you know ongoing and\nIt's nice that they are have combined some of them one of our previous guest Todd career on a previous show which is you want to see in its entirety you can catch her right now on Facebook dot com slash talk El Paso talked about election fatigue in our area that we have so many elections and so many different little things that it can be hard to to keep track of\nPeople may not necessarily know what's going on and they might not even just things like okay you know I Can't even care about this election okay there's a Texas constitutional amendment election coming up that I don't know how it affects me so I'm not going to care about as has happened in in years past so I've\nNever cared about Texas constitutional election [laughter]\nYeah I had that even there\nI mean it did do some significant step in the last one the last ones with the re arrangement of the uh uh believe it was the oil fields taxes that opened up billions of dollars for road development so it can be impacting but I don't think most people understood that even though I don't think I fully understand it I ...\nThe hope is is by putting the local elections together with the national mind has that it could increase a voter turnout which is also a huge issue here in the border of very very low um and I think no matter what your opinion is what side of the aisle you're on we can all agree more people need to get out and vote\nI mean yeah any election that has single digit turnout that's just\nIt's just it's a ... it's embarrassing and it makes you wonder where things went significantly wrong another bit of national reporting on here there was an NPR story a few weeks ago talking to local voters or data ... bakery I Believe in single nobody will area about ... okay do you know what's on the ballot do you know what's going on do you care\nAnd there were still some people that they found that weren't even really aware of of the Senate race of battle running against crews\nAnd and what that meant they just\nDidn't know which ... which what makes you wonder\nWhere has the system failed here I mean with all of the attention I mean is that people disconnected from traditional media is that people not getting explain why they should care about I mean and some people just didn't get an idea like okay what well why should I bother voting which is an entirely almost different issue and a scary one of his own way\n... that seems really strange for news junkies\nRight I mean yeah I think a lot of the times that we're in right now it turns a lot of people into news junkies I'm but I think it's the same time we got to understand that there's a lot of people out there who who who are not and and they were simply and sort of out of the mainstream not paying a lot of attention to these kinds of things they don't see how it really affects their own lives\nAnd ultimately you know in front of the turn out that she has an impact on a lot of things in Austin and it comes to the legislature you're for years and years decades in fact our Paso is significant ... significantly penalized just for\nLow participation in elections both in terms of campaign contributions to candidates and or in terms of the actual vote young nobody nobody saw a need for El Paso\nYou know to to actually come out of here and get our votes because there were so many fields so few of them it didn't matter and did make it didn't make a difference to\nMe I was never particularly of aware of a time when a when Rick Perry relief visited the area at least not in his in his later campaigns may have done one of the first ones but not in in recent memory I Know great give it did make it out at least once in a interesting uh parents had a gun store with Chuck Norris so that was interesting and very\n... to use a different phrase true to form um and then Ted Cruz has been trying to come out here a few times I think he's actually coming out here this weekend now yes he is so that that one's\nHappening I Know I signed up for the tickets there and then when it hasn't been cancelled yet and like the last one did kind of at the last minute so hopefully this one happens because I don't like to see what the responses from our local people towards him directly so that'll be interesting so yeah we're always kind of a\nBy the wayside kind of thing for for state or a particular national politics and that way\nBut that goes back to your point about a Beto O'Rourke ... I mean\nHe's bringing so much attention to this area yeah national platform\nAnd key to his campaign is getting some of these voters out that don't traditionally turnout particularly Hispanics large demographic here no Paso so I Would expect a more folks here in El Paso are energized and it will be interesting to see how many come out to vote in a in a couple of weeks\nI mean yeah if everyone in Paso turned out every registered voter turnout for better that would almost\nNot quite make any kind of uh the the traditional considered Democrat Republican margin in town the question is I mean a ... a day that's not going to happen because all Paso is not going to turn into dedicated informed voters overnight\nThere's just 'cause that's not how it works but\nI mean it could happen I stranger things have happened but I wouldn't I wouldn't hold my breath over it so but\nThat's kind of one structural issue in a part of our politics and I think in a different way that plays a lot of a lot of\nImpact on our politics the fact that it's almost been internalize particularly some of those local races that\nPeople aren't really paying attention that the people who are informed and are engaged are paying attention but that they're those aren't even a majority they're not even a a significant minority because I mean when you get less than ... percent turnout\nYou're going to a certain point you start to expect that well I mean the people who I Know are going to be pissed off are gonna be pissed off about what I'm doing but otherwise the general public yeah they're probably not going to care\nI mean do you ever see that kind of impact on on city council I've I've gotten some of a sense in the past but never anything over in any case\nYeah absolutely that yet [noise] people don't know if any councils doing\nYet and and that's just dollars to make you have to just follow it as we do in the news it seems it seems somewhat compelling at times and great issues going on you got these petitions that are going on and to force things onto the ballot\nUh over over open space and and just ... the kind of like I say almost environmental a rallying that's going right over over over things that we really never seen before walked out rail open all day on this thing and never seen that actually rise up to the to the top you know that we're seeing it now\nUm and and then I have to throw we have to throw one more thing in a row of bringing attention here you throw him within ... lead and uh and and that's er rap nationally it's sort of come up in the in the world a lot because both of those things and through the TV and work has been on every TV show right to get an hour on CNN coming up\nHere so that a lot of getting a lot of attention that I don't think most people around here know what to do with\nHow do we like they would like to like it is a good thing is a bad thing I mean we ... we almost fond over any previous attempts like a I mean the the glory road movie which was an okay movie people were fanatical about that when it came out because of dealt with the local issues um that are I think it was on FX the show the the bridge which was a\nKind of reset Swedish like nor nor region story about the conflict over the bridge that is that one kind of fizzled I guess that wouldn't be getting a priest as much locally but usually any kind of national attention people were like yeah and now\nBringing up the bridge makes a good point I mean I think we're kind of wary of it because so much of the national attention in the past year has been negative like the bridge and it on ... on a\nBorder violence and and those sorts of things but college is a great example of an ambassador for El Paso that's bringing really positive attention to this region\nAnd he's so quick to credit the nine one five ... um and I think he's probably the best thing we've got going in this region for for national attention as well as ... or ... or because he's really sending out at a different message about the region than what has been sort of spread in the end the past\nThat's true and then also there was I mean in terms of ripping the nine month I've also Aaron Jones with the Packers now\nMean throwing up the nine one five and doing things like that there are so we've had a kind of political entertainment sports stuff going on that's been\nI mean yeah we'll never see and then that'll be interesting once it becomes more official because there was that time a couple of years ago now when there were those mailers being sent out those mysterious unknown origin mailers about how city council was wasting money on another water park when we already essentially the undertone was we have a perfectly good one with a wet\nAnd wild waiting while so that was so I went out on went away idea that that that one that that effort kind of ... dissipated but I don't want to talk to the wedding well people to say well you guys sending these mailers and they they have out no knowledge of such but\nIt was a definitely aligned with their interests will say that but so you know dark speaking about water is that going to be a concern for bringing things like water parks here with the lack of again fifty percent of our supply I mean of course that's different water no hopefully no one's drinking too much of that water at a water park because that's\nDifferent issues but it makes you wonder about the sustainability of such a person on\nThat is absolutely been raised as a concern with not just water parks but the growth in the city in general but I think probably the bigger concern when we talk about national attention coming to the region\nHas been a fracking oh you are typically in Texas and when we talk about water or there's been flare ups and sort of the legal battles that I mean it's nothing new fights over water between New Mexico and Texas yeah when I uh I think in in New Mexico they're saying in Texas where\nWe're kind of putting straws underneath the ground and sucking the water out and using it for fracking\nI'm In that that I think is probably the larger environmental concern that people have in regards to water rather than a than water parks and that sort of thing\nSo small that used to do water than say the I mean and the other parts of the country concern also being than the contamination of the existing water for people you know drawing for like well sources and you know the people that need a lighting their false it's on fire because of than the contamination happening into their water supply\nWrites in so much of the water here in Texas is like an underground lake essentially\nSo I Know I've I've been you know in around like the\nKind of the the ...\nI don't know if that's the right technical term but the armpit of Texas who the part where\nThe corner of New Mexico intersects Texas I from the Texas side of town but that's what our minds me anyway I'm you know the Odessa Midland that kind of like Hobbs that kind of region where they have tons and tons of oil wells active ones now a newly renewed wells because of the fracking revolution that has happened\nThere's actually a company just east of El Paso called a torch light energy or that's just starting to do drilling and some fracking 'em out by sort of past Waco tanks not not actually far from us\nPass though he was come as come pretty close to the to the region\nAnd its its encroaching over here definitely I mean people talk about west Texas being a hotbed for drilling activity and people in Paso thing like when we're west Texas where the heck are they and it's it's getting here\nIt's also important to say though that the other side of this when we talk about the growth of the city and and ... and a economic impacts\nWe have benefited greatly with\nA western refining which has now been purchase several times during minor here\nUh Paul Paul foster his investment here in the region right yeah so a lot of the sort of economic boom from that has actually touched touchdown passes through ... foster and through his company here the refinery of ... which is ... uh charged a lot of downtown revitalization the revitalization of historic buildings\nAs well I mean the eyes um get to speak with him briefly at the the rebuilding roasted then a couple of weeks ago talking about his personal investments and buying many buildings I mean there was the the mills complex area there on the the corners honestly do plaza which she bought and then of course the war going on with the plaza hotel\nAnd and those things um and then of course is is look at future projects he's been looking at ... uh he's tried to buy out the the ... properties here a couple\nOf times like a different way yeah brings us to maybe one or the other day stories that should be on the lessons Billy Abraham drama style drama with ... and so pervasive than yeah they'll pervasive an on going and we have in November ... election and uh basically the whole kitten ... like in his downtown\nProperties are likely to be auctioned off um which will of the hope is I think the anticipation is it is going to end up putting some of the a historic downtown buildings that have been sitting there and sort of falling apart or that a lot of people have had their eyes on for a long time are are going to end up in the hands of some people who have a\nA significant resources um and uh and and some plans to basically develop those properties me to have the money on the in the interests and the game such thing as in ... I'm right in that I'll ...\nI'll say won't go away because that now is that we can get out of the possibility of prison time because of how many other that's never going to go away and uh well it may [laughter] let's hope out of that will be interesting to see what happens on that day when all the properties are up for um for auction for an option\nI mean yeah it's been in talking with some like architecture and development firms in town like the the existing\nOtherwise own outside of the Abraham portfolio historic downtown building stock the buildings\nAre have been pretty much bought up and we saw that turnaround from the okay let's flat and that and maybe put up a parking lot we'll see what happens kind of bad attitude finally went by the wayside as people are seemingly realize that hey maybe we can actually like make money if we put investment into this as opposed to just flattening and so hope someone else\nYou don't build it up like we saw happen with uh some of the blocks are most notably probably with the um the mirror building which has been getting read it all up in a certain way but the original plan certainly didn't materialize of a turning into a multi use area there were there are many different plans that\nI mean still haven't happened with that ... that were originally discussed before what it was flat and\nAnd this is this is actually the kinds of things that other cities would probably love to have it and we've had these things that have been sitting in sort of ... and in in in in a preserved state that nobody's been able to touch and now suddenly these great properties are are coming up in the ... of some significant development that will that will\nReally altered the face and the look and feel anything of downtown [noise] um and then you know without having to build new buildings and when you\nLook at these these buildings ... billion ... building I think you could say this is really one of the the last pieces of downtown revitalization I mean you've had\nAll these changes with the ballpark and the revitalize buildings but then you have these eyesore as mixed in and the landmark historic buildings that are gorgeous and have so much potential so election day is going to be a big day not just for the elections but also for the scheduled um auction\nOh yeah the again the the auction I think will be a definitely a red letter day you know pass those development history and uh but even that I don't think we should initially I expect that all will be well and good once things move on because one of the things that I'm I'm\nPaul foster talked about during the rebuilding Troeh says that is interesting the crust building specifically a corners honestly do plaza it's kind of a ... it's a weird sneaking building when you actually look at it from the it's for planet doesn't it's not one it's not a square it's\nIt ranges across parts of that block just south of sentencing do plaza so it's not a normal space or a regular safe little bit like and how it got kind of like an album and it kind of get it circles other building it's it's weird in that way and so forth awestruck by the fact that\nThat's not going to be easy to deal with because there's not demand for it when it was built it was kind of a\nIt was kind of a strip mall in a building basically like there were different shops between and you can scroll through that kind of thing and now there's not that the demand for that kind of property anymore\nWell he said that I I Believe even if he could get that building essentially for free [laughter] yeah I'm Still not be profitable because of how much you have to invest to bring it up to\nUsable condition you ... you include there's all sorts of historic tax credits elbow from the state and the federal government which I think need to be credited in part\nFor the development we're seeing in downtown but then when you factor those in\nIt's still not a great economic proposition unless you have the big picture in mind which is kind of revitalizing the an entire downtown area but that specific project you said probably wouldn't be profitable\nYeah and again you maybe get long term in terms of you know bringing up and bringing people kind of back down to downtown to to live to work which there have been significant gains and strides in both with you know hotels opening an ad apartments now opening but yeah that specific kind of project without significant\nAdded up to I mean basically getting and then re doing would take take some doing\nAt the at the sort of finding out that was well the the other big story there right at this moment you know is is what's happening to the commuter rail slashed pass it on ride to hell with the construction kind of grinding to a halt when we were hearing talk for a long time\nOr about the possibility that that was going to happen and things were slowing down there were problems on the site quality of work\nYou know and um and now the construction has stopped in a\nCity is saying that and and and the company's not really talking much been sitting there saying that you know they'll get a new a prime contractor on that uh possibly as early as next week\nWhich would be a real blessing right for the miners group if they could get this thing back up and running that quickly as opposed to what some thought was going to be in some have said in fact it can be a protracted a period of no activity there and what was to be the\nThe sort of the crown jewel downtown convention right now you know coming online and everybody thought that was going to be just the really coolest thing\nAnd uh but it's a very expensive project and I think that's probably what miners group is finding out\nI mean yeah there was I mean Margaret came in with very wealthy and tensions both with the coming around hotel and then that the the west side tower in its various different incarnations and discussions which has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Doug
