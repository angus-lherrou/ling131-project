C. R. combination formula and remembered the CPR stands for Kirk human inner spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners could get started for free that's great value what when people expect to pay if they bought all these separately in the store\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty yeah so they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend\nNBC News radio I'm John Jeffries key GOP Senator Susan Collins is going to vote yes on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nAnd we're looking at the function of the hard when you put the pedal down and go as high gear and you want to make sure that the hearts functioning well in high gear and while that's when it\nRan in high gear comes you get on the treadmill many you've had a stress test on the treadmill I went I think for fourteen minutes or something up to one and a half times or whatever you're what's the measure I forget now with the numbers are but it's something that's extreme to see what happens in your heart when you're really\nPoor in on the coal in essence right right\nSo and then you jump on the table the ultrasound is there and you stick that around and you're going to see pretty much everything in your heart and so you saw what did you what did\nHear describing what's called an exercise stress echo where we do an ultrasound the heart at rest we're looking at the main pumping function of the heart\nAt risk which yours was normal and then right after ... exercise you had an area of your heart small area that wasn't contracting more vigorously after peak exercise as it should if all the blood is flowing normally\nAnd it turned out that this area that wasn't functioning as it is\nSuperbly as it should at peak exercised immediately phone pick exercise\nWas because of the small vessels these micro vessels we looked at your big vessels they were fine ... the big vessels it's in the small this and we gave you some more small vessels by doing this noninvasive procedure called E. C. P. which proves the blood flow to the heart and we read\nStudy you and you had normal stress tests so we had improve blood flow and now yet normal blood flow and everything was working well\nAnd that seems to have been consistent 'cause I stopped he CPA a couple of years ago and then my test last year and I'll have another one this year it showed that the thing in return that they can groan nationals around the old went into what had happened\nWell the CPA does stimulate new blood vessel development you do that out in California I did\nYes yep yep went to a place in California for four or five years in a row I go over there every week sometimes more than that I think it's a it was a ... treatments\nAre supposed to have well the way the way it's it's usually done customary office will prescribe ah thirty five one hour ... minutes that the initial dose most people will respond about eighty five Ninety percent of people will respond\nWith that do city cp they'll improve in their symptoms and then the stress tests also improve with better blood flow so we have objective measure besides the subject of measure which is just the symptoms\nWhich everybody wants feel better and that is important and then we can objectively approve that the blood is improving slow to your heart by looking at a follow up stress test\nRight and that's where I think I had three series it leads to thirty five one each winter has their one to California go and try to get thirty five in over the course of the winter and then uh I think but it was three it was a course of three of these at least\nAnd you got to do and you got your turbo back\nYeah I Do and sometimes they call and want to know if I Want to go back again I don't know that'd be over ...\nAnd how you feel you're feeling funny well I think right now\nI feel fine All right let's talk about a a bit of research that you did reading and the journal circulation as long as we're in the cardio department yoyo readings\nMay signal what have you of cardio and when we say yoyo readings are we talking about blood pressure are you talking about heart or ... what are you talking about\nAll of the above this isn't as you said circulation was the main clinical generally American Heart association a Bible journal for all cardiologist so if you're white blood pressure cholesterol or blood sugar levels fluctuate Doug you may have a higher risk of heart attack\nStroke and premature death then people would steady readings\nTreatment strategies to reduce fluctuations in these parameters should be a goal to prevent bad health outcomes\nThese strategies might include keeping blood pressure cholesterol and blood sugar within normal range is not too high or too low and maintaining a normal weight not too fat or too thin\nSo do you need drugs they need to eat better natural homeopathic ways of if you have irregular numbers of getting them back to regularity\nWell you know what I always say my favorite drug is exercise you combine that with a good diet it's targeted specifically to you personally fear ideal body weight and if you don't\nKnow how to do that talk to your friendly dietitian so you want to figure out the calories and protein carbohydrates and fast that you should eat to get down to your ideal body weight and deal with whatever other medical issues you have\nAnd get as healthy as possible diet is so important and if you're not eating the right side there's no way you're going to be healthy ... in the long term\nAnd then adding an exercise program wants to the doctor says it's OK and that should include stretching aerobics and strength training\nAnd that is an amazing way to maintain your\nYour health to maintain your weight and just to maintain a great positive outlook it's my favorite way

I don't think so 'cause Canada is really an expert in his field\nAt lake cardiology you get all kinds there's not though once over lightly treatment as you get with other doctors can is very thorough he's got a following not only locally in central Florida but all over the state all over the south east all over the country people come from all over the world\nTo see can in fact and you can have that experience as well if you'd like to book an apartment why not\nThree five to seven three five\nFourteen hundred connects you to lay cardiology and Dr Kenneth his clinic three five to seven three five one for the zero zero I back to the trending stories of the week for the world of medicine smoking\nWeakening the immune system I would've thought that didn't need to be studied that kind of a ... isn't it\nWell it's a new wrinkle on and it's from the dental literature journalism into Don ticks this week the list of health risk Doug linking\nTo smoking just continues to grow the news this week is it aside from lung cancer emphysema and heart disease the problems we know about cigarette smokers they also have a weakened immune system affecting their dental health\nSmoking apparently reduces the ability of pope inside teeth to fight illness and disease\nMhm so this underscores our conversation good doctors know the connection between gum health\nAnd the health of generally in your mouth and what it leads to with the rest of with regard to the rest of your body there's so many connections to the gum that most people don't see and I don't know the doctors to represent that as being as important as it is can do you agree with that\nI think the mouse is the doorway to good health and ah if you don't keep your gums and tease healthy that inflammation will spread throughout the body and cause problems far from the males so\nIt's having a good dental hygienist than a good a dentist is just absolutely necessary for good overall health\nAll right bye egg right in the medical news this week and it isn't good\nWell it's there's a lesson here for all of us this comes out of the medical journal written all cases\nThis month a high doses of the incidents drug commonly known as ... bag reduction cause damage to the eyes retina\nThat results in irreversible eat tinted vision people who depend on colored vision for their livelihood need to realize that could be a long lasting impact of over indulging in this drug\nNormal doses of the drug can cause vision problems but a big but symptoms typically disappear within twenty four hours when you use the normal dose\nSo living by the philosophy that is a little bit is good dug a lot is better can be very dangerous to your health especially if you using via agra and rely on your color vision\nSo by agra is not as important as it used as much now as it used to be do you think it was very it was a there was a craze it ... came out it shows a lot it is about ... or the other thing\nThat that group of drugs but a ... see Alice and yeah that that group of drugs there's other choices and ...\nHad the benefit of being the first guy on the block so that's where I got a lot of publicity\nSo is this an example of drugs that if you don't have a thirty year test run you don't really know I think that's what you're alluding to it\nTo be well actually what I was alluding to is that people on their own taking higher doses thinking that a little is good so a lot to be a lot better and you can get yourself in trouble and this is not bad medicine and this is just patients on their own taking more than they are prescribed\nAnd you can really do yourself in doing this especially if you like your eyes\nYeah All right I got\nSome uh I like my eyes so I'm not trying to like my eyes I Am not trying to scare people\nAway from ... ... I'm just trying to urge you to use the dose that's prescribed by your ...\nOr less so now we have these stories this week of powder is being sent\nTo the Pentagon to the White House or rice and or other things that have been murder was the ten years or so ago anthrax anthrax that was it so what is race and what's the anthrax what's the worry year well people\nThan asking me about this so I thought I Would add to this week uh yeah because of the front page news about it\nSo rice in is a natural but very toxic compounds it's a by product of processing caster beans I don't think you're growing those on your farm or you know good\nIf working it works by this this rice and it works because I knew that asked me how does it work so I I I really delved into it works by getting\nInside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need without the proteins cells die eventually this is harmful to the whole body and it can cause death\nSo rice in breaks down cells killing a person over a period of hours or days if inhaled injected it or ingested less than a pinpoint of rice and can kill a person within thirty six the forty eight hours deep valley or the respiratory lose\nThere's no known antidote for rice in but there is some good news rice in poisoning to is not contagious oh okay [laughter]\nWell ... all the rage uh when they were very worried about anthrax is that something that would help if you had there were you were exposed a rice and good question what is the ... first\nOf all frozen antibiotic good very good question anthrax is a bacteria and this rice and is is more like a protein ... it's not above it it's a it's a natural substance breakdown from caster beans it's like castor bean oil it's approached it's mostly protein ...\nReally pro say that again why\nIs pretty fair yeah I I was his own choice I guess it was his job as a very unusual because he didn't know this is the first time having a child my gosh\nAnd so ah but ah my God he I mean that you know he started out today I don't know I have a doctor may just sent me an email a little while ago and so that is highly running was yeah I Would have thought it would be awful you've had your call then yeah but I went to highlight like yeah I Do\nI'm not surprised they did that oh my God that has to do that all of it just gives me the really

exchange fear the doctor can grown and I was traveling into our ears in our mind every week on good day health and a part of our overall focus on your health and wellbeing there's a lot of that\nAre here and it's appropriate because a lot of people have questions\nAnd as has been set a was having a conversation earlier with a doctor who said as you're talking about irritable bowel syndrome and ah how it seems to be more prevalent and women and then she suggested the reason for being more prevalent and women the women go to their doctor more often\nThan men do or to seek out answers to questions do you find that to be the case in your practice or late cardiology down in Florida and more women come to you with the hard questions\nProblems and well correction than men\nWell in general women a little bit more than men tend to go to the doctor and often a\nReason why some married or a couple of men do better is because a good woman behind them get them to the doctor but I see pretty close I say probably sixty forty women but I you know I ... I see see pretty close\nEven it is I Do you think that's because of your specialty ... cancer that sort of you know I Know you have\nCancer but you know you know getting kind of it's not as easy to recognize cancer symptoms as it is hard to isn't that true\nOr not I don't remember a heart disease is not a ... problem is the number one killer of women in America since the nineties late Nineteen aces has been heart disease heart disease a big problem for women much cancer of the breast or so when we see plenty of women\nYeah All right so speaking of women there is some news this week doctor can is noted for his understanding of the information that is usually just doctors speaking if you were to read some of these journals God Knows why you would [laughter]\nBut if you do to keep you overnight F by God sorry where I can read them and so to synthesize the information so here's something that's important for those of you who are those view the we're looking at a female side of things and the impact of processed meats\nOn women and breast cancer issues\nYeah that's for us prevents them breast cancer this as the international Journal of cancer just this week the eating process meats like bacon sausages and ham can increase the risk of breast cancer regularly consuming processed meats is linked with nine percent higher risk of breast cancer\nProcessed meats are those that have been preserved by smoking curing assaulting\nWow look around at the information I saw a recall of a ground beef\nCargill again one of the egg giants are putting all the small farmers out of business they had a recall tens of thousands of pounds of ground meat because of the cold I we talk about the cola and salmonella listeria all of these things frequently can\nWhat we kind of look at it as something that they can be overcome\nBut is there and your experience or what you're\nReading and some of the journal is is there a long term impact of you know kind of following up when we just said about processed meats I'm eating this stuff getting attacked by these bacteria can it have a long term almost fatal impact on you if\nYou have enough of it or if you don't really get it all out of your system\nWell those who have\nIllness their immune systems are not working up to par in the very young these illnesses can be a life threatening but most of us in middle age who have good immune systems we get sick but we get better\nYeah but this instance here brings about a focus on kidney failure apparently the symptoms the diarrhea and they are to Boston Roman seems to be a part of our conversation in the main today uh the uh the number of people being\nHurt by this uh ... he cola all of these things and just it's amazing the bugs getting stronger and processing of\nFood that makes it more of a of a problem because they they ... they cover it up and set of you know not having it in the first place\nI so there's a food news with Dr ken here's some news speaking of food if you're interested in super health and super wellbeing then you need Texas super food at your side or at least in front of you every day the powdered form\nCapsule form of fifty five organic fruits and vegetables and that's the underscore here\nThe organic fruits and veggies but a lot of products out there with\nFruits and vegetables powdered and there are good but this is the best Texas super food

appears Brett Kavanaugh has enough votes to be confirmed to the Supreme Court to key swing votes fell into Kavanaugh's quarter ...\nGiven to them in any kind of other there's like there's a family tradition and the schools which don't really offered that kind of experience I mean but you get you get basic civics rolled up in social studies but you don't really get that okay here's why you should go to the U.S how you vote why you yeah I figure it out\nRight you know and and during my primary actually spent some time\nFocusing on nearly registered voters and and many of them fell into two camps and and I'll tell you that takes more time\nThan talking to someone who is a frequent voter because the newly registered voter if you've got to convince them that it's important to vote and they might have registered for a couple of reasons because their parents you know Eighteen year olds\nI Can't tell you how many Eighteen year olds I came across a story that I not said well my parents made me register ... so it it wasn't\nGood and I'm like okay but then are you doing\nBut are you going to vote so yeah um but there were new citizens and I will tell you the new citizens that I have to they were fired up um and they they they registered to vote adjust after retaining their citizenship and they are ready to go to the polls but we're targeting\nThat group that you just mentioned that those are the folks on who's door knocking the the people who are registered to vote but for some reason we lost them somewhere along the way they've they've voted Democrat at some point in the past maybe they only vote in presidential elections and nothing else\nAnd we're talking to them because ... and we're telling them look this mid term your vote matters more than ever and what we've seen Andrew across the country is a lot of races are really super close in Virginia for example the Virginia legislature\nThere was a tie and one could have determine the outcome of that election and instead it was determined it through a coin flip\n'em any of the ... race I mean to you know talk about the power of a single voter and so what were you know I've been telling the stories to folks about ... the I Do think that that at the state level\nThat that those races going to be close is the sense that I get you know I Hope here in El Paso we win big that's working on\nBut I think um other Democrats up and down the ticket you know I'm I'm not just working for myself but I'm working to help other Democrats on the ticket has her hum as you know as we reach out to voters that that that these are the folks that are harder to get to\nHarder to convince they have felt abandoned somewhere along the line\nI mean to be perfectly honest the pony representation in El Paso puzzles or\nYour lord we're going to do with all of it's a democratic stronghold on the Democrats will get elected but also we both parties don't have much of a federal footprint like the party structure\nI mean I think most people can tell you the Democratic party leadership is in town outside of the fact of yourself basically and put it on your time as as county judge and then when it comes to the Republicans\nDo they have their efforts but I don't feel like the majority of the community has a real stake in either party they just\nThe people who vote the are the ones who are are making\nThe decisions but that's not even anywhere near a majority of our community\nAnd and I think I think what you've just said has been true for a long time I do believe it's changing for the Democrats under the leadership of Ileana again she has worked so hard to build an an an organization that is very inclusive\nShe's been super open to collaboration in a way that you know I have never felt as a candidate or as a a\nAn elected official and so it's been really exciting to work with her ... campaign is trying to um bring in young people and so a lot of our block walkers for example our young people who have a stake in their future and they realize that more than I think they ever have\n'em so we're very excited about that we really do kind of want to change the dynamic in a positive way we've done that I'm In the ... campaign also for example\nAnd the way that we've been gauge with voters we've chosen and and I think you saw it through the primaries there was a ton of mudslinging and it was really ugly\nOur campaign I chose not to engage that way so you never saw a commercial for me that was attacking an opponent you never saw mailer from me that was attacking an opponent\nI don't even mention my opponents you know I I prefer to talk to voters about what what the issues are that are important to them what are what are what they want to see happen what do they believe will help improve the country what are the values that they think their member of Congress should have\n'em and and I feel like when we focus on those issues when we focus on what voters want to see him with what they want and what their fears and hopes are you do you bring so many more people in um you know we're we see what's happening in DC and so many of us are disgusted by it\nThe you know the end there's going to be division and there's going to be ... nature of politics but it's really ugly\nAs a certain point was supposed to be coming together and working together and not just taking your bowl and going home why it seems to happen more often these days what junior ... speaking about ... what is your first we had a debate this past week um\nMaybe proved to face with the Republican candidate Rick Seeberger and and the beauty of those issues for numbers but how do you feel that when\nI was very happy with um the outcome you know I stayed focused uh you know I can I I'm really only evaluating my own performance and um how I felt about it we you know we believe in an honest debate um we believe in telling the truth we believe in\nAt putting our values very clearly out there um and and and and putting my own thoughts clearly out there so that folks know exactly what they'd be getting should I when I'm you know when it comes time for them to to go to the polls there's no doubt where I stand\nOn positions have er um and so I you know I I mean I Will tell you I was I I get very disappointed when people are not\nTruthful um you know I mean like one of my ... it's like out of the gate you know Mr seeberger says\nWell you know my opponent came from a wealthy family and it honestly like I I wanted to laugh we we came from a lower middle class family I ... and and and I don't even know why that matters you know I I feel like that's\nThat's precisely even if it were true [noise] that's what I think people don't want to they want to hear where we stand on the side I felt very good about being very clear on family separation on immigration a on a economic development on education et cetera I I I felt\nGood you know the outcome of the debate was was helpful or awash or 'cause oh Tony what's up with some people after the debate particular some some you tip students and I'm a\nI wasn't encourage let's put it in any direction because of the ones are maybe I just haven't been cherry pick your the ones who just\nSeem fairly clue is even if it ever being sat through the ... the ... but there were there but\nI also okay who do you think more and more told me kind of like what Rick Seeberger set about jobs looking on the other side I'm not really I guess you have your mind made up not really so just after the whole debate about a ... hour and change\nJust not really haven't got much out of it so it kind of wonder if they were really wants to make so much bigger images of people I talked with or didn't really seem to know about going on that kind of stereotypical undecided voter who maybe we'll flip a coin on election day but\nThose are those are definitely the harder I mean I Will tell you most forums and my experience and this is my fourth election and during the primary we debated for six months so it was it there were I went to a lot of four and a lot of debates the vast majority of folks you'll find in the audience have already made up their mind\nThere with a campaign or or they are uh with the party\nUm or there with the organizers of the event there's generally an at at those um forums a very small very small small small group of people who are undecided\nAnd sometimes the the uh former debate won't help them make up their mind I had\nI did during the primary there were a few uh events where folks told me you know I I was undecided and I I did not like the way that your opponents behaved and\nAnd um I just don't know enough about them and so you know I've you've you've been in the headlines and doing stuff for a dozen years and so that's why I'm going to end up going with you and everybody has a different reason [noise]\nUm but young people I think in particular unless they're really paying close attention it's it's if their brand new voters and they're kind of discovering everything for the first time\nSo yeah that's that's always the challenge how to get those people desiring to be involved but [noise]\nSo we're going to be some of the the biggest issues that really give up we're I think ... is one where there was the do the strictest divide 'em we have Rick Seeberger on the show previously and what we empower interview right now over on the taco Paso page on Facebook but\nBasically use is to his damn boy gonna boils down to ... great but we need jobs we need the the jobs of the tree is going to to be here are usually sufficiently unimpressed with the idea of you know stuff moving through our area brings jobs will stop being rude and being transported to or area I'm brutally\nI Want to do everything possible to position El Paso or\nTo be in line for for leadership and so in terms of a leadership position in the future we know that looking\nLike a like plates on like German\nYeah debates on certain committees um you know a leadership in terms of issues um you know the the best way to make sure that I'll pass so gets resources back home or the way that al Paso gets um\n[noise] you know the way that we can positioned ourselves and an advantageous way is to build those relationships and collaborate with people feeds me and to make sure that\nThose relationships are strong enough where the the people currently in power recognize what El Paso has to offer and so for example\nHe's me you know I for me it's super important that Fort Bliss and be a\n... as it is for the entire community that Fort Bliss or a a a a priority for the ... the Congress and for the Senate and so the best way for me to do that is to build relationships with people on armed services for me to build relationships with people and appropriations\nAnd to make sure that they know who I Am that they know what our needs are and that I collaborate with them wherever I can um and so when a you know we work we're working with leader Pelosi we've worked with um minority whip Steny Hoyer he's been here as well\nWe've introduced them to key players in the community I've kept in contact with her team um you know my my campaign staff has kept in contact with their team if we win in November and if we flip the house\nThat's going to be a very important relationship protests that have and if I'm a member of Congress I I Would like to be on significant committees and said that and not for me but for the community\nFor but I could have a ... because I mean Fort Bliss as one of the more immediate examples of how the federal government affects us direct site here as opposed to other programs are grants I mean federal dollars immediately go straight to being spent in this community fights I guess as there have been any particular\nPreparing a relationship because for the background here that are better though\nWas not just out a message out the reelection of the of unanswered blows the as AS Party leadership saying that he was disappointed basically is as violent of a message as you can really get within that kind of political sphere to be perfectly honest\nBut has led to some questions about whether or not so has missed out on certain opportunities like a notably because no range or efforts that were going on right at the end of the Obama administration's that\nThen kind of just went by the wayside and there's questions on if that was a part of it but I think a reasonable person can draw conclusions on so is this something that you particularly had to focus on or has this been something where the national party has really wanted to change that themselves as well\nYou know I think the ... and I'll and I'll tell you every time I've heard a Nancy Pelosi speak at events or at fundraisers anywhere in the public sphere she has been so complimentary if that though\nAnd she wants him to win the everyone in the Democratic party wants them to win and everybody or whether it's the national party or the loom hearty um recognizes that his victory would be monumental\nImportant and it's achievable and so everybody's rooting for him so I don't I don't know I I went in there so I don't know what I mean aside from the public statements that he ...\nI don't know what the relationship was like but I can tell you from the moment that I announced um I've gotten nothing but love and support and uplifting from\nAh people here and people in Washington DC and I think part of that is that that I've had a record I've had a very long record that people can look to\nFor what I have worked on for the things that I have stood up for for the times that I've used my voice on behalf of the community and so I you know there's kind of no mystery to as to who I Am or what I stand for\nAnd there's no question between you and the leadership of of what of what you really doing I guess have you felt the need to do any repairing relations or is that does not only factored into it\nAt all I think you know I think if there was any if there were any issues or if there was any friction um they it none of that has been transferred to me I don't know that there has been so I'm not saying that there has been but if there were any if I have not felt any repercussions it's been nothing but support\nI mean there has been interesting investment in our area I think there to confirm and Mexico side but there have even been a D triple C ads been running in our area which is something you don't usually hear in Texas which is why I'm pretty sure it's from Minnesota\nTo yeah to it it's the it's the race between such he thought as small on the Democratic side and I cannot for the life of me remember her Republican opponent ... New Mexico to starts at Les ... says and goes all the way up to just south of Albuquerque\nHuge huge a geographic area my last ... says is one of the the bigger markets for them and said that's why we're seeing that\nThere are definitely so it's an interesting there has been investment from the national board that you can directly see I'm even though it's also usually expect around this area right not a part of it so\nOne of another one of the factors here we're talking about the the level enthusiasm and kind of almost not quite big meal puzzle for granted as democratic city I mean you still need people to show up enough of sometimes said that if you got a thousand committed voters in any race you could even have like the Libertarian Party take over here so nice to meet people to to show up so\nWith the particularly with the events going on in the past few weeks we've had the nomination Amir confirmation Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court\nThat has been seeing nationally a lot of enthusiasm on the part of a conservative voters Republicans as well is that something that is being factored into your campaign at this point or is that something that we're still going to watch and wait and see what happens in our community specifically\nSo here's the the the thing for al Paso is that um there just aren't the same number of Republicans as there are Democrats\nAnd I do think my guess is is that El Paso Republicans I'm probably are reflective of you know some of the national trends I I haven't seen any local polling that that is specific to the Republican Party and I'll\nTell you don't have that much lower motor yeah\nYeah I'm ... but my guess would be that that they were probably fired up by the Kavanaugh hearings by the same token in in El Paso the Democrats have been very fired up by the Kavanaugh hearings as well\nUm you know by the the feeling that that there is a lot at risk when it comes to voting rights when it comes to dark money when it comes to reproductive rights and and after the hearing last week judicial temperament and and incredible partisan biased\nUm and so I think that the folks that I've spoken to on my side of the aisle are very fired up as a result of this and realize and and see this as the selection as a ... a need to create a majority that will be a check and balance a\nCheck and balance so again we're kind of going back to that that blue wave idea which this would be a part if not the the real switchboard because again I'll pass so again anecdotally democratic stronghold even if it's not so much a stronghold as the people who do show up are the ones who\nWrite numbers that and again not necessarily just for us but we need those numbers for the ...\nCampaign organization and I just wanted to see what however many people were voting showing up in the polls group for the rest of the Texas that we matter because right so so many times they'll Paso gets discounted in so many ways it's encouraging to hear that you guys are doing so cussing on a new voters and pivoting to that but [noise]\nI guess really in in all of this is there an expectation that we're really going to hit\nThey use these uh these output goals I mean it's this is a midterm election so it's not a presidential election which is which is an easy vote getter regular not one of the off years but we also have so many elections it'll pass so we have election going on basically every year and even multiple times a year that\nI think people get confused about what's what's exactly going on when\nWell and you know what I have to tell you Andrew here's what's going to be interesting about this November ... they're going to be so many things on the ballot this November all those municipal races are now being shifted to November because there's no municipal race in my district which is district too in central Paso\nI don't know what's happening with any of those other races for city council there's I think there's four seats up maybe a\n... year I've lost track because of course with ... and yeah there are candidates that sounds about\nRight so there's there's a district one and district date and I think district five five and six six six so you know or or six and seven one of those um ... no ... well\n... there for the city council seat that\nWhichever of the way the information in front of all this county votes dot com yeah is where all of this you can find sample Belgium will have a way posted over there are Facebook to accomplish Taco Bell so we're coming to school\nAnd you also have an a a cherry election for ... um we have all of the party races all the way from you know US Senate governor us sent lieutenant governor Senate a Congress all the judicial right yeah it's a packed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "city": "El Paso", "day": "06"}
