of issues going on an area I mean we've been in the national news more in the past couple of years then we have more in the past couple of decades I Want to say so there's been a lot of\nNational enemy even international media crawling around our area than more than we're more used to paying a lot more attention to us and that's kind of an issue in of itself though the way El Paso is getting portrayed but\nWhat do you think are the big three issues that are going on an airplane we with all the stuff going on around one thing good overarching are the three biggest topics going on that are really affecting us and that you know people who live here\nBut maybe you know coming from whatever angles from either in nationally and internationally regionally that are really the most impacting in our area at the moment\nWell certainly hard to narrow it down it's kind of like asking me to pick my favorite children or something like that [laughter] um but I actually have a list I'd have to say that any less has to include the upcoming a local elections um\nThere's a whole lot on the alleys Persian and they want to save if city council position they figure that the deal qualifications the ideal you know skill set yell or repaying for\nWhat is the pay commiserate with a skill set that's that's demanded solve always wondered if that's part of some of the issues going on with city councils if we're set up to attract\nThe correct people but\nIn any case so I mean yeah there was a lot of different\nLocal political issues and of course when I was going to be an ongoing and it's nice that they all have combined some of them one of our previous guest hardcore at a previous show which is you want to see in its entirety you can catch her right now on Facebook dot com slash talk

what was the ... euro Paso bona fetus hear you guys were raised in El Paso ripe\nFor gay rights born and raised so and then\nBrought a obviously a few people who are from the movie takes place in in Colorado so you went away for for a bit there but where did you go to high school in Nineteen Seventy one graduate last in high school but to some graduate Austin high school and actually my father was a sixty nine graduate of Boston high school as well there's only one\nWe all high school in El Paso [laughter]\nOpen up any rivalries or anything but there it is not yeah we both graduated from ... in high school well can Seventy one both in Seventy one and so you guys gonna knew each other back then too right yeah I Do ... chapter of each other but not like a fast friends or anything like that okay\nSo uh and I understand there was also some extra curricular she took part in at your time at us in high school\nIt was one one in particular what was that one [noise]\nI was a cheerleader like or I mean for the athletic purposes I'm sure\nYeah [laughter] it was a dare I was the only varsity cheerleader and they'll pass over the years\nSeventy one and I tried out for cheerleader or which was a vote by the student body I Try it out on a dare by a\nFriend of mine when they announced a truly tryouts\nCasually mentioned you know how to do that if you're not going to do that stellar shut up and watch me [laughter] and I even got voted in\nWhile All right so with all that and so then how did you end up in Colorado from El Paso or\nEarly summer of Seventy to my mother went to visit her sister in Colorado Springs military family oh God for two weeks he came back that she had now we're moving to Colorado Springs and um\nI left in July to uh put an application into the police department my mother left in August and we have a well we left uh\nLeft in Seventy two and I was gone forty four years from El Paso\nWow so just a [noise] visit turning into a long term thing kind of thing yes All right so\nBut\nWhen you first started there in in Colorado Springs you put in that application it was actually a to support different purpose right\nWell I applied to the department in a\nPolice cadet program it was a\nProgram for high school graduates between the ages of Seventeen and Nineteen who won that could be I'm a police officers um he took the same tests as a police applicants did you had to pass with the same score um and if you are hired you were hired at a\nFive dollars and twenty five cents an hour back when the job or when minimum wage was a dollar sixty\nAnd you know you are brown uniform you're not a bad sick or dead on it and um you basically did civilian support jobs in the department are such as me I was in the identification and record bureau or for a period of time um and I also was a a\nRope parking tickets for a period of time and you went through the police academy and on your graduation which was you're twenty first birthday a you converted over to a blue uniform and are starting to feel training program wow\nAnd [laughter] but you started that because we wanted to be a PE teacher right I joined the police department because I wanted to earn enough money to put myself through college and be a high school ... teacher yes\nSomething about a man plans got last or something like that right [laughter] because at a sense of humor\nBecause there is definitely a few twists and turns that that you took in your life that were kind of unexpected at the start right\nYeah yeah so\nFor people who aren't familiar with the book or can't really divine from the title you clearly had a very interesting experience with the Ku Klux Klan or the organization as they they seem to like to call themselves and that also kind of happened on chance how did that start\nA newspaper ad in the uh one of the papers\nUm skating at one day I saw this ad says Ku Klux Klan for information and then there was a PO box so I wrote a note to the PO box a unifying myself as a white supremacist a racist and a\nSign that I use the language of hate that they talk and I signed my real name which was a mistake but it turned out for the better sign my real name and ah gave a wrote the undercover phone line or down there was an traceable that time and mailed it all forgot about it\nAnd so this was this was a few years now and to your police career and you were uh you're you're kind of a vested yourself of the the the teacher as ambitions that this one I assume yeah after being on the job for a year I was having too much fun and he was making twice as much money as a college graduate and the teaching profession\nSo I I ... I banned in that I [laughter] fair enough\nSo what so you you make it ... you you say a couple of times it's both in the book and the movie that you using your real name me to you know a significant difference of this how ... how what would have been different had you not use your real name what do you think the difference would have been\nWell the very fact that Ron stalwarts was one of their class and ... and ... was investigating and simultaneously a\nMeeting with these people talking to them\nSo I Would have been slightly different because uh I wouldn't have a membership card today this is Ron stalwart I wouldn't have a certificate in membership signed by David do ... and that's one of these uh unique things about this ... is a\nThey were totally hoodwinked by rock star wars too\nYeah definitely because I it's definitely a unique situation 'cause I\nI mean it's that somewhat less more like a river I mean it was yeah it looks more like a river that voting had\nOr less than three percent capacity which is I mean when you hear that way it's kind of terrifying to think about it that way 'cause it means what the heck hasn't been happening there needs to win it's not been you know the rainfall or the the other good the other important things the snowpack and those kinds of things not not turning out as I said it was I just waited\nOriginally fifty percent of our water and and uh on an annual basis and so that's that's one of those you know do we really worry about water about yeah we\nProbably should yeah we've got one we should I mean I Know growing up here again that there was kind of a sense that [noise]\nThat people weren't concerned about it because we have our own special awkward first separate from the other you know parts of Texas there may drop refer we have the you know the the ... and in our area and so that's\nSomething that was always say oh we have plenty of water forever but that's it's not as simple as just picking up by the river and that takes more technology which is why you know things like the ... center are great examples of what can be done but also the investment that's required in order to make those sources viable ...\nYeah the desalination plant is another thing that people who visit al Paso often go to see ... um and I think the water utility has been a working particularly hard to ensure our future with with water I'm particularly buying a water branches and such out in out in Del Rio\n... lots of water basically made them and they should have access to a lot of water and a and I think next year or so\nUm you know the new um [noise] a\nRecycled water plant is going to come on and that's that's gonna be a eh eh something for a pass them to sort of get used to the whole I recycled water recycled water totally recycled water the water that he's in your sink and your toilet today\nI'm ... ... it's going to be coming out of your tap and you know two days later and\nI Know that sounds that can sound significantly scary to a lot of people but I don't know somehow I got the impression growing up that that was already being done I don't know if that was I just miss misheard why don't you know going through school that these were the future plans I took it to heart is okay that's what's happening and I just really hope that there are sanitizing it well enough\nBut my understanding it's a little higher tech than what we saw in the ... the old movie water world [laughter]\n... than that\nIt takes it takes a a bit more of a process and that and that's why I mean\nThey've they've been making improvements 'em to that that whole system there used to be the the plant over by um I tend an executive the the wastewater treatment plant that it had some certain stench to it\nA certain point seven works near the area and uh now that there's development happening over there it seems to have dissipated a bit they have to do some enclosures of things that weren't previously and close basically so there have been improvements going on to that area whether they're just a cosmetic or what's the term for cosmetic but for the nose\nBut those kinds of improvements kind of thing going on for\nNotice that but you're you're right yeah back then you said at the smelly areas and all of that now that you've got\nThat then and now they've got like you know month a CEO and again ... Gulf going on over there they've they've managed to address that in a way that was never I guess that important before cosmetic for the nose as medicine those I don't I don't I don't know like a perfume I don't know what that phrase would be so we've got\n[laughter] you know you mentioned topped off the menu up golf and and the other interesting thing nowadays is just it's just that the tobacco companies you know entertainment companies and sort of a high profile companies that are coming here or that we're seeing every sort of\nHolding their breath waiting for um uh what is the name of the ah yeah great well fly ... to to land the question of the ... right I Am asking to be coming in and and and that's really and is starting to exciting thing for al Paso\nAnd that's the the water park right that is attached to my hotel hotel water for entertainment experience was like it's a comprehensive thing ride the point is you go there you stay there and then when when it's over you leave and it's it's ...\nI ever been to one but I think that's what it is a nothing official yet but we need we keep hearing almost officially that it's coming and latest we heard it's probably northeast El Paso but we're not sure\nI mean yeah we'll never see and then\nThat'll be interesting once that becomes more official because there was that time a a couple of years ago now when there were those mailers being sent out those mysterious unknown origin mailers about\nHow city council was wasting money on another water park when we already essentially the undertone was we have a perfectly good one with a wet and wild wild so that was so I went out on went away idea that that that one that that effort kind of ... dissipated but no one talked to the wedding well people to say well you guys sending these mailers and they they about no knowledge of such but\nIt was a definitely aligned with their interests will say that but so you know dark speaking about water is that going to be a concern for bringing things like water parks here with the lack of again fifty percent of our supply I mean of course that's different water no hopefully no one's drinking too much of\nThat water at a water park because that's\nDifferent issues but it makes you wonder about the sustainability of such efforts in the long run\nThat is absolutely been raised as a concerned with not just water parks but the growth in the city in general but I think probably the bigger concern when we talk about national attention coming to the region\nHas been a fracking oh you are typically in Texas and when we talk about water or there's been flare ups and sort of the legal battles that I mean it's nothing new fights over water between New Mexico intact [laughter] yeah I when I uh I think in in New Mexico they're saying in Texas where\nWe're kind of putting straws underneath the ground and sucking the water out and using it for fracking\nA and that that I think is probably the larger environmental concern that people have in regards to water rather than a than water parks that sort of thing\nSo small that used to do water than say the I mean and the other parts of the country concern also being than the contamination of the existing water for people you know drawing for like well sources me all the people that need a lightning they're false it's on fire because of than the contamination happening into their water supply\nWrites in so much of the water here in Texas is like an underground lake essentially\nSo I Know I've I've been you know in around like the\nKind of the the\nL office the right technical term but the armpit of Texas through the part where the corner of New Mexico intersects Texas I from the Texas ... but that's what it reminds me of anyway um you know the Odessa Midland that kind of like Hobbs that kind of region where they have tons and tons of oil wells active ones now a newly ...\nNew wells because of the fracking revolution that has happened\nThere there's actually a company just east of El Paso called a torch light energy or they're just starting to do drilling and fracking 'em out by sort of past Waco tanks not not actually far from El Paso who's come it's come pretty close to the to the region\nIt's it's it's encroaching over here definitely I mean people talk about west Texas being a hotbed for drilling activity and people don't pass opening like when we're west Texas where the heck are they and it's it's getting here\nIt's also important to say though that the other side of this when we talk about the growth of the city and environment and economic impacts\nWe have benefited greatly with\nA western refining which has now been purchased several times during minor here uh Paul Paul foster his investment here in the region right yeah so a lot of the sort of economic boom from that has actually touched touchdown passes through ... foster and through his company here the refinery of ...\nWhich is a charged a lot of downtown revitalization the revitalization of historic buildings as well\nI mean ... I'm good to speak with him briefly at the the rebuilding roasted then a couple of weeks ago talking about his personal investments and buying many buildings I mean there was the the mills complex area there on the corner of San Diego plaza which she bought and then of course the war going on with the plaza hotel\nAnd and those things um and then of course his is look at future projects he's been looking at a he's tried to buy out the the ... properties here a couple of times like a different way\nYeah brings us to maybe one or the other stories that should be on the lessons Billy Abraham drama style drama with ... and so pervasive than yeah they'll pervasive\nAn on going and we have in November ... election and uh basically the whole kitten ... like in his downtown properties are likely to be auctioned off um which will of the hope is I think the anticipation is it is going to end up\nPutting somebody a historic downtown buildings that have been sitting there and sort of falling apart or that a lot of people have had their eyes on for a long time are are going to end up in the hands of some people who have a\nA significant resources um and uh and and some plans to basically develop those properties me to have them on the other thing one thing in the interests and then at the end such thing as in that I'm right in that I'll ...\nI'll say won't go away because that now he's doing is the possibility of prison time because all the other that's never going to go away and uh well it may\nWell let's hope out of that will be interesting to see what happens on that day when all those properties are up for um for our sins for an option\nI mean yeah it's been in talking with some like architecture unlike development firms in town like the the existing\nOtherwise own outside of the Abraham portfolio historic downtown building stock the buildings\nAre have been pretty much bought up and we saw that turnaround from the okay let's flatten it and maybe put up a parking lot we'll see what happens kind of bad attitude finally went by the wayside as people are seemingly realize that hey maybe we can actually like make money if we put investment into this as opposed to just flattening it and so hope someone else\nYou don't build it up like we saw happen with uh some of the blocks are most notably probably with the um the mirror building\nWhich has been getting results in a certain way but the original plan certainly didn't materialize of a turning into a multi use area there were there are many different plans that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Doug Stephan's Good Day", "city": "El Paso", "day": "27"}
