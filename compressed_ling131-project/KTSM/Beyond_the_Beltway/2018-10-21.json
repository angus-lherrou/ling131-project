here\nUm I don't really think that the message that's out there is the message that there should be up there should be legal immigration and a path to citizenship for those who are here now a that's somehow gotten lost in all the noise so yes if it's noise that berries the real issues I Am not happy to see that\nWriting is also joined just uh the president at age ... has used in other disruptions he has been using the word mob as it relates to the way that the the Democrats and some progressive uh and some even anarchists responded to the politics of the last month including Brett Kavanaugh\nWhen people see thousands of people marching towards our border even though they're marching towards Mexico right now does that commandeer the word mom and make it political dynamite for the Republicans to use it\nI'm going to say first thanks for having me on Bruce and uh in response to the question about the mob it depends on the listener more than in the uh the broadcaster sort of Mr Trump wants to label them as a mom for some people who are going to accept that label and embrace it and repeated and there are others who are going to reject it\nIf he ... but he if he said nuts\n... ... if he said nothing the video that we just showed don't most people looking at that\nView that as a mob of people they they may be coming to save their lives improve you know their their lives and their children I understand that I Would accept that threat but isn't meant viewed as a mob especially carrying the flag of another country trying to get into our country\n... ... it can be yes I think though that President Trump did one important step and he said to the leadership in Mexico and Guatemala and Honduras oh by the way these folks that are heading our way\nYou need to stop him or eight dollars stop yeah so here's an act here's a consequence and not to discrete and not to gentle but very clear and that's probably proud of the Mexican government into action\nAnd from what I understand the Guatemalan government also took steps to engage with these folks and have them turned back or\nLet's not forget though that as it is let's not forget that the word mob casinos violence and intimidation which has not occurred in this case so there are plenty of ways to criticize this group but\nThe word mob is typically inflammatory term which this just this president is very good at doing\n... ... what do you think the average person agrees with your definition of ...\nI think so absolutely yes or does that does that mean that the demonstrators on the ... in the south of the civil rights all the marches were were they a mob they were no less there were no more violent or intimidating than these people are so isn't it mob\nIs it proper than in your view for

question to you is a a the picture that we've seen a we've seen a group the mob the caravan breaking down fences trying to get into Mexico\nDoes a mob breakdown fences or does a caravan or do or group of people breakdown fences who breaks down fence\nWhile I earlier said that to characterize it as a mob there has to be violence or intimidation which has not occurred in this case I didn't see that footage stipulating that what you said is accurate than I can see how some people not I would accept the term Bob that's called destruction of property that's illegal in most countries that I Know of\nAt this particular moment it looks like\nBy the way the civil rights marchers didn't do\nAny it looks like at the moment that Mexico is doing what we've asked them to do by stopping people coming into their country so we've heard people on this show for the last five years to talk about the difference between the white Mexico treats people trying to sneak into their country and by the way if they're seeking asylum\nThey should seek asylum in Mexico if they're ... they're called them all at from different one door as Mexico is where they should seek asylum so the question should be asked why isn't in Mexico she giving them asylum\nWhy do they have to walk another Seventeen the people that are on that bridge according to the ABC reporter who was there today they have to walk another Seventeen hundred miles to get to the U.S border so what's happening to them in Mexico\nMexico is not America I mean that there's people worldwide that want to come to the United states of America how many of them to cherish are valued billions billions\n... and and and when do we say enough is enough what's the magic number illegal\nI don't know but I Do know that that we've always been a country of immigrants and that somewhere along the line we have to balance our values with our interest if if the country quote unquote is full right then so be it we have to follow the law whatever the law as well as you said earlier pass a law\nBut again the the the point is now is that too many people are trying to come to the country not through the asylum process yes\nThese these people allegedly are asylum seekers are letting them can't so why we can we can call them refugee yet but the point is the ... the first time they put their foot in the Mexico Mexico should be the country\nThat they either give some asylum or not\nOr they turn their back on my boat let them walk Seventeen hundred miles and we have this chaos and I can you certainly chaos yeah we have this chaos on our borders we and and do we as a country want that do we want to accept that\nWe want to accept the people who are trying to get into your legally or\nIllegally or through asylum what do we want\nI'll take I'll take legally I'll I'll take expanded legal immigration as well um you know that that like I said I'm I'm more pro immigration the most\nYou know of my fellow conservative compatriots and just on Facebook the other day I I put up it's like ... people are ... you know their way too afraid of conservatives especially way too afraid of Mexicans Muslims and not afraid enough of the teachers and professors they're sending their kids\nYou know into debt over in in public schools and universities\nWho are teaching you're literally teaching their kids you know negative things about the United states of America in America's public schools that's much scarier to me than hardworking Mexicans who want to come here and have a better life but that doesn't mean you can let everybody and we can't just open the gate to a billion people now they now or no I didn't say you did but that you did say billions want to come here do you do\nWell the ... the president is saying that the the Democrats' favor or open more\nThat's not true the Democrats don't favor open borders ended for Donald Trump telling a people what the Democrats really actually stand for is like Willie Sutton telling you how to guard your money it's it's it's ridiculous for younger listeners might not know Willie Sutton was a bank robber but uh I I just\nDo some Democrats are for open borders and some of them are vocal enough and on the party leadership or if they're not actual candidate or if they're not open borders I mean I I I was reading some some Republicans are right\nIn racist I don't think all are but there are a few I mean you're going to have somebody with an extreme point of view and and either party I mean what is the Democratic ... you know ... you and I would agree that I one of these down at the end of the day the Democratic party favors expanded legal immigration and a reasonable path to citizenship\nWithout an incompetent unqualified president throwing in nonsense are throwing the kitchen sink into a potential deal that's what I I don't know what I\nWrite I'm just having fun listening [laughter]\nI I think it's going to die in Austin, Texas listening to assign K LBJ go ahead\nI'm I just wanted to are you there yes we are okay but I just wanted to say that I play 'em or\nEndorsed using federal troops National Guard troops\nYou need to make sure that everybody who's trying to illegally cross is intercepted and process according to the law\nOr because if you can't just say well it's too difficult or the optics are bad or anything else so we're going to ignore the law I mean we have the law is there for a reason and it needs to be a force\nBut when you but when you say process to see that that that sort of a loaded word as well because when we had our immigration attorneys here over the last several months I mean to process someone who's coming here\nLegally takes a lot of time somebody coming here illegally it takes a lot of time someone seeking just asylum\nIf it it could take years ... years so I mean this is and by the way this is a system set up by us lawmakers it's a process set up by us lawmakers\nThat can give people seeking to who who who come to this country who get here literally they could spend years are going through the judicial process of immigration trying to get their papers and there's people who spent years doing it I happen to know several people who have gone through the legal process\nIt took seven years\nTo get their papers Seventeen years is right they were coming from Mexico they were coming from the middle east but Seventeen years that's doing it the right way\nSo on and so what you're saying is it's hard but that's not an excuse to night I was off\nAnd see if I may I'm I'm\nThe the cameraman who used to patrol east west German border and I'm going to circle back and say the the proposition of putting federal troops armed federal troops Connor southern border to stop illegal immigration is one that is fraught with a lot of risk\nBecause well trained well disciplined will lead troops who are under arms are carrying weapons with a musician and they're told and I think your phrase was you know uh that they need to be stopped in in dealt with according to the law\nAt and we talk about this as ... as as Americans we say okay if if it illegal immigrants from Mexico or or or any country comes to the United states lower rungs of the American worker is probably going to be hurt because uh they're going to be out priced and they will work cheaper than\nUn American and and they will take our jobs I Can't imagine you know that that's not such an odd thing to understand but I'm thinking is if I'm a low wage earner in Mexico fighting for my family\nTo have a better life maybe even thinking about making a run towards the border or or coming to the United states because I Want a better life\nIf they see thousands of people coming from one Doris in Guatemala into Mexico\nI Would think they would be worried that ... or ... would work for less money than they do in Mexico and there would be a basic resentment that these words or caravan of people could take their jobs ... does that does anyone else\nShe any possibility of that\nWell yes and no I mean clearly that it might operate that way that I think ... mentioned in one of the reasons people want to come here is because we're so rich\nAnd we're ... and we're and feel free it's free you know and so because we're rich and because we're free there's more opportunity here and there is opportunity here for for unbelievable things to happen with the low skilled workers or the number of Mexicans who I run across who are just starting their own businesses and\nAnd you know getting in there and doing things are quite frankly I think it's I I think it's somewhat impressive\nBut you have less of a ... there's this huge us most is between very poor and very rich that you're going to get that you're probably not going to get as much of that between Honduras and Mexico so why don't we talking about the issue because Mexico can't even support\nIts own citizens right now right from one of the ... and that's really that there are the problem is exactly what every single person at the table and some of our callers have been looting too and that is the class issue I mean there's people that are basically fleeing first and foremost\nBecause of hardships\nRelated to the fact that they cannot eat out a living they cannot survive they cannot live and as Bill O'Reilly used to say if I Lived in Latin America would come up here to I Want to call her friend no father wants to see his children's starring but these are people in desperate situations you couldn't pay me enough to live anywhere to go anywhere and by the way that they\nDo they're they're just ... agree with that this is something where I disagree with the president and I think he tends to make the case as he did in in Montana the other night that the people that are coming here you know there are the the drug dealers there are people that the other countries don't want\nI think that's a very small percentage I think the president with his rhetoric a watch to perpetuate a perception that uh the mass number of people that are coming are somehow a less than human I disagree with that\nI Do think there's a portion of\nThat or ... or rapists or a drug dealers or or moles or or mules rather I mean I think all of those things are true but the vast majority I Believe our people coming here because they want a better life for their ... and\nI'm Still trying to find out where all these illegal immigrants are committing all these crimes I've heard of a handful\nOf the we have a bigger issue with of American citizens committing street crime than we do with these these illegal immigrants shouldn't be any my ... I I don't just in the end he went on his degree Bruce but come on I mean they have the numbers are small but for for Donald Trump to save their rapist or the robbers or this or that in in in\nIt's nonsense it's yet at the numbers don't sit there insignia only take one more directly yet Ryan and rose Illinois listening on the Internet [noise] Brian we've only got thirty seconds what's your comment I we talk about it", "show_name": "Beyond the Beltway", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "21"}
