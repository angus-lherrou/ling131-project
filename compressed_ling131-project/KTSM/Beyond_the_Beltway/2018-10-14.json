inspection by a qualified person that can look for those things but you're it does it come with a warning dog or\nYes after they're finished and and that's probably is it a Ninety day inspection and a one year inspection\nYeah I I Believe that it at least one year\nYeah well outside of looking at your architectural drawings and going through it and then looking for missteps or whatever um that's one thing's certain you want to do um but in terms of\nUm you know doing the walk through the probably the biggest thing is knowing that they're going to stand behind at home and just checking stuff in keeping the list I mean I'm I'm On the board of habitat for humanity but a lot of houses\nAnd we train our whole motors um to really keep that list and eat the day the inspection to get some\nBlue painters tape in in you know put the tape where the problem is because they're gonna be problems I mean you're going to him now pops and things like that a full day you know outside of that\nUm\nYou know qualified home inspector looking over the whole project that's not a bad idea um or and then secondary would be you just kind of walking through everything\nAnd seeing you know I don't really have a checklist\nOkay so maybe maybe that you did have some kind of English\nUnderwear and get a qualified inspector right you're kind of a rural area\nRight right that I see that I see [noise] um so do you have the architectural drawings of that\nI I yes I Am and the plan I think they gave me with the\nUh one of the things you can do is just check that the things that you agreed to have in that house are there\nOkay so you know the switches or where they are the floors that type of quality it is I'm not going to say that you're really gonna find any real imperfections I mean you you can take this as far as you want you can get a thermal imaging camera and make sure the inflation is all the way\nFrom top to bottom on the walls you can make sure the installations is that 'cause they said in the ceiling\nUm those type of things\nBut I guess my main concern is making sure that everything is tied together from England these two sections were were\nOkay you lost me there [laughter]\nWell they came and it came into sections here and they had to put together uh-huh\nAnd and so I just wanted to make sure that everything is is satisfactory where she joined sure\nYeah [noise] gee I don't even know if I could to inspect that I'd I'd I wouldn't even know what to look at OK modular one day I I don't know and I'm Sorry\nOkay All right Doug thank thank you and by by All right and I'm Michael you've got some uh some water soft their tips\nBeing in the industry okay add one thing I Know that there are some generic soccer is out there that you can get from a have a ... you have a reputable farmer and they usually get\nFrom a company called black or Frank's okay alter pretty generic ah water soccer may usually running at six hundred dollar range installed they might be a little bit depending on your area but a colleague and an echo water or the two companies that basically invented waters off there\nUh-huh and I if I was to bring out the recharged tank and replace it\nWhen it was no longer making sock water yeah that's why the original commercial hey how's it going man because you'd be out and he'd have to come exchanged attack uh-huh Atlanta land the uh\nThe first automatic water software that you put salt in on your own and didn't have to have to exchange tank\nThing okay and let's see I was actually bought out by the echo water company ... yeah that was a privately held company but at any rate uh they\nCreate in the water softer that uses the algorithm so it only to the water or recharging when made it so it might only recharge habitat order of attack\nOkay ... ... says that they've both water and salt and rennet charges from bottom up\nSo ... that we're all the other brands unless the fat does run out every ... done it at all was the same direction grading rivers are bands and the bad and then they lose their softening capacity over time\nYeah yeah I'll go water it may in\nFares Martin salt savers and you get 'em in the big box stores or you're gonna course bio from one of the dealers and they range anywhere from three hundred bucks at the big box stores all the way up to two thousand\nDollars if you're getting a just a unit if you get a A R o attack another grandad or you go to the big box store get one that's made by them cleanse ... uh and beyond that under two hundred dollar\nSure I'd tell you I like I said I've had three water saucers and there's definitely different qualities out there\nUh I mean for sure uh the one I have currently I'm it softens water are significantly better than the other two did and um\nSo

activist or he is an independent voter he's not a Republican or a Democrat and we're going to talk about ah\nKanye West of the White House in just a few moments and and and what impact that will have on the black your memories of America but I Want to give you a chance to sort of jumped into the conversation that we're already having about\nThe issue of up when is when does protests become a mob on the use of even the term mob is now being bandied about because the president is used to describe the Democrats and uh in in the recent demonstrations that have taken place in Chicago over\nThe Jason Van Dyke or you know murder trial ah there were a lot of people in the streets there were lots of protest right nothing really turned out\nHorribly violent now but were these mobs I mean you you were in those groups or mobs\nNah nah I wouldn't call it a mob\nUm but the thing about and I was you know you guys off camera the thing about America we want freedom of speech into we say something against\nSomething or someone says something against what we believe in it but that's not how freedom of speech works for a new species allow you to have your belief and also allow me to have mine and\nThen we try to find some type of coming out of the end those things\nUm I remember walking from Chicago to the White House and I came up on the block\nThat had a lot of like American flags on one side of the house and Confederate flags and I put up I remember making a posting in and making a video I said I respect them to have the right to have the Confederate flag along with the American flag because that's what makes America great\nIn America is great because you can have your values in court things and I can have mine and we can respect it was somehow in America we haven't it hasn't been the land of the free\nYou know um when you talk about gay rights will you talk about on the other side of the gay rights is Christian religious beliefs you know so somehow we got to find a way to agree to disagree more there was a mobs I'm actually a crowd like a baby\nBecause for three and a half years we have fought so hard to get justice um Fort Lee Kuan McDonnell a young man that was shot sixteen times and I don't care who you are\nEven a hunter don't shoot a of an animal is is usually one shot one kill or the meat or the furs bad you can't even use it and for him to shoot your ... McDonald down like a dog it did something to the very fabric of our communities white black or in different\nMajors you mentioned your walk to the White House recently walked in Chicago to the White House you met with some ... a congressional leaders while while you were there yesterday I don't want to talk about that as the interview went falls but I'm One of the things that got a lot of publicity last week obvious was Kanye West or went to the White House and a\nLot of people were describing it as a circus show or a minstrel show was done limit of CNN referred to it\nAnd and all the publicity when I enter the antics right of what uh what kind you were saying\nWhen you step back um how do you think\n... a presentation to the White House and how the media covered that presentation how do you think that was received by blacks that you know and I live with and and our friends ... well\nI'm I'm close with entertainers from our community in fact I'm close with a lot of ... friends I'm I've learned in my life that sometimes use the most\nCrazy is event to\nGet a message across right um and I've learned to look past the message or in order to receive those messages\nUm a lot of things that he said outside of the wearing the head or um I look at you as a father figure these types of things with um President Trump were poignant\nAnd it affected wait for that other stuff not poignant not wearing a hat with that poignant I mean I only allow another father Fager was that plane you know or not\nI mean it it rubs people the wrong way\nI Know it did that and your heart believe everything you said or do\nYou only know see I've I've learned to extract things does applicable to me and what's going on in my community so the things that are affecting us is that President Trump was about this in the stop and frisk here so he talked about that then he talked about um the\nThirteenth amendment that really does make it okay to have industrial complexes dad how men making eight cents an hour\nIn it for corporations and then you come out of jail and that same corporation will use that felony against you that you work for a while you was in prison for eight cent but won't hire you when you get your freedom\nI'm Danny talked about the school system which I Know personally is selling because I went to a covert military academy at school that costs Seventeen thousand dollars a year to go to high school and I came back to CPS my senior year\nIn which I graduated in Nineteen Ninety seven and I don't even remember homework assignment in my entire senior year and I was accustomed to those who hours of homework you probably agree with school choice then the\nUh Mike I Want to get your your your reaction because uh\nUh what was your reaction obviously you're Kanye West is not in your a demo mix and he was not in yours so got some good you know Chicago though what buddy but I don't know what you what do you what do you think of that as a political experience I don't want to say stunt\nBut it can experience ah that does that ring true to anybody I think it and\nPeople respond to persuasion and I think I'm going to draw upon Scott Adams who's gonna end up says he's the guy who came up here he is the creator of Dilbert yeah yeah and he's an expert on persuasion he thought what Congress did was astounding\nUsing the idea of visually saying to people I put on this hat and I feel like a Superman or what more can you say this creates in people's minds and and ... all kinds of weird stuff he kind of went all over like that from it was like free association that but he really did hit some really important point\nAnd I thought wow this is pretty cool I'll tell you one thing that that bothers me more than anything\nI'm being a white male I can be anything I Want and no one will ever say that I'm a traitor to my race or something like I can be a Marxist that can be a free market version but the moment that somebody\nAnd um I didn't pay my desk so much to society they're not paid it back to God and for every day I'd destroy lives I was incarcerated [noise]\nHow did you feel about destroying lives\nUm at first when I was until I went in the federal system isn't credible system if you can see incredible system for rehabilitation and actually steal has college and in in one of the biggest things is the ... program is the residential drug and alcohol program\nAnd they began the challenge my thoughts it begins to challenge the way I was thinking because I always thought that I was in forcing anyone to do drugs\nI wasn't I I didn't make them I didn't put a gun to their head but\nI didn't so I didn't see myself as part of the problem and then I looked up and\nI had begin to mature as a man while incarcerated and I was just like you know\nWhether they were going to buy from somewhere else and not someone else or not I steal contributed to the destruction of my community which is why when I came home and our young men were calling their selves savages and we're from Iraq\nI say all alone or you've got to be careful one who you call yourself and to what you answer too because in Chicago we're going to test it even from a white collar low or downtown\nWe are against the city like whether we like it or not the mafia's real in Chicago are some of the fabric of Chicago is a mob city or a organizational town\nAnd I'm I looked up and I was totally engulfed in it and destroy lives and and I had\nMatured and got my conscious back and I and I'm obligated to be part\nOf when you when you talk to are sixteen or Seventeen Eighteen year old on the street now which is one of the things you do Yes sir do they listen to you you're forty years old that that you're an old man to them well did they are they are they fearful of spending eight years of their lives in federal prison now as Carol numbers or this or is it a status symbol\nNow is not even a status symbol they just don't think about consequences let our kids not thinking about consequences and um what what what validates\nMe in the community is yeah they hear the the drug dealing they hear all these things but that's the worm wanna hook because when our real UN I'm like well this\nWhat I'm doing now this is how I'm I'm I'm saving lives and not have genuine conversations with them you know there's a statistic that was going around and I think the mayor pay that they had this program um they end up spending fifty million dollars to figure out the sixteen hundred\nPeople were doing the host of the crime right right so I walked in and I had I was at Loyola University law school and I walked in and it was um get out Chicago are you guys familiar with it with the program get in Chicago a get out of Chicago but\nThat's the organization that got the fifty million dollars and I came in and I had to live a variance and I looked in a room and I saw that you have people that we're talking about the demographic that they were talking about that could not even have a conversation with them they wouldn't talk to them\nSo for me how can you really represent or speak about people that you don't engage\nI felt like they are very disrespectful I felt like it's time to get out are comfortable homes churches in jobs and get down the best analogy of the best way I can put it is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beyond the Beltway", "city": "El
