Ottoman Empire in del back a hundred years ago the Ottoman Empire was real\nSticking them of south didn't even exist it they were the people out what about now what's happening now turkey and Saudi Arabia or two dominant players within\nThe Arab crashed and within that in that region and they both have objectives is probably like each other that's right and it's problematic how turkey suddenly

had been involved in Turkey for a long time not only ten years ago but you know ... do you think this was done to harm the prince politically\nI'm I'm I'm looking at as an option okay this is so obvious that it's him the the the his opponents have rallied to them they know that it causes a problem between the United states because of the strategic a relationship that we have them\nThey they also know that Saudi Arabia is is trying to at least some extent makes some peace with the Israelis so he's doing a lot of things that a lot of people in that\nKind of part of the world don't like and so for something as heavy handed is this to happen and mother everybody gravitates and points the finger at that guy I'm Wondering if there isn't somebody somewhere [noise]\nWho created a

[noise]\nBack in Chicago thanks very much for joining us we're going to\nTake a moment out from a our discussions of\nThe issues of the uh Guatemalans Hondurans coming towards the Mexican border and old Blake to the United states and also what what's happening in the middle east specifically what the United States is going to do and retaliation or in response to uh the murder of a ... at the Washington Post journalist ... Mr shaggy\nAnd ah I doubt very much whether either of those issues will be resolved by next week so will pick up the discussion\nBut uh this past we get one of the things we talked about on this program for a long time uh obviously is the the growing Hispanic vote in the United states or the numerous reports about or that it's the fastest growing population in the United states and and a number of Mexicans and and and people from from Central America\nOr coming to the country who are a citizen of the United states\nOr how they're being registered out of there being organized a primarily we are out of there being organized by the Democrats and then we hear all their ah ah being also a a a tempted to be organized by the Republicans as well [noise] well this past week\nNBC News uh which sends me things periodically uh they sent out a story questioning the reality and the potential and the and the potency of the Hispanic vote\nAnd they said or the Democrats in trouble basically because they may be wrong line too much\nOn the Hispanic vote and joining us now to talk about that article a joining us from his home in Austin, Texas he is the president of the Potomac struck Potomac strategy uh met a Mack Mack away it did I get it right\nThe Kobe Chicago New okay ... ... ... McCovey at oh like ... like the ballplayer very good\nJob yet yeah All right nice nice to have you with us we appreciate it I've got some guess around the table that may be asking some questions as well but give me the bottom line to that NBC News story and uh let me just summarize it is basically that things may not look as good for Democrats\nAnd the Hispanic turnout as the media and many Democrats have talked about for years\nYeah it's a great question British ... with you and I think that the central one of the central questions can determine which direction the terms go and just what Fifteen days from now is whether those minority voters that have been reliably democratic ah in recent elections whether they're going to vote based on the economy or whether they're going to vote based on immigration\nI'm Republicans obviously want them to vote on the economy span of an employment is at a record low says the data's being kept same for African Americans we have historically a low unemployment I think three point two percent nationally slower in some states\nAre very high consumer confidence high investment all those things are very positive and that has I said I said affected those us voters sub groups on the other side of ... and the Democrats want Hispanics to be thinking about family separation policy that the Trump stretching had in place\nFor a period of weeks um and so that's the question are they going to vote based on on that issue or are they going to vote\nBased on the economy one of the things we've seen pulling\nA is when the economy's good it gives delivers a chance to be concerned about other issues no one is concerned about the economy when the economy's good they're concerned about it when it's bad so I Do think there is some risk with the economy may not be the motivating factor now that said I Do think pocketbook issues matter I think people have let that issue contribute\nTo their view of the direction of the country are but there has been a a motivation question among the Democratic base\nNot I'm a white liberals but among Hispanics and African Americans are millennials so then what is going to have to say I mean I think we could she just shortly high turnout particularly in these charter districts in the house and in states where we have competitive Senate races\nUh but you know as I said before Democrats or ... have been able to reliably count on Hispanic votes in African American votes\nBut if you look backs the Obama years are the vote was was there when Obama was on the ticket in two thousand uh eight and two thousand twelve but it was not there and they made sure here's a two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen and so we'll see if that same dynamic is at play here\nEarlier in the broadcast all we were talking about the politics of uh the caravan coming towards the United states uh we were talking about her I mentioned uh just the video the video images that people are looking at on their television sets now\nCompared to the video images of a couple of months ago when it was children being separated at the U.S border now we are the video that that people are saying uh as we head towards\nElection day and and these are people from Guatemala and Honduras or carrying the end of the flags of their nations\nHeading towards the Mexican border and we're seeing how the Mexican authorities are responding uh with with tear gas and and and crowd disbursement checked snakes so my question to you is and again this is clearly a your opinion here but\nHow do you think those images are playing with Hispanic voters in the United states and specifically in Texas you're joining us from Austin, Texas how do you think those images are playing and well they are now\nYes are really smart question Burr's so I start by saying a few things\nA number one as a Catholic as a Christian I look at those individuals\nAnd I think about what great fortunate we all have to have likely been born or certainly be living as citizens in America so I have compassion for anyone that wants to come to the United states\nBut I think you are absolutely right to separate the issue of a child being brought to the border by an adult and how we handle that child was that we separate than what the law requires what court rulings require clearly that family separation policy was a total disaster from the very beginning and thankfully it ended almost immediately and they've been reuniting\nThose those children were those adults as quickly as they can uh this is different\nRight and I think that most voters look at the issue of immigration a with a keen eye towards what's reasonable and what's fair\nOr we don't blame children for the actions of adult ... children are viewed differently in our legal system than adults\nOr that the video there right right there that looks like an invasion doesn't it look like an invasion um and I would say this is someone who worked in Texas politics or Fifteen Years [noise] uh no there is no group of Americans that hates illegal immigration more that illegal immigrants\nLegal immigrants went about it the right way they follow the law they waited in line waiting their turn in some cases eight ten twelve Fifteen Years meanwhile you have a group here that who knows who's funding them who knows who's organized it\nOr they're trying to come to the United states illegally and kind of you know rush the border and overwhelm the border patrol to come in illegally so I don't think those images help the Democrats I don't think that they're persuasive to most voters I think most voters think we should have the border that we should have control of our immigration system", "show_name": "Beyond the Beltway", "year": "2018",
