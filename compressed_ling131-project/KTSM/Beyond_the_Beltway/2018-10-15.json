as it is that there could be some uptick and inflation and according to their mandate they have to try to create maximum employment and stable prices and one way they can keep inflation from getting

up on the conversation about ah the difficulty that the president as he has said that he does not want to cancel the multibillion dollar a airplane deal with the Saudis\nBecause Americans would lose jobs over that so the president's been steadfast in saying that\nBut he is also said that uh or the Saudis have said that there will be retaliation if they're swift there's going to be severe a response to this by the White House that's the term they use severe response and the Saudis have already said that if they're going to get a severe response or we're going to get a severe response\nIn response is that by the oil that's yeah I think\nThere's only two things that they could possibly do one would be oil the other would be a U.S treasuries they could maybe they have someone they dumped him on the market you know I'm sure that would even be too small to have any kind of an effect\nOn listening to us on WB icy and Sharon, Pennsylvania wants to add to that conversation about Saudi Arabia Tom nice to have you with us tonight\nOh are you there\nJudgment I in my mind at least as far as uh blaming Saudi Arabia\nA it is I Want to start you know just because someone in government may have killed this guy\nDoesn't mean it was at the request or a requirement of the government and you know even going back to nine eleven and a Nineteen hijackers and the Osama bin Laden and well you know they were all part of the Saudi family and so forth I I think that's ridiculous to necessarily say that there ... all one mindset\nI mean you know what were the arguments are concerned about arguments that we've had our own country at Thanksgiving about the run the Thanksgiving table about Republican than Democrat right so so I mean all I'm saying is that uh I think that uh\nThe whole Saudi situation is two key\nTo our strategy a strategic a needs in the middle east to a certain extent for oil but more so for a military position our military ... uh uh you know I I\nI Know it is it's a it's a very complicated relationship but as of this moment what we know or what we think we know based on the media coverage of it is that this journalist walked into the Turkish ah or the Saudi Arabia an embassy in in Turkey\nAnd he never came out again and allegedly allegedly ... the Turks have\nVideotape of him being murdered that's what really was world that's what they are at least alleging at the moment\nBut but I think we ought to step back in and said of the Saudi Government can you can you show us that the government at the top had nothing to do with this and are you going to do something about the people that that are\nInvolved in or who may have done this because I mean you know if you wrote people in this country and yes and in our own government or you\nCan't blame the whole government for ... hives\nExcept that there is way too many suspicions surrounding the aircraft flown into turkey with a Saudi officials on at the fact that it happened on ... ... split our embassy\nThat is run by the government itself it's just way too suspicious of the fact that this guy was a critic of the government I'm a you know there's way too much it's obviously government connected if this is actually what happened there is no there's no getting around and saying that that the taught folk didn't know that's just not\nA viable however I Will say this you know human rights violations happen all the time and I certainly you've got allegations of putting taken out certain members that he doesn't light and\nSo what if you're downloading lists and including journalists so we have to have a standard response here if this happens and um\nWe can't stand for it\nI'm Glad to hear but ... yeah I mean I and as I mean and you're absolutely right with with President prudent other strong men who have like this with the people with uh the former Russians who were killed in England or who were poisoned in England\nUm I really think this is it's a unique opportunity for President Trump to engage a group with whom he has had a strained relationship which is the media and sense does the Washington Post who he has had a combative relationship with\nUm if he draws the line I hate to use the term\nDraw a line in the sand it's overused but bad thing for Democrats to say yes she in Saudi and if she if she then says you know what I might disagree with the Washington Post but this will never stand\nAnd if he actually imposes with his with a severe punishment is and whether it's getting out of this uh out of this arms dealer for for airplanes um or or or whatever it might be if it is something that financially pinch is that country\nUm and let them know that this will not be stood for I think that is I think that that would be one of his most presidential moments and we'll see if he takes advantage of it like\nMiller Tom I I went to a complementary because what you want to wait for is evidence and facts and a motive means and opportunity all these things that we should always a way for\nAnd I I've become very suspect to the press and of course all we have one of the press reports on what happened I'm Sorry I I Want to wait and see the evidence as well which was also a\nDowngrade probably isn't anything that the president can do that's going to make the press like him no there's nothing you can go over there and an arrest the guy who did this and that wouldn't help as much water and also\nIn ... uh Iran if if\nWe turn our back on Saudi Arabia and yeah I mean the two oh boy you talk about two people at their at their throats you have Saudi and by rain right against Iran right across the Gulf and so forth and they are an ally I Know that they do horrible things but\nBut I I just love to see some facts some motive some opportunities a means but it also sensitive to medicines\nThat night I think that that that that tolerating the murder of journalists you're assuming it's a murder\nOkay I I I Am I Am assuming so swimming is dead if they that they show the body now that the other line legit allegedly a dead or alive they can produce the body so so from so from what we hear and I happened to watch the president's interview on sixty minutes but just from\nYou know from the three paragraph maybe if I were he had our\nDestiny of doing that opposite this program [noise] I've been told that many many times the exact opposite\n[laughter] still have this question though because ... has been such a key a participant and ... or ... in the ... alliance is for that region yeah how do we handle that that
