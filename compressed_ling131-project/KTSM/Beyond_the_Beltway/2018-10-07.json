crash in upstate New York in a press conference today NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt said this was a tragic loss of life\nI'm what's wrong with a fifty fifty nation\nI mean nothing's wrong I think you're the first question that you um you're asked you where we go from here really in a normal time in a civil time you look to the leader to move you forward I'm at we don't have a leader is moving his four rebel leader who um gauges in\nPettiness um divisiveness I'm and catches your point about the items that the Democratic side or the Republican side a democratic side referring to the Republican leader the leader of the country as\nA President Trump but to your point about implanting low\nUm you know that doesn't mean that equality is high that doesn't mean that the disparity in power and you know wealth and you know quality of living is you know I'm getting any better so yes it's great that unemployment is low but I mean you know first year economic student anywhere I can tell you that if you slash corporate taxes across the board the way this government has\nYou know there's going to be more corporate money and more jobs but gosh the end of a dress shirt rubber other Republican\nUh where do we go next\nThat's the question I I like to see us come together and he oh and I think Kathy or a\n... I'm Sorry Elizabeth made a good point about the country we went through the civil war the late sixties Nineteen sixty eight was probably worse than this but unfortunately I'm not optimistic and I'm just going to say it\nI I think that we cannot come together as a country until the Democrats except the election results and I think once that happens and they accept the fact that they lost fair and square in two thousand and sixteen we can start to come together Elizabeth said part of the issue\nIt it's a difficult question because it's true that under the rules of the game he got more electoral votes and he won however it's also true that three million more people voted for Hillary Clinton\nAnd you know we have created a situation where increasingly you can have ... you can lose the popular vote and when the electoral vote and it starts to create concerns about what does it mean to have ruled by with the majority if the minority keeps winning\nSo you you make a very good point actually because\nWe went through this and two thousand as well and then I was on your site I Want to ... when I I'm not like so hard core that I haven't voted the other side and I was very upset and I could I could feel it and I mean I I can sympathize or I should say empathize\nWith what you're going through but\nThe electoral college is that's the rules of the game and you've got to be changed by constitutional amendment is probably not going to happen so\nBut but it's their responsibility to ask Peter is they're responsible for both sides and again tonight we're talking about the Democrats that they have to educate their constituents of what the rules of the game are and the rules of the game are you know what if you win in certain states you're the president you can make all these appointments it doesn't make any difference\nThat Hillary Clinton got three million votes it doesn't make any difference it may it may make difference if you look at the at the campaign in congressional districts that if somebody wanted congressional district you know they say that the Democrats should probably be the congressman from that district that's not even the case\nYeah I mean the simplest rule the game that I think everyone I especially the Democratic side needs to appreciate is that elections have consequences period absolutely have rules to\nCathy rules so so the question is at this particular point what what is the worst thing in your opinion that the Republicans going to do now\nThink of the worst thing um I Can't think of anything really horrible probably in the poor\nWinters before winter snow we should we should be ... gracious you enter the president has the ability to be nine where he does not\nI watch I disagree I I I've seen it bore maturity on the president's part in the last couple of weeks that I have recently and I and again the bar is somewhat low there in terms of [laughter] but I mean if you look at his approval ratings that they're they're increasing you're increasing\nAnd I think that he handled the whole Kevin nothing pretty well\nWhen we come back we're going to get a reaction one eight hundred seven to three eighty to eighty

I read everything was beset and I would add you know why most of the governors offices across the\nCountry are occupied by Republicans at this time\nUm but you know I think it was ... earlier point about ultimately you know the electoral college in popular vote it leads to some weird square results so as I was saying on in during the break\nFor the five and the conservative majority in the Supreme Court were appointed by president who won the office and the president despite losing the popular vote the Supreme Court is supposed to be in tune with sort of sentiment and the direction the country's going and that you know ...\nAre sort of sentiment couched in the constitution and interpreting constitution but there I mean again if you actually look at the Supreme Court decisions you'll see again and again sort of a tip of the hat to where the country's going um and that's just that's just the way it is so\nI mean as Supreme Court justice should not make any decision based on what the country are the people are feeling they're supposed to make decisions based on the constitution\n[noise] this is Brandon Anna Maria island of those key\nTake Florida where you can discovering intimate downtown and cabbage see now it is time on campaign\nAds fresh fish for dinner [noise]\nEven tour marking winery just minutes from all the lord I Do often [noise] Brandon Anna Maria island lung damage to the plane you know what is it on line and brain can combine and dot com\nAnd it rained on mine and not calm\nEl Paso help on a dot com present the world's worst boss but one of those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a\nGold on corporate ... how are you from Africa\nAround you and you clearly said we want quality not quantity of property I I'll go oh well like my mother taught me and my first you don't succeed cut your losses are run by\nDon't Rio de but find your perfect global employee I El Paso help on a book called local jobs that work El Paso help on a dot com present in the world's worst books but one of those jobs don't you know jobs like looking for anyone with a both will just call him a date they didn't know\nWe're getting applications from jugglers in tightrope walkers\nI just posted on a national jobs aren't there this job can be a balancing act and you have to juggle many tasks\nBut the job is for head of accounting some of the applicants and ... have you met the guys in accounting their animals\nDon't Rio de even find your perfect global employee El Paso help on a book called local jobs that were [noise]\n... now just hearing you come down to drill merit how\nDo you are you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on ... avenue and candid open ...

watching it on YouTube you're not watching this but if you're watching us on Facebook you should be able to be seeing us and again the best way to confirm that with us is to send us a note or give us a call one eight hundred Seventy three eighty two and then we're working to to to figure out what happened I was like I just want to make a point ah\nThat I asked the the gas before the break and that is on the issue of all of a woman and what should women do\nI Hope what happened last week does not dissuade women from coming forward\nTo tell their story to a local jurisdiction or to to their therapist to their previous to their pastor to to someone I think the lesson is however is that if indeed you're going to go public I mean in this particular case\nDr Ford trusted in her local a democratic representative\nOr she a trusted Dianne Feinstein\nShe told their story she asked that her name not be moved forward and that speaks to to Josh is concerned about how do we get to the bottom of that because she was outed by a Democrat if it wasn't one of those groups it was her lawyers out or ... or ... she became a good friend she did not want this to happen\nAnd the big issue here is if you're going to make a story and you're going to reveal your story have\nWitnesses your best friend has got to be on your side from the moment you make your church\nIs that if that doesn't exist you're going to be treated like many people have treated Dr Ford and that is hey ... nobody nobody is is cooperating what you're telling so if you can't cooperated\nYou may have the same problem that Dr Ford did but if you can ... you have every bit of responsibility and not not just because this is the ... time in our society\nYou need help and and someone if the statute of limitations has not passed maybe should go to jail and that's and that's your\nResponsibility when many women have a witness when they're sexually assaulted or they're not there there is no witness yeah so that I I I disagree with that but they were when they your\nGirlfriend the next day would you tell some I'm not saying that you showed this is the saying is what lessons can be learned\nIdeas I might worry it now where every it'll be willing to women shaking their head and I know that every day that\nHaven't but then if if I tell a threat and girlfriends the next day that doesn't make it so again there's no proof there is no witness my telling somebody doesn't make it without suggest that\nI that women just unfortunately have to be more careful and it's not even their fault you can just be walking down the street and it can happen\nHappened I Would point out that that I mean in retrospect yes there are things that Dr Ford could have done differently but she did take a polygraph and she did pass it and I'm guessing that she felt that that was cropper it is she did have her medical records which she didn't want to turn over without some security that they would not have been\nMade public which I think it's a reasonable fear given everything that we've seen so\nYou know if she didn't handle it really mean it this isn't her this isn't what she does know and I mean I I think it almost speaks a little bit more to her credibility that it was a seamless and perfectly organized and strategize I\nI really feel bad for a doctor for it I feel like she was ill treated by her attorneys who apparently didn't tell her that the Senate Judiciary committee was willing to go out and interview her California there's a lot of stuff that that is just really really strange here and that maybe she's being used\nAt the poster child of a movement and she didn't want to be\nSubmitted this anonymously somewhere in the summer and that should have been respected and and it's it it's either as Bruce set her lawyers or somebody in that in times science things office that leak the editor and here we are\nAs as an attorney um doesn't and attorney have the responsibility to communicate to their client any at all communications that might affect their case\nThey are there and you know there are some sort of like there's always exceptions or you know if that could lead to someone harming someone or or killing some on those exceptions but I just want to kind of refocused is for one second if you're on the fence as to whether Christine Blasey Ford was you know credible truthful\nOtherwise um when\nKavanaugh I'm Brett Kavanaugh now justice cabinet step forward after she testified\nAnd gave the response that he gave which was blatantly partisan\nInvoking guy you know resentment over the election and the Clintons insane as liberal conspiracy seeing something like what goes around comes around that is not something I Want to hear from my local county judge 'em you know and they're running for office because to me that sounds like I Am going to have a chance I'm going to be\nPresiding over cases some point that these liberal groups including for example the ACLU I I work with the Asia only they spend a million dollars opposing this confirmation\nUm and now he's going to have a chance how can you be completely neutral when this organization\nBefore him repeatedly you look at his dish will record I have it in in the appellate court Ninety three percent siding with ... with Carl when we're there ... the same but if it if the way that he was treated by the media and by the Democrats on that committee\nI don't blame him one but I thought that they performed brilliantly and I ...\n... what do you really believe and I I I Divide his testimony and the two things there was a prepared statement where he was he was he was he was upset and I think most people would would understand why he would be upset\nA and he was angry and it was sniffling and he was almost a breakdown big and I I don't think any of that was was was fake there's\nBut then when it got to the ... with the centers don't you think he overstepped their bounds on more than one occasion when he starts asking questions of senator clover\n... once said there over the edge did there even with the editor finally ...\nJustice ... imagine can you imagine anyone justice Rehnquist Justice Scalia anyone\nHaving that sort of demeanor\nNew money spent attack like this unfairly and the way that the ... these Democrats said within hours of him being nominated that they weren't going to support him so what what were they opt to do they ... they weren't out to try to get to the truth or the bottom line of this they were out to just for this man\nIt was Eighteen I grew up in Louisiana and everybody was drinking the water ... and but you know that you really did not have a drink in high school\nOkay I mean I I'm a college I'm a I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna ... admission\nHere uh I I did that drink beer in high school I hate beer I don't [laughter]\nI'm the completely opposite of breast tissue Supreme Court nomination by alcohol\nAt all I think we should bring prohibition back I'm like well\nI don't drink I Know I don't know yet but\nBut I Want to say when he said that he was drinking legally in high school because\nKnew what was legal and what was it didn't really\nSee something truly just the the voters out there um you know the confirmation vote is not necessarily the last word on justice cabinet um if the Democrats seek a house up being a power of the house um and if you lied under oath um that is a high crime or or misdemeanor\nOr which of course they're brown who's lived through the Clinton impeachment of a no now Supreme Court justice has never been impeached but this is all the more reason to keep in mind that elections have consequences\nIs that a good idea for the Democrats to talk of like the I mean I'm not saying they should be tree requires two ... already talking about he's got he will be the chairman of the uh uh\nThe Judiciary Committee in the house if the Democrats take control I mean should the Democrats to be talking about I think most people now whether regardless of what the last thing you want to hear is about ... cabinet 'cause you're like up to her well I Hope they talk about it because I think that's going to play right into our\nOur ... actually I I was counseling a congressional candidate not long ago who are in the question comes up for people who are running for Congress would you vote to impeach the president and my advice to him which also is my belief\nIs that to say that you would vote for impeachment when you do not have any idea as to the facts of the situation I mean yes there are things that Trump has done that are traveling to New York times article on the Trump family's finances it was very troubling to see what the president but\nAnd and but to say why yes I Would vote for him teach him because I Am blindly partisan that one doesn't play and I don't think it's going to play for Brett Kavanaugh either\nI think I think there's where was that I may part someone I think part of the reason it is [laughter]\nWhat part of the reason I think the Democratic party has lost so so much is again I mean just sort of soft pedaling in less than you are but sort of soft pedaling the message and actually eventually having no message people want to hear I mean if I were that Canada I Would say look I don't know the facts but at the facts don't work at ...\nAbsolutely do everything my power\nTo step forward and bring every speech minute let me ask you this question do you believe that Michael Ettlinger Audi did he help or hurt the case against rod capital\nYou know as a as an attorney one of the things that I remember having heritage my brain is if you got a weak argument don't feature it which is you give the other side and in a laser beam focus to attack and I think that's what he did he brought this kind of you know his own and I I like some of his stuff but all hot I'm questioning\nHe brought his own ego into this and he brought this person who has
