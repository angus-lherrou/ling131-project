Monica ... uh and uh others in affords camp in front of the committee and\nHe could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if\nThat happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should should to here's here's the\nAnybody capital allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied yeah you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd it a little what if this was coordinated if it and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who was involved you know there was one guy who or what was it su he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill [laughter] wouldn't believe\nIt or the IRA yeah [laughter]

been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you

may be and and and you get it in your career and family and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is that now that is the ... bill that's the combination\nOf post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation ... doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\n[noise] that are leaving it it is that

funny to me yeah so that's that's what I've what I've experienced ... you know\nSo uh you know one of the things that when I when I uh was\nI feel like do they tell you he looked like somebody\nDon't you don't want to do they do know that you know how bad it is somewhere colonel Sanders is like I I look like Glenn Beck I don't know [laughter]\nI was going to go to a different direction I don't

it's a new world set or the other [laughter] I was a ... now this isn't helping because history I'm going into what's going on what I propose to my wife yeah she said no and uh and what do you ...\n... ... what year was a citizen the nineties okay yeah okay [laughter] the rational respond to write the nineteenth alright yeah I'm just trying to get an error I'd run out here you have those\nSo she said no and she said the reason why is because we don't have God in common and I said I'm you know I I Believe in God among everything and she said you don't go to church and I said I see you every Sunday after church for and every time\nYou come home talking about the people who were honking at each\nOther and yelling yeah they're running the park and oh why oh yeah yeah I Know

if you like you see someone on TV and they're given a run down and you just go\nThat's not right it doesn't seem right that guy's lion mhm you just know because everyone is a human like you can spot in sincerity and why the everybody loves that is because everyone when people get mad at my jokes at the live show because you're going to come and the whole crew is going to come tonight\nSo to get to come and I asked yet or bring up on ... ... people people are like stabbing each other we have a ticket to that's what I that's our goal\nRight yeah I mean it's a good clean comedy show you won a

comedy is comedy hard in two thousand Eighteen I go\nI think it's way easier because you don't to to cross the line you have to say anything\n[laughter] right mhm it used to be in the nineties you had to say the most profane mhm disgusting I never even I Can't believe this is coming out of someone's mouth but in in two thousand anything we heard everything we've seen everything ... so it's kind of

what you really are feeling and want to say but you don't\nAs I I Can't believe you said that yeah but I live a joke at my act about uh like everyone like we're all good Christians and have you ever

four years because it every button yeah but what do you have what's at the bottom of that you're a ... you want to be the person in church that and then the real human yeah is the guy we all have a dark\nSide yeah ... is the guy now might be something might be better or worse than others some ... some might be against the law and some direct sunlight actually some of the reasons why the the reason why the outrage and the culture and people were coming after cabin are because you were like\nIf if if we can notch him down I feel\nLike that's why the tabloids exist that is what are the outrage exist because you'd think these people are above view the people listening that are ... are like Glenn Beck is up here\nYou know the people listening now okay how are you [laughter] you know

love Jaffe and then they did to us because we hate him we like I really hated him\nI Know I had to write a oh I had to write a memo to all of the you know producers and everybody involved in\nTeam fat and uh and I was like nobody can be more surprised me\nMhm yeah but really bad guy but yeah you know it out in the ... really impressive\nAll right so a pack right from pat gray at least welcome to the program glad you're here I'm Glad to be here are you there yeah yeah I I'm a I'm a it's a forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote\nFor the Republican side that is going away\nI'd love to get first your gut reaction and then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear and then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute you're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for capital it is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... you cannot cast your vote in any of\nTheir way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other\nMy gut was see America with my daughter yeah right um yeah OK Now\nLet's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah from Montana okay so ... from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them eat this is one of the most important in game changing votes\nOr of maybe his lifetime or it will if\nIf the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left you can do this to anybody ...\nHow do you just because my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still won the vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's ... ... let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ...\nWell no well you know I mean it but again let's say mansion switches right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican [laughter] so let's say ... signifies today or is that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's in Ted is forty nine forty ... it's not it's not a sure thing you need Danes I've got to say like\nMy it's it's hard with your gun was title with my daughter but in in the end you you rethink that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was my initial thought was this is really important\nI think of my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screw this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it\nYou know two o'clock or that is still what a Montana time noon or\nEleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was supposed to start at noon started it six started at three and I'll be there\nAt the ... vote right like move the vote you know they're they're planning on doing by the way if they need Danes they're going to delay the holy until it comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need him right now they looked like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy thing to do you could just\nIt doesn't have to be tomorrow to no no they can relate to that on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but there's that risk of like you know some new accusations over into the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "El Paso", "day": "05"}
