on someone wouldn't disqualify him forty years later for the Supreme Court face for all the wonderful a room you're giving him what leeway but here's the situation where they're just like well\nWhat it what it does say with us is that it plays into a larger picture of this man he was in his anger when\nHe was drinking and the shows that he's capable of doing these things\nSo if you don't have anyone reached further I Know if he would have come on and he would not have been angry\nI Would have thought something was up\nBecause nobody does that to me my family nobody nobody is going to make those charges and smear my name without me at least responding forcefully and then if you don't like the anger\nI Want you to hear me clearly I did not have sexual relations with that ... thing yeah he looked and they praised him for being angry about it they praised him for his forceful and this\nYou can tell the president was angry he wants to get back to the business of the of the American people\nSo no matter what he did it would have been a problem\n[noise]\nThey keep moving the goalposts now here is here's my plead guilty to Donald Trump\nFirst of all\nI don't believe any other

hearings\nThere's no way they would have said that cost is too high they just wouldn't have done it so hey points for Donald Trump for having us fine and go and this is garbage\n[noise] be\nWe're in this situation now and if there is nothing if there's ice fights\nDon't give up the ship do not move because if you move now they're going to do this every single time and you cannot cannot\nGive any ground without being sad and I don't think this is a chance at all if Ford\nIs those those charges turn out to be right you noticed you notice the media is not furthering the Ford and testimony\nThey're no longer on that yeah nobody in my ... she's been abandoned already right she's done she's done she served her purpose she bought time they used her as a pivot to something new\nOkay so there there there's nothing new there there's nothing new or the press would be saying well you you watch what's going to come out this FBI there they're not saying that they're not nobody has come out\nAnd said you know what I was so offended by how forceful he was and I wasn't going to say anything but I Know that that happened\nNone of that is happening what\nIs happening is people are saying you know I was for him and I wasn't going to say anything but in [laughter] you know as soon as he started to say he was he was an altar boy\n[noise] I remember him drinking so that's what's coming now and they're going to go after perjury you watch that's by the end of the week that's what they'll be talking about\n\nIf Donald Trump please please Donald Trump the only chance you have and the only chance the Republicans have if this thing goes awry in any way\nYou have to have a plan and announce it in the same press conference that you say\nYou know he he you know quit or vote went downhill went down in ... ran down whatever it is whatever it is whatever it is that press conference you must say and here's my next nominee and we're going to have it done before the election\nNow the only in my opinion the only one that can stand that is likely because you don't need how long did they do take the due to the ... sessions\nAh well ah I mean he was he brought in January ... he was inaugurated and then a February eighty was the vote went down so let four weeks three four weeks for an hour we could probably go to the factory and other things going on case\nSo you have four weeks to do it that's what you have now for the election you have four weeks\nThe one who can get that the ... the one who doesn't need all the FBI checks and all of that is likely\nIt's already been done he's the only out of your get done quickly yeah he's the only one that can be done that quickly or another senator but Mike Lee is the guy and Michael is the only senator on the list\nYes so so you've got you've got Michaeline you could select Tim let's just say Brett Kavanaugh's hit by a plane tomorrow [laughter] which I wouldn't\nChange accident but it could happen I mean it happened in Indiana Jones a and and and ... one of them are the guy with their fighting on the ... yeah yeah I was trying to run if\nThat happens to Kevin well this one they won't be delivering the arc in that plane there'll be delivering ah [noise] the New York times are playing but anyway [laughter] so let's just say\nAnd it makes them into sausage ... uh\nYou need to announce that Mike Lee is the candidate we're going to have this done by the election there of course going to go crazy because Mike Lee is ... ... pro life uh and he would vote\nFor him in the bottom line is he cares about the constitution that anything I mean he will vote he will vote the constitution and he will also vote for a ride of life he's not going to go in there with an agenda but he is a right to life guy so Kevin I wasn't good enough here's Mike Lee\nThere's not going to be there's no drinking parties would likely there's just no drinking part maybe and then it'll be like Mike is like\n\nThen now look

I think it explains so much about what we're seeing with a capital case right now I think it's\nI think it's absolutely in line with ... well it's amazing because I think a lot of people if you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing teams a lot of people would just be like all the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are Democrats\nAnd they sound completely insane about this happen often yeah completely off the rocker these are people that I Know people who I'm friendly with\nAnd the extent that they'll go to here to try to take all male crime ... in in the last twenty five years and apply it to this one guy where there's no evidence that he committed any sort of crime\nAnd that sort of jump in not it's not just hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base\nIt's based in post modernism ... explained in the book and you'll see the times I look at a time like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying these things that that didn't make any sense and there's an easy political explanations for all that but not real\nThe real basis of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book\nBecause I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories in the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah uh you wouldn't find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why\nIs because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels uh and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a goal and their goal is to disrupt the hierarchy and the patriarchy\nAnd to collapse the system that\nWe have yeah and if you've ever had someone who has an addiction problem in your life hooked us up something you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blow their job why would they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's not a book about surrender it is a book about stand and fight just fight the right way\nJust know who your enemy is the tactics that they're using and fight the right way it's called addicted outrage we'll talk about it on Thursday with you so if you're reading it tried to finish it by a by Thursday if you haven't started yet please do\n'em and uh and then join us on a joined us on\nThursday [noise] okay [noise] um

M. news on the hour and a half trafficking whether all day stay informed with El Paso as news radio six Ninety ...\nMm Mm Mm\nIs Glenn Beck command All right we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on Kevin ... which ...\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned all yes we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you all that stuff but the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role that relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr a or a or I'm a\nAttorney general general attorney general would be a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidate who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there's an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this mhm there's a separation between the capital case Neal is a case\nOf the cabinet case happens at thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but that's one difference ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYes you to very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we know now remember with Ford we have no even since that there was a relationship of any\n... between a word and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that really got both of those little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does what did she\n... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor gets it wrong of course\nWell yeah well in their words case they both have a notes from their donor who around those cases you have the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the\nDon't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before\nAnd this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me yeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident [noise] um and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with though of course I'm a Ford has name\nSeveral people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborate is your story in any way\nOr the dolphins a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures\nAnd they are those are things that she showed two co workers in real tired\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had like Kavanaugh said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was yesterday or tape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ...\nWe have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with the ...\nAnd we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I don't have any him out more we have a preponderance of evidence in in the Alice in case the", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "02"}
