you\nKnow the saying may you live in interesting times they always say oh that's a Chinese curse that it's really not no it's not may you live in interesting times is not a Chinese in fact the first place that we can really find that being said is in the Yorkshire Post that's in England in Nineteen thirty six\nA guy stood up in parliament his name was a sir Austin Chamberlain and he was um uh he was a meeting with union is and uh he spoke of the grave injury to collective security by Germany's violation of of the treaties so he said\nLook not so long ago\nSpent ... years of service in China and there there was this old\nChinese fellow who told me of a curse may you live in interesting times and there is no doubt that this curses followed up\nOn us so it's not a Chinese it's this this guy is the only one is the only place we can really find this but I've always liked that\nBecause I don't think it's a curse it's a it's a it's just a saying and you decide if it's a blessing or a curse I

Trump tweeted this morning that king Solomon said his country it's working closely with turkey to find the answers ... citizen and frequent credit every odd was last seen October second walking into the Saudi conflict and sample\nAnd I ended up going in one of these hey hey\nUh to publish open access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low\nUm review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned it was fun I live in LA fun right hum that innocence\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight that um but yeah so\nWe learned our lesson we we took the criticisms we got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use paid published journals in any sense\nA secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollars they charge\nLike a couple of thousand ... ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is some big problem and I hope people\nContinue to address a secondly we decided that that\nUm we would use the highest ranks journals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one and then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened\nIf our if we hadn't gone crash and burn complete failure than\nUm [noise]\nThat would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ... ... and it's since he's been recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took may be that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm\nMy two collaborators worked also very very hard\nI'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same and I talked to hell and the other day yeah ah so this was in ...\nIn the men's amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of\nBackground in some of this but this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our paper spared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career is to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars imbedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published\nIf people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process but typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven\nAnd\nSo we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know you had twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven Thirteen would have gotten in in the end are we not gotten cold\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so are we as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and an article where they got a little gold star for [noise] alright are sponsored this half hour is zipper critter zipper critter

inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it just as an act says it's a solid as say that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back game as a possibility\nWants to determine how privileged they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um\nThe more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the ... the classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and there's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to sit in that without being comforted\nAnd so they actually wanted to make a terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what\nAlready exist in a great deal of the a feminist Senate race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrified this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that\nYou would expect out of a scholarly papers they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter and so on but um

college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package than what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty

candidates which by the way it will not be enough\nTo ... to cover the field there's gonna be a lot more than ten I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all the all the big names are for it already there are many of them are co sponsors of the bill uh it\nSeems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers and races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stories will go through this tomorrow but\nI just want to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected\nRight it might have to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this is a this is an idea that I'm In and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which it may not want that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight as they should run themselves in the city is getting run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's ... the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out right\nAnd you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could er race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThe way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things can be passed\nBecause there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much slower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for wrecked trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas like no that's the opposite it's the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme\nCourt and this story the constitution of the United states has failed\nOr you just arguing for a king right with these several stories in a row the mic give you the argument for a came\nRight I mean okay really\nThey've failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland or Portland but on the outside object sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week\nThe Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ...\nCan anybody just get up and start directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise]\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] what what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now\nYou can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a a law and order march\nAnd anti fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law the browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and then the mayor ... released\nA statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse he's trying to make it sound as if\nThe police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nBut they act and they're just the bugs they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no way to win it's a great observation there are two\nIs Brian birds of century Twenty one haggard he\nNow besides having a brilliant system of attracting buyers which
