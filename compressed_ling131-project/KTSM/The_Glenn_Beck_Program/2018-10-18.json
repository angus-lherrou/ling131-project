I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist with an e or he'd written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness was going on in ...\nSaudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a ... a first of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it Fahrenheit nine eleven was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on with that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one with the biggest a political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty you'd have to go all out there and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis in was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven\nUm right so this is not a new accusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about flooding in\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to the FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Obama was plenty friendly with them\nTo exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done anything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point down there and it wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem was\nNinety percent of the media coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker\nWho is tense of right and we're never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again\nThe big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and you let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like nine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who's ... who's incompetent\nBrock Obama wait what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything\nAnd it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and five hundred years or ... or the me there was a decision you made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision in in the minds of people who want to praise the zoo and\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was a risk in the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean it you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and\nWeighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this the opposite is what they feel about Trump\nNow that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally\nIf for Rocco bomber was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump that he doesn't care it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something\nIt's just the you know the the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who's a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's brought about by or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they've made a decision and MSNBC certainly on this board and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is our this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by mistake of falling with your own self but something happened there and ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still well that'd be age\nYeah should be um breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia\nUh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that it's\nKind of I mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship right I mean that there was there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision as the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests are harmed long term\nBy a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we did a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the north Korea anymore so she studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things\nAll over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a columnist is a big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it\nAnd they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up working for an American newspaper\nSo it's a big story and the and the details rounded are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and if it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nOil I that that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply well I think we get scant little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got to all your\nUh T's crossed in ... before you take any severe action I Would\nThink now look as a global market anyway yeah so if it all affects ah each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision\nOutweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we think we see that happening too infrequently or over the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back

possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and certainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story\nWe don't know um but\nThe other people in Cory Booker do not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not at all not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty candidate\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and he and his ... and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually had evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nThen again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different look let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating after I\nThink of how recent is Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says\nI Know these people uh they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she one day I got back what an avid mountain of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and yeah I remember that party and I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already were in full and conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on or something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident but just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party a Kurd none of the incident happened just that the party occurred\nListen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape\nNot sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton brought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to look down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth in Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was getting like perjury charges or something against her\nFive people said ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so not while for one person who was at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after it occurred\nUh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick where they bloody lip and torn pantyhose in their shared hotel room broader he explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband that her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here so she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe ... and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there that don't work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended\nNewspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred there was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence yeah that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored\nFor ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats\nAnd now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now after they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again\nTo them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump\nAnd that's why they have no more used for them\nBut I mean Bill Clinton goes along it still makes a big levels speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre\nAnd the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should\nTake their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else\nThat crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened I mean that is what that is the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we're now supposed to go through these kangaroo courts and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it is now or standard\nThat's been sanity it's insanity and yet you have\nHillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference uh was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there was some ... and show evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy their so pissed off about that and they do not want I'm running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are they are very much trying to destroy him at this point\nBut what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then my club and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even

the morning called the daily and today's was about Lucy K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes at odd part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alley that much if any allegations of him doing something\nThat against you know motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where um he\n[noise] again like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her because I guess he was breathing heavy\nOr something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamic power dynamic absolutely yeah power makes you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he using ... he wields incredible power right in this country now mine credit ...\nFired at any job in the nation any job you're a sarcasm is just reality in the situation that they're going to go back to what they were saying they're saying oh my gosh it's some of them people were other comedians\nAnd one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian ah\nAnd they were talking and I guess he thought there was a vibe there is something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was who is this is his shtick ... and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it in force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he learned to do this thing which is unbelievable obviously ...\nYeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault and the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ...\nHe admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nA make it easier well he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat the one I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the answer to that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other ... other comedians careers is theoretically possible\nBut that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's evidence that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again she's making a weird assumption there yeah and\nWe just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nAnd listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a

the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision listen\nAll the people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy but he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's never might never he says never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never misses an admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place where you would say\nParticularly to a female customer who is somebody that's on at but but you know I

would know that right uh you know maybe he did I I don't see how that's all that uh\nThere's no way to know that into the conversation but bill there's no way to know what if the ridiculous thing to to complain about and I you know this is one of the most annoying parts about this\nIs the\nAccusation that everyone who supported right capital was a terrible person even from people like you know there are people on the left but you know I'm sure a restaurant I certainly know them and they were against Kavanaugh because they believe ah you know Dr Ford mhm ... but the accusation there is similar\nMost it's implicit essentially and everything that they're saying which is they accuse us\nOf believing forward\nAnd around about sort of way they're accusing us of saying we know she was assaulted and yet we still want them on the Supreme Court right and like no right well no thing is if we thought he was a sexual assault or we wouldn't want them on the Supreme Court we just don't believe he is\n... you have not provided any evidence to bring us over that line right and just because you happen to believe it with no evidence by the way you happen to believe her is your prerogative but you don't accuse me of a bowl of sinking her story was credible I didn't\nI didn't think her story was credible I I think I don't think it happened yeah\nI don't either and it hadn't been I think it happened with somebody else\nMay be but he may not and so is this is a I don't think it happened at all to be perfectly honest with you now of course I Can't prove that I wasn't there but the ... when when something like this happen and it's the same thing that happens with any big public official\nOr in this way if you have someone who doesn't report something it doesn't even tell their friends for multiple decades then talks about a party that they couldn't rent or where it was and then they tell you but the people who were there and they can't remember the party\nLike what are we and the person who's making the accusation has an overt\nUh dislike for the party of the person or that they're accusing there is a person who has been an activist is march women's march rallies is is an obvious Democrat\nLike you have to take in ... motivation\nForty years later into account I always started skepticism I had this idea that basically I think people almost like it's going to sound bizarre but I think if people almost like an innocent until proven guilty it's a weird way of seeing about it yeah I Know I Know I I don't jump right to the guilt you die and leave the survivors\nNo no well you don't believe survivor but if you're a survivor the indicate that this it missed events occurred\nCalling her a victim or a survivor indicates that you know the event occurred I Would ever called the victim I called them survivor but when I when they leave I\nEver survived this assault by this man if they've assault didn't happen they didn't survive it and [laughter] yeah I guess we could all call ourselves survivors because we're all alive and we've technically survived everything that's happened to us so life yeah like I don't know what her motivation was I don't know it's possible\nOr a ... a million things are possible you said it's possible it's possible really happened and were misjudging the evidence while she make it up\nWhy would she lie about it that's a good question because I Love this one mhm possibly could lawyer motivation [laughter]\nNot whether that gives you should like this I don't know when I taught at school we talk about

a swastika on their door for nothing you can like say well I was a victim of of of anti Semitism or I was a victim of white supremacist\nNot the entire Supreme Court on the line of course you can find someone who's going to falsely accused which they do we know for a fact the fifth accuser recounted allegations after he made them\nWe know the ... the fourth accuser didn't even bother to write any information on their letter including their name or where they lived or when it happened we know that the third accuser went to Michael ... and no one including Democrats believe them we know that false accusation we're littered all over the store\nAnd the only two they even seemed ... seem credible to even Democrats were the first two and in the second one is the is that there's a ... they're right when they the person who made the allegation said I I was told by someone else so get was not a witness I was told by someone else that something like this happened I but I couldn't locate them\nAll right well I guess you could maybe take that seriously until the media didn't locate\nThe person and that person said no it didn't happen and she had to spend six days with our attorney to remember it even happened exactly\n... operating what evidence on that one either and there's and look the Fort one was only ... I think taken more seriously than the others because there was an obvious\nPerson saying no it didn't happen right like there were and all the other ones they were there were those people if there was no evidence proving that had happened here I'm In and of course obviously people like have it on his uh his or what this is worth saying no um but\nThat one was serious because she went in to you know took the step of going in front of the of the hearing and and and doing relatively credible job it recounting what she believed the story was who knows if it was true or if it was completely felt fall the idea that you can't pull one percent of the United states who opposes abortion so much that they're going to make a credible accusation\nAgainst someone but it's just completely false it's just an eight yeah of course you could do it I mean\nThat as we heard with Hillary Clinton she said there was a vast right wing conspiracy of people doing this like a ... that the media activists entirely foreign world where someone could lie about politics [laughter]\nI Know of course that could happen and I think likely did at least in for the five cases and probably and all of them\nAnd ... you brought up the high school situation in California where they called the mean girls um situation here where the five girls accuses one Seventeen year old boy of sexual assault and they they asked the first accuser\nAh why she would do this and she apparently told students that she would do anything to get this kid expelled from school now and they did accusing him of sexual assault or and then the second one said I just don't like to hear him talk\nI don't like to look at him I just don't like him that's why they accused him they didn't like him to really encourage\nOr how about the Ohio University student who ah got threatening notes about how they didn't want her in her elegy peachy lifestyle to them to be in the students' Senate anymore at Ohio University\nUh she was a angry and frustrated and disappointed she said I'm a ... you may find my me revolting and worthy of a threat of my life but in reality it's your beliefs that a repulsive you need to get this through your head you eh thing a whole I Am proud to be who I Am and nothing could say or do you ever change that\nBy the way the ... of course admitted to sending the threats to herself\n... uh or the woman and why would you do that yeah why wasn't clear motivation possibly be it's hard to do in this case it's not hard to detect with bright capital\nOr the woman in Texas who said a state trooper sexually assaulted her until of course the cam footage came out and her own attorney had to say we're sorry for bringing in this case we didn't know about this at the time\nOr the charges against the for dentist accused in Las Vegas of raping a ... a people and that was also found to be completely false\nAnd untrue or ah how about the racist receipt and we don't tip of terrorists to an Arab a person
