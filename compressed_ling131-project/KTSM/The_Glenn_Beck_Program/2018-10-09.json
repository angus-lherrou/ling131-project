think it's awesome and I want to talk about kind of a minor point I guess okay you're you're ... you're\nTalking about how am I going to come in and you know replace almost all the jobs and and I know you don't necessarily agree with every I bet you've said that we need at least on the conversation about\n... because of it and I\nYou know I think we need to be careful about even considering the I I think that there really is fear over a I to try to come in and ... yeah so I think that they want to push that starts socialism\nI think the AI um well it will certainly changed everything obviously you know we've run into this in the past and all the other technical write a\nNovel ... where ... you know the ... they were afraid that technology what's going to come and direct place their top steroid problem correct and so\nUm I understand that hey I is definitely coming and it's going to change things but it's not going to take over everything all the jobs you know in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachines and keep running and there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in or climbing in her house probably not going to do

chick\nFillet isn't known for their service and ice that let me ask\nYou this let me ask you this first of all just and I believe there's ... I don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ah what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than tape work unless I'm so I'm coming just for a different perspective having done that research that I Know that you have sure on that\nBut you know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they have to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and explain your options\nCase so Heather are there is a very and I can't remember the name of it on the uh uh this particular subject but I Will look for it uh there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made\nYes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that true a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal\nThan anyone else the bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago\nThe uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it is I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please\nSo you have to understand that there is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I or there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for\nIs it that will give people value what is it when we do hit high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent Bain capital's says we will have thirty percent of unemployment and it will be a permanent thirty percent unemployment that so you know is about the size of the great depression\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue in Kenya to open ...
