I knew I Would probably be a death sentence to me\nHe takes his fiance they get into a car and they uh drive up to the embassy the Saudi embassy in his ...\nHe says I'm going to go in I'm going to get the paperwork they're expecting me I'll be right back out wait for me so she did ours pass she starts to call the embassy she calls his phone no answer nothing\nIs it turns out a Saudi Arabia first denied that any of this happened um but uh we now know that they are about to admit we don't know to what extent\nUm but it looks as though he was interrogated tortured and killed he was then hacked into pieces and thrown onto a Saudi plane in suitcases and what happened from there we don't know\nNow there's an additional update today we have our secretary of state over in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the crown prince who are now saying privately that yes this was just somebody who went rogue\n... but it's kind of hard to believe\n\n[noise] the new information today you know is this coming from turkey so we don't know if this is true or not\nThere were two stories or one of the United states came out pretty quickly\nOr last week when this story broke and said we have evidence that this was ordered by Saudi Arabia and he is dead um but they never released where that came from they just released that this was a U.S intelligence sources say\nThat was the first Nick then the Turks came out and said that they had audio and video tape of this man's interrogation or torture and killing\nI don't know if they do there is a possibility that they have microwave technology that could listen if\nThe Saudi embassy was not a prepared to deal with that kind of surveillance you can get that kind of audio from inside of a building\nBut there's also another story that this actually audio arrived first with his fiance because he had an apple watch\nAnd when he went in he turned it on and it recorded and when it's finished recording it just uploaded to the cloud\nAnd downloaded to her phone I Hope to God that's not true for her sake I Can't imagine especially since we now are getting the story that this audio that we don't know yet if as if it exists\nIncludes his interrogation\nAh and then uh the the execution ers come in and the a head of the embassy said you can't kill him you can't kill him in here or I'm going to get into trouble and the what's described as the path all adjust\nOr from Saudi Arabia the guy who was in charge of killing and disposing of the body apparently said to the head of the embassy or if you want to live you need to get outta here right now otherwise your next\nThey knocked ... on conscious and he was unconscious for a while then you hear them apparently starting to\nGet all of the tools and everything ready in the room ready to uh start to chop him up he is still alive when they are ... him and apparently it is a gruesome gruesome tape\nWe again don't know if that is true\n[noise] this may be an

depends a lot on Biden it depends a lot on um whether she feels\nThat the field against her is weak which it is absolutely week but the bigger picture is that the Democratic party doesn't know what to do with Bill and Hillary Clinton\nThey don't know what to do with them All right so Bill Clinton and Hillary going on the road and they were in and talk to their devoted supporters\nThis isn't an accident [noise] this is a is a trial I mean to see how many people show up how enthusiastic they are a below say look when I was president we did all this and Hillary was a great a first lady as she did all this and then she was a great senator and she was great secretary's day that's what this is\nIt ... it up across the country to see\nHow it's going to fly\nBut if you think Hillary Clinton is just going to go away quietly into the night she's not she wants to be president and she realizes that the Democratic field as it stands now is extremely weak who's going to vote for Elizabeth Warren I mean that a non\nAmerican Idol [laughter] know rushed her yeah horrible\nCrushed to the Boston Globe thought it was doing a favor by saying oh yeah we got a little bit ah blood on average and then the Cherokee Nation the Cherokees themselves came as a knock it off where she's not Cherokee um this is a total Rosen fraud knock it off\nThe chair Indians themselves\nCrazy OK and war and he used that ruse as I say in my message of the day I'm Bill O'Reilly dot com today [noise] used the rose to advance occur in academia\nSo and this is a woman who thinks she's going to win an election she's not only in Massachusetts that may be at Oregon you know these states that she could get into the Senate but as a national viable candidate in a way\nBelow as in the ... the number one political strategist a do you ... how could she come out with this whole thing Elizabeth Warren without having someone on record from the Cherokee Nation to support or I mean I she got the ...\nShe has her grandmother who once told her when she was three that she had high cheekbones and that's because way way way way back um she was a chair or as a mother or you know was a source of all of\nThis but look I'm getting back to to backs a Hillary Clinton scenario um Hillary Clinton is a woman who is obsessed oh yeah All right so she doesn't fit in to the me too movement obviously she\nDoesn't fit in there because she has her husband um and she doesn't fit in to the far left even though she pander to them all the time because\nShe didn't receive Scully she's you know them\nYeah she's a system a Paul what they call in New York She's a Paul so but she she and her husband and I spent um I was at the Yankee game and I talked to Bill Clinton about twenty minutes\nOr so I mentioned to you last time I was on um she and her husband say you know what they may not like us they being the Democratic voters but we're so much better than what ... is up there now I mean Michael Bloomberg\nIs going to run for president of the Democratic ticket\nAnd you know outside of New York nobody knows who Bloomberg are very smart guy by the way stream Lee intelligent All right but he doesn't really have much of a chance but he's got a lot to do a lot of money and he'll be in there\nBut other than that you tell me if Biden doesn't go and buy it and I think it's going to be Ninety eight years old next year\nI'm ... and older senior citizen\nI I Will tell you this bill you know who I think is positioning for a run and I don't think in twenty twenty but I think the only twenty four I don't think it's going to be Hillary Clinton there will be the first first lady that becomes president I think it could be Michelle Obama\n[noise] maybe I I'm not sure whether Michelle Obama has the drive but certainly she would be formidable and then there's the rock and it's the it's the reverse\nYou know they're they don't have the resume I mean the Obama is if you even if you don't like 'em I mean NATO conducted themselves pretty well\nPraying near to the you know I'm not sure you need the ah the resume I mean I heard I heard the rock say you know if I'm going to seriously do this I I you know I've got a I've got actually runs something or can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\n... smashed that\nBut it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right you\nMight you know this is in her time the next time around you want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but into twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right

air force Jetta few minutes after take off from joint base standards and Marilyn prompting returns to the military airport no injuries were reported\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolute health for these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacred I think that there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS hounded um ... the ISIS people\nI've heard that they've kind of gone back and they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of society is that true we\nWe did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of ...\nSurgeons in in Iraq right now so they went underground you know and it it it was neighbors and just people who who've all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that\nWe were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens\nAnd things like that ... and the reason for that is because they they have no choice but to fight and die they can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because you know they looked like me are white guys read beard and ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys\nHad to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care at so yeah\nSo you went from that\nUm to say and I I've got to do I've got to keep doing this mhm\nUm and that brought you to Burma mhm right yes and\nNow you're working with an as rain fun yes in Burma yes and last week talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening mhm and you have an update\nForth yes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from ... where are they really are\nYou are telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all\nTogether slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago and met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to how the ... marine funds help okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's really really good thing um\n[noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in their eyes or done several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to have is because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so why why are they doing this why are they doing this these tribes [noise]\nIt's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma they want to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can they'll they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or surf class you have to basically serve the Burmese and also\nFor example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus they don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just adds a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it

I\nTend to think he's going to win as well I don't know about Eighteen I'm you know maybe I think they think tens possible though I mean a nine or ten is definitely possible um interesting in this poll first of all what you see is Greg Abbott who's running for governor here and lack of this\nIs winning by a much larger margin a usually is there I don't have the one and right in front of me but it's it's over twenty points yeah every I don't even think I've seen a sign for him here just yeah I Know 'cause you know there's so much he's up uh eight Eighteen points here so crews that by seven and St Paul were Abbott is up by Eighteen and what's interesting about comparing the results of the same poll is\nIt the same people the same people were asked the questions and so you kind of get a sense of where people are splitting up for example much more people are ... are voting for a great guy but that are voting for Ted Cruz out of the exact\nSame base the other thing that's interesting about it is the um\n... you think of it break bread\nCountry right in Texas mhm however are the poll shows that fifty percent of adult disapprove of Donald Trump's um job performance in forty one percent approve that gets closer among likely voters where it's a forty nine forty eight\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas look at it this way try this on for such\nA a Donald\nTrump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right and it's dominating your life just like ... was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump\nHas a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nYou're like ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh can we talk about today and I don't want to talk about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life Ted Cruz", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "17"}
