radio six Ninety K DSM\nTerrific how's it going good it's always good to talk to you I'm ... I Want to talk to you about a couple of things first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas\nUh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWell this may be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here is what we don't know and and that is is it safe front running of what the overall vote will be or\nIs it a massive way vote or or your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a national records are not just or mid term elections which is what the stairs up but in many of these locations are the first day of voting X\nOr the amount of those that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are vote will do his part but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan lets him up here and we want to make sure that people are subject to stop it but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas if you care about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines\nThis election where because there are other people out there\nWho were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your value must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this\nNeed to make sure you go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said yeah that's the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this is a game changing\nA ... a election is it not\nWhile he captured the as soon as very correctly because it used to be here in Texas and maybe some other places are the Democrats are either ran under no label or they would call themselves a\nConservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a is an out and now he says he is a\nSocialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism if not even further to the lab and the same thing is happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies\nThat is socialism or with a look at the uh wealth distribution policy that is socialism handle these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue there's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a Lynch pain here and ah the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped\nMillions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing and so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars or directly to candidates\nIn Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that has funded these ground games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for Canada's like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities and blue counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have all that and you have to El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people are who are Republican to be able

I think you should all the host these things you are innocent until proven yet is diamond charges against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every day up which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man that ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them right um so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to handle it why innocent until proven guilty\nIt's a thing or and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also ... and I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism about seventies relationships break up and there's things said and who knows\nThere's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about what capital and everyone you know half the country believes Cavanaugh I should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to keep up with a they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations\nWhat's fascinating is the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happen latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six\nHe's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the time\nAnd he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy dated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses there's Dr reports\nAt the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt the Democratic party like she'd rather have Allison on another Democrat when she doesn't right if I Want it to him for I mean it's just crazy\nYeah it's an amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for the post they thought they had that wrapped up a instead it's forty three thirty six so right now do we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go ah there's a if you're looking at\nRight now a forty a four feet are that are\nSafe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a few it's forty six excuse me forty effect if you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races that includes a Tennessee which is\nBuilt very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burn and then in Texas is still leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer but then you get a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're going to be at fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can pull off fix them six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things passed a so\nYou know at that level of whether it's a him and they could still lose it to they could easily still lose it impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nThe election by numbers\nOn the waiting for a pro October twenty third that's is that going back program\nAll right what I Would take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know well you know that which is er out putting ...

a play and the app store but it's a twenty first century version of Drudge Report it is for conservative video content\nUm that's out there that's being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on what do you what do you mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else\nWell what we're trying to do is I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some running and conservative content so we said\nYou know we can find all these great conservative publishers and say hey here's what we want to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is I'm a sort of the first step to be able to counter that suppression from YouTube and Facebook so who do you have on board so far so we have a conservative review we've talked a bright bar we had a great meeting with Prager you last week\nThey're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view ... to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your contest\nSo what do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um uh it is um [noise] uh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall or in many different directions a so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who is trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices\nWhat do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be able if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this as a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the ...\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going you\nKnow they can't sell that we can sell the libertarians two ... two older than you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there is a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think is the time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um an does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who can go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo you're the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you 'cause you know you've consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\nBut do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no way\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat ... so you know I talked to a lot of guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but
