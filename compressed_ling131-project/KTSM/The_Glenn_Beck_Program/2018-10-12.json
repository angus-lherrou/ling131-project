photos or they just tore her down for colonialism and all this crap\nErroneous I Know uh and then here she is where the hang on the most beautiful woman in the oval office with the with the greatest style since Jackie oh they love Camelot and her style she was on the cover of every fashion magazine\nBut no fashion magazine we'll put millennia Trump\nOn you know of course she couldn't go out\nTo their cocktail parties and all that it it it there you do your commentary on the political correctness the eight percent but back in ... you left out some really big things could never have happened without the ... in support of the media\nYes I play the media in at eight percent directors\n... let me just tell you a quick story okay All right so this week I've been doing a lot of a promotion for killing the ss which came out on Tuesday\nAnd in that promotion I'm basically saying\nThat we in America are seeing a rise of hate an evil and I tie it in a number of ways one of the ways that are tied it in was that George Soros at his crew have bought up about twenty packs political action committees\nAnd they sent they send them out on missions and one of those missions was\nSenator Flake in the elevator with the CNN camera right behind a woman's screaming at him a because she was a victim of something\nAnd he was an idiot for not the siding with her who's the woman the woman is an activist and a Soros pack making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year All right so I tell that story which is a tire early accurate a hundred percent correct and media matters within a half an hour says that I compared the woman to the third Reich\nOkay\nNow that's what's going on here that that's what's in play so the eight percent progressive zealots fanatics couldn't never\nHaving pose any thing on this country without the media taking up their cause and actually doing the dirty work\nI put the media in that eight percent it's the it is the reason why it has swept the country it is you're right because of the media but they are\nPart of that eight percent\nLook what happened to Kanye West my favorite guy of all time [laughter]\nOkay yeah so Kanye West who I I I

huh it's it's amazing how these people just disappeared\nEarly in the day and it's been through a long time going back and forth with Fox with lawyers trying to figure out where it's going to go forward what was going to happen and we we came upon an idea that we're in a separate oh separating from Fox they said the amicably separating bowling and Fox are amicably\nSeparating um and I looked at it on that day as a\nAs a new beginning and go start and go find another job somewhere and life is going to be great and you're going to sue\nI didn't know what it was going to do clean I I Will tell you that I ate whatever\nWas written about me was false patently false huh it was a lie it never happened in ... no one has ever ever come forward it was all anonymous sourcing\nBig long story short my lawyer said it's probably time to just cut ties with Fox and move on and go find another job is could this coupon forever and ... like there was going to be my family is going to be dragged through the mud for a long time so I decided that that was the thing to do we cut ties around three o'clock in the afternoon it was a friday before long weekend\nFor Labor Day uh I took my wife out to

continues today in states slam by hurricane Michael entire communities have been decimated in some areas and the death toll is on the rise\nYou are explain who you are [noise]\nI I think you know we have a slightly different way of doing things uh than what you were probably typically here in conservative talk radio a wine is we're mindful of the things we're actually trying to conserve is kind of nowadays conservative means I'm not a communist\n[laughter] are you living with pat when you say the second best one hears it is a a pet it's he's number one and in space by our space butter space by your number two [laughter]\nHow moving why this is why he is a genius [laughter] do you\nKnow we actually talked about the things we're trying to conserve the values and virtues that made America exceptional and where they came from in the first place it we we like to start arguments even more than we like to win them [noise] ah because we think that\nOne of the big problems in our country you know there's this idea that we're really divided in were arguing all the time 'cause we're not argument at all\nWhat we're doing is we're grabbing Seventeen burner accounts on social media calling each other anonymous names\nAre returning to the uh uh the ... factory uh of of the the smell that we prefer of our own tribe and uh and didn't never retreat from our own native sweat lodge convinced for right about absolutely everything over lobbing verbal bombs and our neighbor over there and we never talk to and we're calling that an argument okay\nI I actually think we need some real arguments we actually need to have both sides come out\nOr you know I kind of I I think the truth is its own reward and the truth is our friend and I am perfectly fine having a truthful conversation with people on the other side\nSo can you have good because I've I've started having them myself I'm a doctor or a Denver so ah in Studio this weekend or this last week\nUm we had Dave Ruben who else a stew here recently Michael reckon walled that Michael record all this guy who used to write for the communist newsletter and we don't agree on everything mhm but I'm looking for the people who you can't have a conversation with somebody\nWho is who's goal it is to say rights apply to certain people right and not to others is there isn't there a there is a line of who you can have a Congress areas\nAnd you know we try to equip our audience to see some of those lines and I think we need to understand to distinctions in our culture today gentleman we need to understand that distinction between an opponent and enemy\nAnd liberal and a leftist an opponent is someone who disagrees with you maybe even Vietnam and will do whatever they can within the boundaries of the of you know what's acceptable in terms of cultural warfare to defeat your ideas and the arena of ideas in enemy is somebody who wants to end you\nAn enemy of somebody has no interest in sharing a neighborhood with you sharing a school with you literally game with you or an office building with you uh and then you look at what's the difference between a liberal and the left is that you know a liberal is somebody that wants the government to permit you to do things God says are immoral and dumb\nThis is somebody that wants to government to compel you to do those things\nAnd if you will not do those things that God's says or immoral and dumb than us Eric Harris and likes to say you will be made to care the full course of power of government will be brought down upon me ah because you it it's you know resistance as few tile and you're watching this existential transition happening on the left in our culture\nAnd we're we're we're there aren't really too many liberals anymore and the reason why you're struggling to find people to have these conversations with in the media arena where we work is there's not too many of them left\nI think there are though outside\nOutside of the media Rena I agree that there are you know I see\nPeople people think that I Want to have conversations with you know I Want to your you're going to bring in so and so and they're going to have a conversation with them you can't talk to them no Nancy Pelosi I Can't\nTalk ... she has no interest in his ... he wants to end you want to share country with\nA ... it's the best thing is is that you could possibly say the most charitable thing on both sides is they just want to win ... so they'll do anything to win and some of them will go so far as when they leave the room go that guy's got to be stopped um and that's a dangerous but that's not who I'm Talking about\nNot I talk about my mom a lot because she had me at Fifteen share pregnant with me at fourteen she found out she was pregnant with me Christmas break Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd roe v Wade happens a month later and she decides not to have an abortion\nAnd so my mom and I literally grew up together and you know I become this Alex ... cheating wannabe kid in the eighties and she's your typical single mom government should do for people that they can't do for themselves you know and and and ... and has a different view of politics than me and for many years we couldn't talk about politics\nAnd so as I started growing more and conservative media we disagreed with and bring it up when we got together as a family has gotten away everything funny things happened the last few years though guys she is bringing it up now to me\nAnd she's semi retired now because of medical disability and so she watched a lot of what's on your screens I don't watch any cable news at all\nAnd I ... I Can't I Can't ... do you watch them never except when I'm On the air that yeah yeah for I mean yeah it unless it's ...\nHang on just a second I Want the audience to know that's unheard of in our business that you could not have done this job agreed without watching cable news you know three years ago\nRight and I mean I keep up on clips that go violence ... me too long form it's just toxic ingestion in the ... yeah yeah my mom watches a lot more of that she actually likes your show quite a bit actually and he's a brilliant but one of the things she\nCame to me one day before the twenty twelve election and she brought it up she started bringing politics that to me um you know unprovoked and she said you know I was so happy when rock Obama won in a way that we had shattered the racial ceiling and out of the blue she said to me she goes I I Wonder sometimes when I watch the things he says and he does that he's actually a communist [laughter]\nLet me away while I'm and I watched the way you know my mom is one of those people that is fine Weiss Obamacare\nThinks that Medicare for all his okay we need to be provided things like health care for ... she's not find with if you don't change your religion for the government we shut you down and put you in jail and she's not fine if we we get five hundred million dollars a year your money to Planned Parenthood so he's not find with\n... so I've I've recently come to this feeling that we have caused problems of communication\nBecause we have seen Obamacare and we know what the we know those who designed it we know they want single payer health care K we know that they are socialist that are ... drawing this up\nBut the people who like your mom and the regular people on the on the liberal side on the Democratic side\nThey're not for communism they're not for the end of capitalism they just believe in more welfare they just believe in a bigger hand to help\nAnd so when we say this is socialism they hear that as you're a communist and they're like communists right and so we have we have put a giant blanket over the entire voting public of Democrats\nAnd made them feel like we're calling them communists they don't feel like they're communist and they're not communist but it is provide that cover has provided cover if you will for the actual Marxist communists that are that are trying to say and of capitalism\nWhen when you look at you know for the last twenty five years I've been involved in full time a political advocacy either as a host or an activist or I worked on numerous campaigns are run the gamut I've done everything in our movement other than run for office basically myself\nAnd I'm ... when you look at the for the last for all the course of our careers that GOP consultancy industry has has designed a strategy to chase a voter that does not exist and this is filtered down into the talking points we in conservative media get from these people\nAnd that is that the average GOP consultant believed America wants on wants limited government like the Koch brothers and Saddam and Gomorrah at the same time\nIt actually totally in reverse the majority of ... and you know it's fascinating is Putin a huge study on this\nBreaking it down into twenty sixteen electorate at the the libertarian myth of the libertarian voter minutes how they define them that that voter largely does not exist as a unicorn okay the reality is and I've seen this on every GOP campaign for every candidate from state house to president I've ever worked on\nThe amount of pushback we get on our social beliefs compared to your the party of big business who wants to leave me off and doesn't care about me guys tend to one at minimum it's not\nEven close and then the reality is most voters are in favor of bigger government with better moral values and this is the secret sauce that Trump tapped into in the last election the irony is that the ultimate heat and dust\nAbsolutely embraces all of these cultural flashpoints he didn't say he didn't give you the token I'm pro life he stood up in front of a hundred million people at the presidential debate and said I'm going to appoint justices that will overturn roe [laughter] okay\nIt's very bad just telling you to come down to drill\nDown to you or you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue in Kenya to open a rabid
