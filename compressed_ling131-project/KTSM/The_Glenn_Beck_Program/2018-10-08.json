World War two that\nThis is the this is the system that they would have dreamt of for propaganda\n[noise] [noise] oh and this goes beyond their wildest dreams or because it's not just the search results I just published a big article\nA called a can of ways big tech can shift millions of votes in the November elections without anyone knowing now what the one we're talking about which is called the search engine manipulation of factors seem sci me\nThat's just one of ten ways uh that I've identified over the years in that I've been studying I'm studying seven of them at the moment ah that these big tech companies have to shift votes and that are unprecedented in human history they've never existed before uh and\nThey they they're I mean some of these the effects that that that I've discovered are among the biggest ever discovered in the behavioral sciences\nAnd they're ... years\nAnd there is no doubt in your mind that Google is engaging in this\n[noise] well in two thousand sixteen early two thousand sixteen uh working in secret\nUh I developed a system for actually monitoring what\nPeople were seeing while they were using the Google bang and Yahoo search engines that was election related so it's as if we were looking over people's shoulders it's called the monitoring system itself was a first ever\nCreated and so we actually monitor for more than five months before the election in November two thousand sixteen [noise]\nUh and we found a systematic bias in search results favoring Hillary Clinton whom I favored by the way as you mention\nA in all can search positions on the first page of search results now that's that's pretty late and that's pretty extreme flowers these leaks these leaks that we've seen recently from Google\nA you know they're they're they tell us you know that yeah people at Google will have a very strong political preferences and that they act on them and uh I don't think we should be surprised\nThat we found that and of course now I'm working with with business partners in academic colleagues on three continents to try to scale up monitoring systems like that so for the first time actually\nBe able to see what these companies are showing people all throughout the U.S and ultimately throughout the world and will will I think be able to make these companies accountable to the public at some point uh you know Irish we well I Wish we could be fully up and running\nAnd time for the midterms and uh at this point I'd say that's not going to happen but\nWe will definitely be there for for twenty twenty and beyond and and we're looking at more than elections because it's there there are lots of ways in which these companies are playing with us\nOr that people are just completely unaware of and speaking of which\nGlenn nobody trouble [laughter] ...\nKind of yeah it's kind of um I have a good news and bad news for you\nOkay I'm who's ... hey [laughter] All right\nLet's let's say that are a very good the good and the good news\nI mean the the good news is that um\nThat Glenn Beck dot com right yeah and your email service that you use a ... is is you are not sharing information you're sharing your emails with Google Now interesting left in New York Times\nThe times of London the economist wired magazine slate I could go on and on and on base share all of their\nEmails all the time with the Google and other sensitive documents too and so reporter is when they're doing you know very sensitive investigations on something they're sharing everything constantly with Google and I wrote a piece about that\nWas in the Daily Caller a couple of months ago good news is you don't do that\nYou're okay let's end it there for ...

people who claim that that these big\nTech companies and stuff have biases and I think that there's some evidence that they do um you know but I think a lot of people are motivated by politics when they making lanes like that and we've seen a lot of I think that's true in a lot of cases\nUm you know the fact that Hillary Clinton supporter would do a test of the two thousand sixteen election and find the results that shocking is really a major thing this is the you know he went through an actual process here this is not just some guy it's not just some blogger who thinks\nThey've known in all this is like a lot of it as a leader in in in psychology yeah this I mean he was the head of Psychology Today these are the head of a couple of ah research centers it's Harvard I mean this guy isn't that the real\nDeal with some real credibility comes from the left part of it because he comes out it kind of from the moderate to se describing Hillary and voter right right um but beyond that uh\n... seems incredibly hopeless\nTo me to stop it I mean just you know because we talk about this all the time how do we move how do we how do we convince people how to persuade people to look at the world in a slightly different way or at least challenge their beliefs you know someone who might be a all long term you know left wing voter why wouldn't they consider a conservative approach right\nAh and we talk about that stuff all the time\nBut I Know that I can easily supporter you know a candidate that I like right like I can vote my principles easily because I just do it right it but it's harder to make other people change with the Google thing I don't know even how in my life I Would be able to on my wine myself from Google I I honestly have no idea how I Would do that\nAnd I'm In I'm not even use an Android so I mean so if you're in an Android which is the largest operating as you know a platform used shocked by how clear he was on that no yeah it was like you're nuts if you're using any of those\nYeah he's like do not use any go a Google device yeah not use them I mean he's like it is a what did he say a surveillance\nApparatus only\nYeah ... yeah it's like a designed to just watch you all the time I mean you know Gmail or you know people use Gmail all the time it's you know and one of the reasons they do is it's the best what\nRight like this is a problem because the the part of the reason why it's the best one is because they're taking all this information and using it to make their products better which is how they would of course argue that they're using it but I mean it actually does work right\nUm you know uh the search engine obviously we all know Google is is the best one chrome is the best browser\nIt is it's better than the other ones I've ever used as it's been a you know I'm ... I mean you know it's you get into deep stuff and you but I don't even know how to unwind myself from the basics there how it would even do it not to mention the stuff that you know what you talked about with um certain browsers or use other uh you know at all apple products right use Google\nFor the injured search and it's a you know in safari well even if I'm not using chrome I'm Still using Google yeah we talked about in a lot of every time we talk about this someone will will say hey what about duct duct go duck duck goes a a a competitor to Google that ... that you know ... prioritizes privacy and it seems to be a good company with the right sort of principle\nUm and when it comes to the sort of stuff but I was like you know maybe I should start using it and I went to duck to go and they said you shouldn't do this on your chrome browser crap what the hell is going to make the difference if I'm searching for all this stuff in duct duct go on chrome\nSo now I've got ...
