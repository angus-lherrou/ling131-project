I'm going all full I I've just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out both teams but let's let let ... how ...\nFrom here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans since it's a tribe to trial it does the\nI mean there are studies that show that the average ... percent of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he ... I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show\nThey show any DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not getting participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test the DNA against we have to use\nPeople from ... New Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well way\nAnd there's the the theory is that they those the same people want it migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she has Native American blood and it's not even what they tested\nA and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you if you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed in like to point out over the years\nHe would not show the his Canadian blood right like that's not the way this works they oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian somewhat DNA does is it shows the lineage of game shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns and\nI Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's a thousand times more Hispanic than a prominent friends disorder or it's true it probably would show that uh but so it's\nInteresting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um\nIt was a her great great great great grandmother I think a several generations back and um when she register who's in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the war in a campaign and and and and this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there was a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you could get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right here and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nOne obviously why that is true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with ... her great great great great great great grandmother secondarily yeah but\nWhat have we learned from progressive we've learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she is not that was what I was not allowed to apply to any\nMoney we can't do that to her but Elizabeth Warren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is so we can't accept\nLook what what are great great great grandmother identified\nI Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter I mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either don't care that she's lighting and the people you know she's lying or let me just play looking I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them or I Want one more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family okay of ah one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather actually took a horse of being a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he took him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock the horse out okay\nSo in my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't have okay\nNow the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather or was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept\nA jumping over and getting into his garden or whatever I don't even want to do this and he picked it up and threw it over the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go in and say it's not ... ... my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true\nOh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing ya oh yeah this\nIs what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls when I was her\nI almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never you you've\nYou've yeah yeah yeah I get it I again if she is ... trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why it is I can give you that I got what it's about it I give you that I found a huge story I mean ... you know we\nWell you know what is a huge part of the story is the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage such as return ally to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal air at the edge\nOkay look not a good look yeah they're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her or she should probably\nZip it and it does this not go on this whole saga of the last few days when the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning signs to Democrats to not nominate her this is\nA oh no no no no I look I Want to know\nThis is this is a science show she's ... years of really really she yeah she's great she's great she'll get the the

smashed ... pretentious manifesto nail to the door that says that we put the Republicans on notice a this is only the beginning we are not civil which by the way the Hillary quote\nA then I get to the venue that night for the next night total in outer chaos because we made signed screaming hurling\nSo you're in which one of them hit my car on the way out a ... ... organized rallies like there's this kind of met that you'll see if you really get deeper into the foxhole where he is calling in the front thing you know you guys go over there over there I citizen journalists get beat up\nThey take his backpack their police to arrest him and then\nThey they arrest the citizen journalist\n... known outside interests three of the of the end who mob this guy okay but I had\nI interviewed him today and he was talking about coordinated attacks seemed very military so this isn't anarchy these anarchist start pulling off\nWell you you know I I don't know I'm sure you are\nUm and to FAA Austin is a ... on their Facebook page has called for a guerrilla style tactics they've they've called for a what do they call it a black shirt army or something I read a a red shirt army I Can't remember 'em but they're calling for\nPeople that just want to go out and do what ... normally does but they're also calling now for a an actual standing army\nAnd they were looking for people that know military tactics that could teach people so that's that's happening and of course Facebook doesn't have a problem with with covering that but\n... must be the Mets had guy that police are looking for that my citizen journalists told me about 'em so yeah that those guys were charged with assault and robbery because they took his backpack\nSo now you know when I by the way peaceful amount of Martin Luther king guy mock right there I saw the same experience right up till now and it's been days and then when it's time to leave\nCome out there I've got my plastic sword I make a choice which new joke and that's when they hurl the Internet may I jump in the car and then a\nGroup of Proud Boys are are the last wants to go they they leave and the video just came out yesterday on breaking nine one one on Twitter they were attacked by antifa fully clad\nAll their gear and they throw a bottle at them and a huge fight breaks out and now in your world that fight would have been you know\nHey cops cops or something like that and then I'll come actual it's a little bit longer but again five to ten seconds different so we're splitting hairs here you know the real issue as we're up against\nHomicidal lunatics with no gender plan and it's not like they know where we're going to get you know our our gas and oil from after the revolution these guys just want to burn America to the ground and the media is on their side you know\nSo it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon and ah you know Portland has I I don't know who this mayor is what I mean what the hell is he doing\nWhere that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away and then they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens with someone who likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are out so well that's just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh that's their sort of Monaco and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from ... throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at least ... the main one that has been covered it was not something that you guys instigated\n[noise] and it's strange how quick the media is to run with the evil Nazi narrative without doing any research whatsoever and isn't it strange to how the media ticks five second clip and makes that\nThe total story when we have days and days and days or some subterfuge stays in the domestic violence it's almost like I'm at I'm at a point now where I think they don't just like ... they are and she thought\nI think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies if masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I ah I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating uh on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the violence on the streets and the calls for kick them when they're down in all of this stuff\nAre you there is no excuse when when when the when they will not Cole a mob mob an angry mob when everybody knows what that means I I don't know what I I don't know what to say I mean how\nDo you and I can't go to restaurants Tucker Carlson just today said he can't go to restaurants and no one and only when conservative can go to a restaurant today that's a new one\nAnd it's because the the media will throw around a white supremacist like it it means absolutely nothing oh it's a crime is this is someone who sees

at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is a military and is it when you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil what\nWe expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate\nA risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time what is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change\nIn constitution\nAnd it is not clear how he would do it he has a suggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil and\nThat would be submitted to a vote for ah after eight so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so it he had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it\nBack once he takes office because the fact is that he's not going to debate he is giving I'm just\nA few interviews and usually he controls the process it has been speaking mainly through social media\nSo he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming\nBut analyst most analysts\nDon't expect something so drastic at right at the time including because uh in the legislative elections he got a a strong a performance in ... from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governors melody and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends to but we still don't know exactly what\nWhat do those changes come it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\nOr that ... son it ...\nAnd he posted online a while back a photo of him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon\nAs said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved the end was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy\nBut a boat so NATO himself a came to public\nAfterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact\nIs that Bannon has given some indications that he considers a ... an expression of this right wing movement that with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this\nDirection and both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's get a presidential candidates an a and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nI'm Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nAre now at the end of the month a ... on Sunday twenty eighth\nOr will have the final result it's very likely that considering the current polls that bill sonata we'll be elected\nUh we uh yesterday we had a recent poll that gave both so NATO fifty nine percent of valid votes and set it into a dodge it that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to our ferry sure\nOf their votes so we we would have to have a a new fact something that would be strong enough to change the scenario button\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out uh some more will be falling out hey thank you so much for appreciated okay thank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um of dictatorship a love and passion and ah he is not\nA Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's a change demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator you know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator he came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that is we should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is\nA helping cobble together this a populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely

game that's been talked about this Saudi Arabia\nThing because right now Congress is saying we want to slap major sanctions on them\nOkay I'm you know where we're at a point to where uh I said you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not

shut down the Texas oil reserves were I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a a spike a severe spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapse the last time in two thousand eight was a spike to a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel\nYou also have turkey this is coming from turkey and it stunned bowl um turkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening\nEconomically the Saudi royal uh funds are\nBig in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons why our stock market\nIs taking a hit at least in the tech sector because they think if it goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore and you know where are they going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money\nOr from the Saudis it was easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that that you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check on um uh on Iran\nIf they are weakened if\nUh they are a weekend in the area not
