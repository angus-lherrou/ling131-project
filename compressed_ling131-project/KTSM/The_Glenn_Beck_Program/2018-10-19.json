automatically added to the library's them all I tuned users\nAround the world saying the move was a drop of megalomaniac and a touch of generosity I tuned users complain that the eleventh songs have been added to their music library without permission and that it was not clear how to delete them\nI was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out or it out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people and here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and you get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just\nYou're trusting your children to\nWho knows what ... where's the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's got to be some\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case to left would make on their behalf would be a you know things are so bad so bad in Honduras\nGuatemala I mean they can get a lot worse you can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong\nYou talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite a lot to say that we talked about this yesterday\nI you know letting my kid walk who step and walking the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block it there there's there's a giant pond there in a green area it's a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said hey\nBut I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond\nLike alone [laughter]\nWithout your brother [laughter]\n\nYou stop and think about how you know pretty protective ... yeah exactly I I don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras and it was a group of people that I don't know [laughter] ... outlook\nThere are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there are certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people\nIn these situations are like this or is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to\nIt's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone has a four year old who came across the border and in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old\nThat this is a different it's a different story a and\nYou just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that ... when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this ... you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it or you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like a thousand people are not qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion\nRight if it feels like wait us they're just ... like the top of the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security\nThere there you're coming in or the right way or the overriding security\nAnd you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location\nSo they can let them into Mexico and say well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this\nAnd yet or\nThe vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a fairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful\nA war on carrying were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy\nOf course if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they work\nIf somebody do that without permission with ... with them back then\nThey ... they send back them they then back to them if they do it without permissions they send back to them but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society\nThey are of economic and social benefit to society weight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being\nOf the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding writes\nA that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even do can interfere in their in internal politics plus if they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's a [noise]\nA blatantly racist right I mean like that is not there's not an argument there we would never know you can't do that you know you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still Seventy or eighty percent yeah I mean I think I Would you I wouldn't I Can't I Can't think\nOf one Trump supporter who would have a ... a support a policy where we had to keep the exact same percentages of white people versus other races you what you want to people who are productive who are here because they want to be here and be part of the society\nOr going to add something to our community instead of taking things from it I mean right now that is what you want the hypocrisy is mind by that really is incredible\nLying to buy it really is it ... ... security for me but not for me and that is not a a that is not a that's incredible I mean that's an incredible [laughter] it is a line there that they draw it is a you know it's not it's not the right thing and and it and it's\nPolitically wanting to flip the bottom line is we're we have a lot of illegal immigrants here there will be more that are coming we need to tighten up that is a completely let the larger argument that needs to be addressed and we've been talking about it for years and years\nBut politically speaking you got three weeks to a mid term election there's no like this is a complete gift to the Republicans\nTo people who care about the border to people who have any uh did Donald Trump and the people he's supporting ice the gift\nIt is and and he's telling Republicans that saying hey used then use it in the ... election campaign start talking about immigration 'cause I haven't heard\nAny of them doing that are any other Republican candidates using immigration not that I've heard I mean maybe some warm someone somewhere is but it doesn't seem to be a general theme for the\nParty I did hear cut all talking about it in the debate or I don't think I don't know that you mentioned the caravan per se but I mean he was talking a lot about border security I mean there's a really close race in Arizona a race or where I'm at Sally has a I think a great chance of winning\nOr people because her opponent there is like if you took a Michael Moore and put him in his\nBrain into a female body of a congresswoman\nYou would have all of these tapes that they've been finding about her where she saying you know she's bashing Arizona oh young if the lab of democracy she's saying people are crazy in Arizona she's talking about how I mean she's on nine eleven truth or shows I mean she is\nAs it's incredible but they decided to run her and just and thought that this stuff would not come out\nAnd and ... you know you're talking about a ... uh one of the first female pilots in history and the ... of the air force incredibly accomplished yeah has a great chance of winning in a in a tough environment or in Arizona adding on this situation where\nAre you know you're you basically have a coat pink worker a code pink staffer is running for Senate in Arizona and it\nWas a huge mistake I think for her to be their number they really with cold picker denied any time that the rising her views I don't know exactly she yeah she's been with a lot of these uh left wing extreme groups or some maize any early to thousands to the point where again\nLike she like co hosted a show with someone who is the nine eleven truther Wilder awhile\nThat's like it's crazy bonkers over the line right and and you find that you have a really solid candidate there in Arizona and its border state the big deal there Texas is another one the cruise cruise has got to lead there but I mean he's always been talking about border security but\nYeah I get a look at the other side of that yeah that's how\nHe doesn't want no all he doesn't I I don't know that even wants to border frankly now it just seemed like it and he's made a big deal out of it some of those ads are like let's protect the dreamers\n... this week in Asia box office

El Paso and all of a sudden the talent mckell and this is all over Texas yeah it is apparently what's true here yeah um and and I one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIs it true that there is no example of someone named Robert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named uh what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert and people call you Gilbert\nApparently tobacco you did not exist you are not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence that you exist so if you happen to be a Robert\nAn Albert Gilbert or an embarrassing\nBaritone and obviously you're probably going to have a Hispanic ... right that's kind of a Hispanic man I Would probably better so yeah I Would I don't know what you would shorten too except maybe that's how I guess I I don't I don't know any um people who are not Hispanic yeah who are named\n... and and this is an opportunity for us a pet and do a two white white white ... we're talking Whitey Whitey to the ... the

ah some Hispanic culture here over the past few months\nBut I Would like to know from people who actually grew up in these areas is it true that every one I'm sure there are some examples I can think of one off the top of my head whose name Robert Francis or any calls himself Beto but is there is this a common thing to the point of\nI Believe his standard was everyone who gets ... named one of

close the border by sending the national guard down in an effort to prevent them from entering the country\nYou got to see a pattern and have their little been Republican slightly out raising them they're kind of changes in two thousand six where it goes to fifty percent Democrat than fifty six percent Democrat in two thousand eight that's brought up on his first election\nUh it's been hanging around a fifty percent ever since two thousand ten was forty eight percent doesn't twelve forty four percent doesn't fourteen forty seven percent doesn't sixteen fifty percent she get that there's a range there from about forty three to fifty six percent that is broken and fifty six was outlier most of the time is right between forty seven fifty fifty one\nSo far in ... in two thousand Eighteen Democrats have raised sixty five percent of the money going to the house wow again they've never been higher than fifty six sixty five percent a sixty five thirty five split against Republicans\nThey are out there was a congressman who came up the other day he raised eight hundred thousand dollars in his district\nHe did a good job his opponent announced two point six million shoes and this is like it's unheard of when it comes to money and the disparity going on now\nNow we're ... the Democrats are favored to take the house I don't know how much it has to do with money\nBut if they were to lose this race with these ... with this sort of a climate it would be not complete destruction\nOf any argument that money can buy elections I mean this is they're they're gonna complain I mean that was on stage complaining with Ted Cruz about money and how Ted Cruz is influenced by your you got to write me a hundred thousand dollar donation to him like I like this is a big a big deal in today's world um\nBut I mean he's he's raised this wasn't even close Beto he's thirty eight million dollars more than any Senate candidates himself is in history yeah for a quarter or which is incredible you said it was compared to ... racing and what's your what he wants\nMore in the in the uh if you compare quarter last quarter of the campaign in two thousand eight he raised more than ... Obama during his presidential\nCampaign that that's a presidential election emphasizing this is the Texas Senate ... Senate race where he barely have any chance to win uh-huh\nNow it's funny in the Senate race record he broke\nWas the what was the ... record set by Rick lousy oh of course you remember senator lousy oh from New York running a children's Hillary he did not win that race was not a close race\nEven though Rick lousy it wasn't a bad candidate it was kind of a close race it was Hillary right in New York [noise] expect her to win again ear to ear around fifty in almost every it's almost a fifty fifty split every year and this you're sixty five thirty five that's a big issue is\nUm and the other thing that's kind of interesting on the in the bad side if you want to get scare mongering for awhile and why not cleanse out we haven't had enough scare mongering lately um we haven't set it always ends with a bullet to the head all we all week on well now in the last two days with knowing how we just you know we have a\nGoing back in history looking at two hundred and thirty eight seats with a democratic incumbent only eight percent of them are getting knocked off when you have a democratic incumbent running for Republicans the ... the rate is twice as high sixteen percent now is that a big difference I mean sixteen percent it's still not high\nBut it does show that Republicans wind up losing these incumbency races a little bit more often if you're worried about\nThe Senate there's a little bit of there's a little bit of something there to be worried about I think they're going to win the Senate I think you're in a sea of fifty three or fifty four seat majority I think they may pick up a couple of said oh I'm I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Arizona I'm I'm pretty bullish right now in Texas are those who were in question\nOf I ... I I think to winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit\nI think there's a chance for that um\nI wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten ... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah uh Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida and ... mindset Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top and something like ... yeah ... I saw it's close but um they pretty much a separate but\nThose other I mean Florida is a complete toss no reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do away for junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nThink Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that that isn't brand they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican thing about this you complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer\nCold Lisa Murkowski Joe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch\nMcConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for a Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because Democrats are now communist again or social listening communists yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and by the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and Mick Sally is running for a well\nHe votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah you know again ... West Virginia is a state is probably the most pro Trump state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it was bizarre they would go for I mean I imagine it's got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capital almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota but I mean in in\nWest Virginia it got mentioned you got his cabinet vote you have a couple of but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls it is an interesting development there\nUh but uh it is a winnable it should be winnable seat in this environment uh right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mentioned seat you're you're at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one\nIt would be a real surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there is a good you know eighty percent chance that there are the most models that are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota uh she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my seat\nThere I think honestly you had two races decided by the cabinet vote one was mansion job was high and high camp her vote against that field I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race though\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it I think she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said that double digits situation happens there yeah look\nAgain North Dakota as a conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well we've got this one Democrat this is when we got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances with the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and\nAll of these far left figures and good for North Dakota in ... for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah yeah there's some uh optimistic\nThings there but the dangers there as well I mean this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens is let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now\nWhich is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly\nYou lose it let's say by eight or ten or seats you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in certain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's going to be almost nothing they can get through\nAlmost nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which they'll find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it but other than that you're going to get any real advantage not going to need a tax stuff you're you're going to be tough times with any regulation you're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy\nAs long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bill through yeah just just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls that the last thing wrong well some of it they got right a and a lot of it they got rights including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually\nAnd to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know what this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing 'em there's a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats\nI mean who knows it could be I mean we don't know how many Republican hookers he has it could be on a high percentage we don't know we don't\nKnow [laughter] I find out but I think I\nGot to be interesting you're voting for someone who's who's dead and and the NFL self described him [laughter]\nOh yeah that was I mean it was that was the deal\nYeah Republican morals 'cause he's ... he's a Republican big a big he ... he ran one other time in almost won the last time and they have is actually going to win it looks like a\nUm I notice that you are still talking about Glenn and his canoe trip but I look for the go pro video online and\nDigital and detect the dark Web it's on the dark Web no yeah that's weird oh yeah oh\nUh it's interesting because we I just got an email here it says ah this is ... is doing pat I may be your only listener who's actually staring at the Mediterranean Sea\nAnd say listen [laughter]\nI can ... the Glen is nowhere to be seen rowing near and mountain the oh ... well that was his departure pulled that's where he left from there so he'd be a long way from there now yeah yeah you're not gonna be able to via\nOcean good to be there a while yesterday or the day before probably uh yeah they're yeah he'll be back on Monday though we think\nWell he's he he he's already done the canoe thing across the Mediterranean and now he has a he's climbing\nA K too as we speak and all that training is done is paying off man it's paying off it sure is and you can tell when you look at him also by the way I got a lot of us that work out like that now they are when you're you're ... you're put you guys in the same category\n[laughter] so do the effort [laughter]\nGood news good news coming I Know that ah you know everybody was concerned about a a carbon taxes but they're going to be here the Exxon Mobil is announced that they're going to give a million dollars to the Americans for carbon dividends and that means that uh the carbon carbon taxes on its way\nCan axon Exxon Mobil is doing this ... that are giving their unbelievable so why are they ... like\nThe ... now there's some belief that that actually caving they're just giving ... million to pretend like they're four and they're not really so so ... that's very possible\nThat was the lead to get people off their back and get nobody off your back they know disbelief then you're ... you're just re what ... you just said they were faking it yes I think ... you don't get the credit for this and of course you know it is an interesting thing\nWhen it comes to a new government regulation all these companies that go through and and what free enterprise when they're coming up in the world right when they get to be the biggest boys they lying some of these new taxes regularly do because it winds up punishing upstart are competitors\nYou know actually I can swallow a little bit of a stroke of regulation and not not deal with it and that's why I Googled writes things you know they're they're heavily involved in in a lot of the net neutrality stuff and I got her Google ... like they can take a little bit of a deal with it if the you know if the guy down who's starting up something new that winds up getting punished\nBut listen we all I think we all can agree that something has to be done because uh now what what we can not all of the things that they're going to try", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "19"}
