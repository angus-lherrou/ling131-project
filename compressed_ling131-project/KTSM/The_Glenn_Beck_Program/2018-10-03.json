right don't we still because we have somebody we have somebody who has accused her of teaching someone else\nAbout a polygraph\nWell she's innocent until proven accused I think that's important that we keep it any better she now that you moved accuse she is accused she's guilty so if we're going to use the same standards of the left is applying she is a lawyer\nShe has perjured herself\nCertainly shouldn't be a professor anymore she should not be offensive even be allowed to work at a fast food restaurant I think so how can you how can you possibly believe a liar on anything she says\nYou want this standard because this is the standard that's coming\nThis is the standard that we are now running to embrace this is the standard that our children this is the standard that we ran from this is why we're America because in every other country this was a new idea\nYou can always come into my house and just take me you can't just throw me in jail you have to have an accuser I have to know what the charges are I have a right to defend myself I have a right to know who my accuser is and address\nMy accuser\nI have a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty this is what America was

you are not under surreal law you're an infidel which means I can kill you I can rape you can turn you into a slave\nThat is\nWhat the war on terror is all about\nAnd we will never win it unless we name our enemy\nWe would have never won World War two if we were fighting the Germans we we're not fighting the Germans we were fighting the Nazis\nWe would not have one in the in the civil war had we been fighting the south\nWe were fighting people who didn't believe in the constitution we were fighting for the freedom\nOf all men that's why we won and by the way if you don't think that's true we lost every single battle up until the point\nThat Abraham Lincoln said this is about slavery\nLook it up\nWe wouldn't have won the the American Revolution\nIf it wasn't against tyranny it wasn't against the king it was against tyranny and it was for certain ideas like the idea\nThat you were innocent until proven guilty\n\nWe are fighting post modernism and until the American people understand what post modern ism is you will lose\nYou will lose every battle because you will only grow frustrated and angry which will play directly into what they want to happen\nThey want us at

own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China and the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concerns\nOr from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if these books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um\nThat dominate these markets then there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to uh to to uh to archive and preserved um these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they found it objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are a number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know that the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on so one way this can happen is that as you described\nUm the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or movie studio decide that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo hell home I Do [noise]\nUm oh my gosh so they almost a force you to I mean 'cause they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and uh you know fully restored but you still had the old copy now threat you can't ... I mean even for thinking this even just for comparison\nYou can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed our war on well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that\n[noise] that's right I mean and and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer did will have a local copy stored on their computer or their device\nUm and and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally many services are often trying to\nEncourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution and sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example\nAt the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of the movie you have to access it through\nTheir ... servers exactly I'm Sorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded of something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device but cars that Kendall is tethered through software right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block move those files strong\nMuslim ... ... you're talking about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years do chew and a very different way I I'm sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forced everybody to have it exactly\n[laughter] it's bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making for my tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they are constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change their cars that either but that's a real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break\nAnd then we'll come back and get you to answer that question a and just the\nChange in him capitalism change what does it mean to enter a world where\nThere's really no ownership of anything\nFor four years now relief factor has been helping uh my team here in the studio\nAlleviate pain late last year I'm old school mine well I Want to tell you about really factor really factor take it it's a really good [laughter]\nI'm married and you can buy really factor with gold one thing you can I don't think you can ...

the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yeah it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer ha ha ha and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film is saying is that Google or has and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and making money or they have a certain ... certain world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move a singer directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that\nRight yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWhat one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this was a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb I dunno Google it yes\nWell I'm from Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary that will always change the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's a real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about a ...\nA about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't like you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of us suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the the point that we try to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way fake news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news at that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted a different way that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because a confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people to Google and Facebook is why will you knock make your algorithm transparent right\nWhy will you know I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very good\nAt it not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com [noise] Peter ... with it and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from
