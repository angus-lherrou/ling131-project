will be an invasion\nBecause America can control our own borders\nNearly eight thousand troops to match up four thousand strong caravan fourteen thousand if the second caravan linked up with the first swelling their numbers just seven thousand\nSo any media magician trying just spin what this caravan really is\nAnd I honestly don't know how you can describe a potential force of seven thousand people all approaching your border with the intent of getting through no matter what you say and carrying a foreign flag I don't know what you call it besides an invasion\nSo it was the department of defense justified well the news media will say no but what does America say\nIt is classic mail is ... military style doctrine preparing now for an unconventional attack on the country that has not happened before\nBut I said I Want to be fair here unexpected in a regular tactics call for emergency action and I definitely feel safer knowing that men and women and green and blue or standing watch on the border\n\nI don't know what you can expect what should you do nothing\nNothing\nIf you had a group of people that were headed to your business or to your house and they said we're going to go into your house whether you like it or not\nAnd we've got two thousand people here\nAnd you're not going to be able to stop us because what's in your house we want we're just going to live there now if you had a group of people that were marching\nSaying that coming to your house\nWould you want the police to do nothing\nWould you think that would you be happy if the police all of a sudden just said you know watch their not common for you know here they are they're on the road there on the road there they are there's the video there's the video them saying they're going to come into my house

what's happening so far well uh we're one week away and this is one big it falls the with the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category I'm pulling spend close and now we start to\nTry and move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are down to only three tossup races\nUh we have moved uh Missouri\nAnd Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident us Indiana the polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz is still lean Republican state\nA ... and a ... a Mississippi and North Dakota is going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators say there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure toss up still and we couldn't really move them\nOr Arizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was you know some of them showing her up fourteen points plays falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race because you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen\nA movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one as a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well from safe Democrat to leaning Democrat pulling their you know\nI still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer than I think most people expect there's two races in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we moved to lean Democrat as well or was the tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point er and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin and leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three\nForty five for Democrats so I mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate that is a lot of\nStarting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction\nIs moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans are the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we see no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big hope for pick up again this is a state that voted for Trump by thirty points and Joe mansion I think he you know\nI think he's solidified his seat there with his pro cabin I'll vote yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's\nThat the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nervous we're moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now or it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back we're going to give us

and one way and then on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets us think of them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ... you out like the invasion of the body Snatchers\nThat this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work and those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know uh and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking this any more you see the ratings start to go down but now it's our time and now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do\nUm and that's what we're trying to do with red called America that's on the heart radio\nA pod cast a shooting I heart radio excuse me I hunt radio ...\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um\nLet me ask you I'm Patrick I'm I have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly that the that the business people looked at Megan Kelly inside while she's a great get she's she's very credible she's ready to interview you know we have our own\nKind of sixty minutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire and that's when the social justice warriors all around them\nRemind her remind them she's a conservative she was released she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um and no you can't play nice and you have to destroy her\nAnd so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it they did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy\nDo you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network for their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it it basically she was you know print brave and doing that\nI think you know from a career wise it might've been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet here's a woman in the me too moment exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to a\nMan and I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and it was easy to get rid of it because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened in egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red pills America you
