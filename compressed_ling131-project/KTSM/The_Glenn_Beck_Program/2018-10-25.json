a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the\nShrapnel was what's dangerous than a pipe bomb the explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter] right [noise]\nUm but there's another ingredient that they actually talked about

I\nGuess I've seen pictures of people in the military for example who are about to fire a missile and they put like Osama bin Laden name on it or something like I get the theoretically possible but if you know of bombs going to explode why would you put a sticker of a right wing me on the ... and less and less again\nPotentially a you've thought maybe they wouldn't blow up and that people would see the right wing meat\nYeah right like what's almost as if they put on the outside of the envelope open with care this is an explosive so that they wouldn't explode it's not one of the nine has gone off\nThey all look but they also put glass in instead of ball bearings or anything metal you walk metal as your as your shrapnel you you you wouldn't but glass in the bomb would just disintegrate the glass even more\n... you you you don't want it in PVC pipe you wanted in a metal pipe because of the shrapnel\nThis is just ... it's there's just too many things wrong with this and again it might just be somebody who was sick and demented ... and ... that was the end the stupid or it might be some kid that thought this would be funny it might be\nSome you know mentally deficient a right winger that did it it also may be somebody who was on the left is like oh I Know how to change the narrative could be that two of quaint don't know\nI mean you have to have some level of skepticism of the south of the of the obvious narrative here right a which is some right wing or did this I think the first thing that makes you leap to that is it's not they haven't exploded\nRight so if you are trying to harm someone usually you'd be able to do it okay the same thing applies I Believe two white powder arriving to the president whenever I hear that whenever right wing or figures are hit with a bunch of white powder in the mail my first thought is\nWell okay obviously you'd think if someone who was opposed to them but would take a ... minute here and consider that someone is trying to make the president or some other right wing figuring look like they're under attack especially when it turns out not to be right then and just white powder\nWide and someone do that well of course there should be skepticism we've had these these things have happened a hundred times unbelievably someone just listen to this I suppose he thinks the\nCommunist didn't set fire to the rice dog as well [laughter] I mean you of course take a moment to consider and and there's no reason to come to a conclusion because we have no idea at this point what you see these statement that have come out from CNN\nAnd ... you know people just outwardly blaming\nThe right and Donald Trump for this\nLook I don't we first of all you can't blame Donald Trump for the ... unless you think he actually was responsible does anyone think that he actually sent the bombs and brought them to George sources how well no but I think a virus that might have been [laughter] unless you think he's actually responsible irresponsible for your own actions we know that\nBut beyond that if you're going to you you have to look at this in some ... with some level\nOf skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that the the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now\nThat does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be there are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them are stupid

agency she is a pariah now\nShe's a pariah\nAnd people will say on the right good\nGood good\nPeople on the left will say good Megan\nKelly affected anyone's life\n\nWell she has made it very difficult for NBC to\nLive down their sexual harassment and assault that's been going around their offices\nShe keeps bringing that up\nShe was very serious and one of the biggest critics of NBC and the way they\nHandled some of those allegations seemingly they are really finding a a quick way\nBut it seems to me to me that maybe she has a target on her for some of those are things that she said\nWhich is kinda fascinating because that'd be the I mean as we know\nThat they're going to do you tell us talk to us constantly about the inequality between the sexes and and and how how those conservatives are really about Roy Moore oh he's a he's a bad guy or but we're going to find that when it comes to people like Matt Lauer and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's when one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it\nTo the New Yorker\nI I you know all that goes on and making Kelly happens to be one of the biggest critics of what happened and NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments there is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks there is no place on our air or in this work place\nFor those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I add to that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who take offense at the slightest\nThing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think\nThat it's the vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this is about maybe five to ten percent\nOf America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics and the last\nPlace probably the last comes first academia [laughter]\nYou should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not we're the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay\nIs she was she looks like a million address with a bomb it okay she she ... she also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\nYou know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wine she didn't cry about it she's like oh crap [noise] shouldn't around with that I poked my eye out and she moved on\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes things have changed\nWe're evolving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nKelly oughta know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what if it's a costume that his\nPurpose flea ridden a ridiculing race\nAs black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be but notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words\nAnd I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why why is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people why is this wrong with\nThat person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume\nWhy is this wrong\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't beat me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me\nHow are we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nThe criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist\nIf she doesn't\nWell we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nAnd this is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thoughts crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four\nHere's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't thought of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crimes stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter\nAnd here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say

now on the left\nPointing that out that we're calling for an end of capitalism I mean we've gone we've gone further than just saying yeah were you know where socialist like Canadians no no they're now
