I'd like them to come back against that ... that is why they see it as kind of sense to me\nAnd I may I may not be there and ask you for clarification swimming\nI think and I'm I'm not sure uh especially over in England but I think\nThat there is a misunderstanding sometimes with the press there are bad people who are you know racist and ... and everything else\nBut I think that they're this multiculturalism has taken people to a place to where they are you know English are are proud of you know their culture and you know you either like the queen or you don't like the queen I think most people are like ads you know it's part of our tradition but we shouldn't be paying for it\nUm and the multiculturalism that has made it a racist to even say yeah I'm proud to be be English\nOr I'm proud to be American I think that is being taken as racist where I don't think it's meant as racist by the vast majority of people they're just proud of who they are and where they came from\nWell I I I certainly agree with that I I don't see the problem as as multiculturalism itself\nI and I'm In London and then and we generally do quite well we're faced with that yeah the the different ... that a great range is a different culture that\nWill Casey London it is quite a quite excited that you get a tree Chinatown and you can trace say different areas that are also yes some and because it will probably this way it's a lack of a simulation with with some great not books\nThey I did that and it is it is prejudiced too and he had\nTo take to like kill a tradition that that that is a problem and I don't think it is very late and conservatives who say that if the problem running I got and I feel with John high to low foundations yes which pets and loyalty and it's like a tradition outlook conservative\nSide I I see quite a lot of the some of the liberal side too and I think on the far left and steak alike have one's own traditions and culture and as I could say everybody else's and as a form of life and all that she can nice and some tea and\nSeem like I'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states\nWhere Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point\nUm for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman you may you know bad oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so your point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had them tied at one point\nUm ... several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see the ... news well I didn't do that or they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the ... a football game happened and then you go after winning right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the resulted in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is they are actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho was voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get

is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these polls which is a\nIs part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but

I mean you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there's some truth to that says\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell why you take it a punch bowl away from this already just when it's getting boring I tend to I tend to think that he's right about that you know look I don't want inflation but just discussed\nIs picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that that that job is to the squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and uh and hyperinflation renew believe we should watch your guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax breaks and we haven't seen it\nWe're showing inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but I did predict\nWe see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down\nAnd affordable and so I I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively and prematurely and raising rates in in a in a way that wasn't that sort I Am a little concerned by the way out of climate about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why is it going up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you just said\nOkay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\n[laughter] that's a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise in the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf our tax money bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now it's just here you know this\nThe stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's true is up for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and and by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last\nPresident that I heard really take on the bed [laughter]\nWas Ronald Reagan and uh we had Nineteen percent interest rates right shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know\nA lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week on why the\nPresident is the chief executive officer of the country right he is the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct I I think there's a lot of one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years that these are not some kind of or uncles on high at the fed they act as if they're the temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you're going to mention\nI remember the seventies as you do when we had\nLiterally twenty percent mortgage interest rates that was all because of fed\nMistake and I you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know what's the one that built up this bubble that led to the housing crisis in two thousand seven and they I keep thinking these people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nOr and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with the China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars a and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think isn't Steven [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that the Arabs are good\n[laughter] here's my view and I've talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I Am using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal\nWith Mexico he played candidate like a federal or where he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on the night before that the deal had to be seals candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe and then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with that I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this plan but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using on so I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nUh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about that like if we can't trade with China we sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't they were ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that courage and saying look we're not gonna give you unfettered access to our markets if you're not going to play by the rules I talked to a company CEOs all the time is blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market\nYou got to give up ownership of your company has to give up your a trade secret ... I mean we can't live with that is right I ... when he says\nLook I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also warned believe they also weren't or bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly you one quick question for you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on of allies\nAre ... like Canada and ... as a way of negotiating a bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA to point no type of situation\nWell that happened but the steel tariffs are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nThis is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I Hope right the tax plan with my buddy lyric I thought so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum\n'cause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produced I was over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know\nBud wise or they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans and they showed their prices are going up and ... that's going on around the country our auto producers are a lot of us are more expensive because the steel towers so my point to Trump's position even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this\nOh I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good\nJerry ...
