I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was I thought by somebody national award what are the highest I'm most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people crying but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented\nBy the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed it's not a big one so it's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just the criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros that you are an anti Semite is completely insane\nIf you are a ... a conservative\nAnd I the the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize drug stores but they criticize him because he's a liberal as progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him as rounded him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he is a very shady history or around the world\nThat but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew but the way they\nDon't like been Shapiro because in front of me hero importing policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no but because\nHe came up with the idea of communism I\nI'm not a fan no not a fad\nIn the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like within Shapiro said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the with the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest part of the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\nWhat it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is you try to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... again this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive founder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they\nSay it anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat is that that is exactly what they think they claim to be again and they do it every day wow I didn't hear solution there to\nGo to a battering

make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place\nWe have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one no no you don't\n\nIt's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe'd been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell was paved in good intentions and we have great

go and you know\nGo pass out you know go take down Ted Cruz signs or whatever the heck they're they're they're a volunteers are doing on that particular day but there's an interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a district that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then change to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that in people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton and there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a but the ethics Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve\nAnd then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand and sixteen so two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nIn two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats so what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now uh we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in the state so if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those that kind of lost three points\nWell well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six to ... less passionate didn't did you do that and sixteen\nBut a big big move from two thousand twelve got it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correcting now there were Twenty one district that voted for Iraq Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nOr so in two thousand twelve with Rocco bomb on they had about a six point advantage for Democrats for Obama\nIn two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to seven points Republican for Donald Trump says a huge swing there\nBecause it you would think of these real swing districts so far polling is showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half points that's big the big change though and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting and roam around ...\nSo if you look at that the people who were voted for a bomb and then switch to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Iraq Obama\nWave and Romney are the people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton they're in between those two positions but leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these districts show up there is also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive state of Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for all bronco Obama then changed to Trump in the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama in those states in the Trump election there is about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats and it was you know now that part of that is it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWe're this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania's like an example of that where they have just a big lead or not because I don't think that's necessarily solely because of some ... tell me what all this means from last\nWeek or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is\nThere was an eye the hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now ... seems like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all of due to the shooting and the bombing\n[noise] well the polling wouldn't even start probably if you weren't real polling reaction at least till today so you have three I mean you're probably not till later this week Thursday or friday the earlier case
