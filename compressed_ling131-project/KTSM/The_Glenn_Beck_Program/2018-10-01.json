bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by ... head of homeland security as the\nA sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again the woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was ... rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also\nNot a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true\nShe goes in ... her expertise is on old crimes to be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win All right\nBefore I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any it's CNN it's not going to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote\nHere's my bottom line hey she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this isn't even a he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nDon't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for profit institution but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amount of credibility in with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's\nIt won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because\nEvery one who saw this knew exactly what it was\nNow she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute\nIt may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\n\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the\nMost glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lift the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attacked change to the early eighties\nNow you might say what difference does it make well\nIf you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYou're in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've been saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years\nIt gets better this is that again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with her lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged hack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false and it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of

Kavanaugh is a guy who did this I don't want him on the Supreme Court none of us do nobody does that's a bad thing\nBut you can't just smear somebody you have to have some evidence so because of the

J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRace so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that\nThat African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black man for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believed he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it yeah so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me tell you I think a\nDoctor's poured who testified she's a serious person she as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right but when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws or just a it's a series of inconsistencies\nThat would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so the fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows uh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence and then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I\nI saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected\nHarbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in in college or whatever who cares but it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like waiting at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo Shankar what we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat\nOr who are has not lost his footing ah with with reason um\nSo the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this um you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance at USCB Cooper ready to be ... you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular\nSituation other people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial\nOf a um\nThe worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right\nAnd there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented his exculpatory right the the guys calendar clear is that right it's testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely find that the debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way it is is in the court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you were asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who is a very troubled person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not Brett Kavanaugh ... we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine but\nWe can't do is destroy someone's life destroy his family that's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations\nJust because we disagree with them politically or ideologically that's insane that's what they do in in in banana republic spending third world countries that's not who we are in the United states of America\nJohn Carlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second general idea but I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right well run who I mean we'll talk we'll talk some other time magazine\nI really want to I really want to hear from people and uh they can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um um\nWe just have to stop 'em all these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right\nKnow we need to break up their dinners you know as I said earlier one one prominent Democrats said we should um\n... what stops us from just derby people where they sleep\nWell that would be their home\nBecause these people

have to work and be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so the vote 'cause it's a five way race in New York state and we are plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing\nI'm going to happen ... percent ... percent of the vote for third party is a mandate that will shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nElection in the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more boring as a whole but as one single election if I come in first it changes the entire nation overnight\nWho does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean we just had changed the political system overnight\nIt is that important even come in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our potential Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't\nThey're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right but when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say\nDemocrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government\nNow they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive massive\nCulture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nI don't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing I'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire for years as my assumption and I'm fine with that\nBut I have to focus on several things one a complete rebuild of education\nTo a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay for things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government\nAnd that that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with those governments now is they're enforcing the kings will so they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied\nI don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution or what is that I don't know I Know I Know it's a show where he's an old dusty are due to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we sort of the way it while ago but yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual\nBusinesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community we don't do that well in the upset at all we have things called regional economic economic development ah corporations which Albany which is the capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd openness eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county\nHow 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero so they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll give you to an interesting concepts one instead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through the ranks spending\nHere's one idea that those both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial bridge named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that Britain is named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights for the bridge we retain the asset I got an a business gotten

Texas you listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but he is the best part now we have them do maintenance\nWe own it so we still we still inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now when you if they collapse we don't have enough money these guys do will have to have safer
