the purpose of this was and we we got to meet some of the women and the children at the center and see the facility um which were you know again gives them an opportunity secure and safe um but at the same time\nI'm there need of many things and um we we hope that this will help them continue to prosper and get back on their feet and get back on the community with jobs but the center is is a well secured and uh they do provide the women a lot of opportunities to um be educated get some self esteem self respect back\nUm and they have a lot of programs for those women and their children\nDuring the tour is there anything in particular that that really affected your that really stood out to you\nI think the one thing I when we first got there um\nWe were given the kind of a general tour and we met a man a mom or two but when we saw the children returning from school\nAnd to see the children in is how happy they were to be at the center\nUh that was a big impact me I'm used to small children not knowing really what's going on in their lives but to know that they're they're with their mother and had something he just has that impacted me and to see the conditions are you know that they're that they're in it which is safe and secure but at the same time\nUm it it's it's an interim basis kind of thing for them so the children had the biggest impact to me which\nOlden their reaction miles so how long has this has been been been going on and off hassle\nThat says are nine year old ... so it's grown every year and we're really hoping to make an even bigger impact that here we have a goal of a hundred thousand dollars to raise well and we are at about eighty so we're pretty close and that's there still time to for people to register to\nAnd if you're a woman it's an event for men but of course if you want to support you can encourage the guys in your life to register or you can just go on and support either that\nThe event in general or somebody that you know that's participating or if you find we have a team like Wayne's team we have passed electric but we have teams from all sorts of organizations we have a team called the mighty little boys just ended up a fifth graders from ... who signed her dissipate\nOn their own and that's something that they have decided to take on that you could support that team but any amount helps us reached that goal and\nLike Wayne was saying it's it's\nReally impossible to understand that\nAre are\nWomen at our center to go through so much before they get to us and then when they're there\nWe try to help them with things like childcare case management life skills classes things that if you're an abusive relationship you maybe never had a bank account and your own name you never knew how to write a check maybe you didn't have a job you never all sorts of different things that\nAre not the case for everybody there but for a lot of lot of our women it is the case and things that are just second nature to a lot of people you know opening a bank account writing a check\nOr how do you even find a job for an interview what do you do in an interview to even have closed for a job interview a ... once you have that job or do you put your children are to you need help getting your GED or different education and things like that so we really like to say that and\nIt's it's really supposed to be everything they learn is supposed to be to help them move to self sustainability to help them move to something permanent for themselves not all the women there have children so for themselves or for their families to make life the best for them and to move on in their life to get past this really terrible\nWhatever they just experience so like I said it's a really it is I found out that we have a

her she was the actual physical actors who can help raise awareness I guess wing for you what do you feel what do you hope or would you tell people to get out of this when they see yourself doing this kind of\nWell you know I I reach out to family and friends and and uh the first thing they think about the heat wave send me a picture of us read high heeled shoes\nAnd so uh you know it is fun and it
