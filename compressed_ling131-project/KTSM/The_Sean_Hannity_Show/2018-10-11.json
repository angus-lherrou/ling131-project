were ... what's the latest\n[noise] we have a hurricane and is now on land in the last position we have on\nVery dangerous hurricane Michael is about thirty miles east northeastern Panama City or about sixty miles west of Tallahassee, Florida it is moving on to the north north east for the night Fifteen miles per hour maximum sustained winds one hundred and fifty miles per hour it's folic category for hurricane ... percent when hurricane winds scale\nA dentist one landfall was made are we using a I I Know that you we you ... you guys don't like when we focus on a specific spot but around Mexico beach a little south east of tend to live for space\nThat is a little less populated than if you go up the road to Panama City beach for instance uh thoughts on that and uh is it ... it was just shy and landfall just shy of a category five\nRight I mean we had a measurement of the aircraft one hundred and fifty five miles per hour you know they go to one fifty seven to officially be a category five but that's just the statistic you're talking to different from one or two miles per hour from crushing the rush home from a four to five and the grand scheme of things that really doesn't matter uh\nThe uh but just because the founder officially was near Mexico beach that would have put Panama City in the Iraq so they got clobbered [noise]\nYou Dennis uh we're hearing my my show my radio show a is heard on a affiliates\nShould wide one of my affiliates is in Panama City or Ninety four point five FM and we have heard that they're thousand foot tower was toppled or a thousand foot radio tower has come down and we're also hearing that most of the I Am and FM stations in Panama City or off the air right now\nThat will not surprise me remembering Hurricane Andrew came across South Florida back in Ninety two how many uh television or radio towers came down and those kind of wins that and and there was one fifty five one sixty one sixty five so you're in that neighborhood so I I'm not surprised that the towers would have come down\nA dentist one are you hearing as far as from people on the ground or what a huge gathering information was on the amount of damage that has occurred so far\nWe haven't had anything on that other than what we're seeing on television right now our focus continues to be not where the storms are already gone but words going this is still in a category for hurricane which is going to be leaving the Florida Panhandle and going into south western Georgia south western Georgia southern Georgia is going to get a hurricane\nA full blown hurricane or with all the impacts about wind and rain a going with it\nA dentist one area we're talking about dust ah we're talking about what what areas in southern Georgia you to get nailed\nWeren't talking to south western corner of Georgia and that will be on our we're talking ah going up towards kept Denver I'm making a guy that they're all in the path of the storm and then I'll go on to South Carolina probably right on top of Columbia tomorrow\nNow do you expect it to weaken to a category three uh two at at one time frame you know right now we're ... we're still a category for when does it we can and will it says it will it quickly we can\nAnd will spend down but they're remember the storm is so strong it's going to take a while for the winds to spin down so this'll be a good one are good too easily going into Georgia could still be a free uh and we expected to be a hurricane tracking all across Georgia and down to a tropical storm strength as it gets into South Carolina tomorrow\nI saw that as I Know we've got a role here but I Would imagine that a hurricane of this nature a category to potentially hitting a well inland in southern or south western Georgia have they ever seen that before\nA in going back to the records or which go back to Eighteen fifty won the Florida Panhandle has never had a category for hurricane hit them never since Eighteen fifty one so I'd have to go back and see if southern Georgia has ever had anything that powerful I doubt it but I I Can't be sure\nAh Dennis a big difference from South western Georgia or to

help now to these candidates in the president's got what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out now am\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall\nIf they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the\nSuccess of this president and the fuel the the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's your counteracting everything that NATO's trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the ticket and turn off the white blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things\nNobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and now a little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions\nDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there a nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that\nYou know markets would open up to North Korea the people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be\nFor the world and I got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies and on the on the tarmac for mullahs in Iran that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you\nKnow I Want to get in Michelle Obama um was on the today show earlier today and an interview with savannah Guthrie asking about recent comments from Eric Holder about kicking Republicans let's go to holders comments and Hillary Clinton's comments you can't be several with anybody that disagrees with us listen\nTo all over my wife went really high voice scare me [laughter] you know when they go low we go [laughter] go low we read\n[noise] we'll just give us\nTonight several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the ... he can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nThe president really demeaned the confirmation process\nAnd we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you've got to be kidding when you when they go low you just kick 'em\nWell Michelle Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid of their neighbors and you want the main greedy one dimensional\nWondering Michelle Obama say anything when Sarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist moms\nAnd they are mobs and this this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue but the rhetoric is coming from the quote so coal leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a faint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nTo go on your thing and said your neighbors to the doctor whether they're independent or whether they're Republican or you're with them in the face of the foot Mr burgers on Fox News\nOutlets further south against the Sean Hannity so\nThat when someone is cooler acts like a bully you don't just sit there and level now our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high you\nKnow they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witness to a judge Kavanaugh would know due process known presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still I Believe I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that isn't paid\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you don't follow them in the gas stations in grocery stores\nYou cannot be him with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for and what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or that that ... he can start to get\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\n[noise] we in the face of from Congress

application all of it based on the pony dot CA in every case abroad committed upon the size of courts and then the same information that we now have learned the media leaks strategy that existed\nJust before it leaves a page that nobody had any evidence of any Trump Russia collusion at all and Peter Struck said uh there's no there there at all but now we know what the insurance policy was that immediately strategy to to create the impression that there was a lot that they had\nWhen in fact it was them leaking to different news sources to create the impression that this was real\nAnd then of course you know uniting what they're good friend Robert Mueller and that's why it's been a witch hunt or whatever Eighteen months\nThe biggest abuse of power ever that pony dusty I used to manipulate not only by the court judges and commit abroad on them\nBut that information was disseminated before the election so that the American people would buy the lives in the propaganda and and vote for Hillary oh jeez the hookers in a bad urinating in Moscow we can all like this guy\nAnd then it got used again and again and again they weaponize what turned out to be nothing but at the bones set of documents that its own author won't stand by\nAnyway why won't Rod Rosenstein now appear under oath before the committees with Trey Gowdy and Bob Goodlatte where's the subpoena demanding that he turned over the the three oh to lose the size of wars all these things that have been requested\nJim Jordan who's joining us Freedom Caucus member candidate to be speaker of the house of representatives if the Republicans winning twenty six days and congressman Dave Brat of Virginia and by the way congressman Dave Brat who happens to be in one of those districts that is a very very tough but winnable district\nIf you're in what district you in ... in the commonwealth\nHer seventh seventh district Sean much if\nYou're in the seventh district in the commonwealth of Virginia let me tell you something we\nNeed Dave Brat as part of the Freedom Caucus because that's the only group that's been out there fighting to keep the promises that the Republicans made\nYou know for the last seven years and he's been fighting hard every day and he's taken a lot of heat for it and now they're thrown tons of money to get him defeated if you're in the seventh district in Virginia I Hope you go out and vote for Dave Brat maybe help out his campaign if you can and we welcome both of you to the program a gym let me start with you is\nIt is it three or four people now that say that Rod Rosenstein Rona how many have you been out\nThere there there are several and here's the bottom line when the when the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction\nAsk you to come in and testify in this case the chairman the Judiciary Committee you are obligated to do that remember Rod Rosenstein is and it can from when he goes to his confirmation process he gets asked that question will you come and testify under oath an answer Congress has questioned link called is this or that is yes he is obligated to do it and for him not to come\nIs ridiculous particularly in light of what we now know where we have a ...\nA account of someone saying that he was serious about actually recording the commander in chief of this great country so yeah he's in front of us and if he's not going to come in like he's supposed to like you said he was going through then there definitely should be a subpoena will bring him in her deposition\nWell there's a lot that Rod Rosenstein needs to explain and it should be under oath that's the normal procedures to underwrite\nIt sure is it's her you're supposed to come in at Berkeley under oath you're maybe he's the guy who even one Justice Department\nAnd understand the timeline on may ninth\nKobe is fire based on the Rosenstein Nemo or make six pages when he had this conversation but at least a page and Andy McCabe where he says he was thinking about\nRecording the president contemporaneous with that ... held the FBI chief counsel Jim Baker that Rod Rosenstein was serious about that this solemn may sixteen and of course may seventeenth is when Bob Mueller's named special counsel also in San ... what else happened on this thing that today more than ... director\nThe same day just kind of interesting and then of course he doesn't get the job in the next day he named special counsel so this all happens and then as you pointed out in your intro a defies ever know the third Pfizer and they'll get signed one month later so that's sort of the timeline and what we want is all you want to bring in and ask questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this but first of all how is your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't when and on the pilot the or the health care immigration pact or my opponent is a alert you liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you say they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and ... big time in junior right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nA she really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out in the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... a lot in the lab and then she Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia regard to the right thing\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas it and if people want the full list the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that\nThey get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we've got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it up on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there is that that left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never decorate material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in older set about Republican\nWhat are you ... they're going after terrorists Sanders and Pam Bondi and secretary Neely says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialize medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nThe list is phenomenal did this get additional but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going for points you present lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way ... twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do things to make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together that they have no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we've got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understands that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all men on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves the Russia investigation as as a whole are sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what\nDo you make of that uh they brought\nYeah well I'll just go back to the way your frame that you only got ... dot com it's all like you're in Iran over quite get the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan the members of oversight committee he's saying that the American people\nAnd when he just sat in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and all that Jim go on with the so\nIt's not so ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Mueller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should have disqualified him Rosenstein is right about that but in the caves\nAnd many result in serious injury [noise] the majority
