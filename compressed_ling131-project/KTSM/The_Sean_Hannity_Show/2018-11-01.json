since it's protected by the constitution Trump tweeted today that Ryan knows nothing about the issue\nYeah I'm not a big terrorist threat\nHas he apologized for this yet anyway let me give me some of factual background here let me just take a moment before we move on so during the toss and that's where a Chris Cuomo ends his show and then throws it to Don Lemon\nThey do a little back and forth banter I guess I I don't watch Cuomo I don't watch Don Lemon in\nFact uh I don't watch a lot of the the nighttime a fair I'm you know I'm having dinner with the family and we're watching some entertainment stuff you know I've been doing this all day long\nSo okay sue thank you [laughter] suicidal peanut gallery comment if I say it all the peanut allergies\nThese days diamond said peanut gallery was that offensive I get to get my wrists slapped aimed now is the peanut free zone I so I and I understand yes it's deadly for some and the whole allergen thing really just kinda\nAccelerated rapidly over the last what ten Fifteen Years or so ah anyway back to Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo's so almost toss it gets a lemon and this is what Don Lemon actually said on CNN this was Monday Night\nI'm so we have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\n[laughter] ... it's just kind of a real biggest terrorist ... what about most on the right what what about the maniac that shot up the baseball practice in northern Virginia where Steve ... was almost killed and we'll walk with a limp\nAnd a need for assistance with devices I Would imagine for a long time if not the rest of his life I mean really\nIt was a a lefty he was a liberal targeting Republicans was I'm not going to go down the list here and please Don Lemon that was an offensive in the ... comment that you made\nAnd I'm Wondering if he's going to address it or if he has addressed it to correct it started don't be stupid statement I I Want to get into another serious matter and you know the discourse in this country\n[noise] and I just want to tease those 'cause I'll get into this in a little bit and I wanted to swallow and stuff but the discourse in this country is getting horrifically toxic\nI mean I Know I mean we get a lot of it here on the program you know some of the phone calls we get hey guess what folks I got a death threat today that's where I I I got a different today\nSo I get a call from a management\nAt our flagship station this morning someone called in and I'm going to share this I was debating whether I was going to share this or not but but but I Am going to share this morning at my local flagship station\nA call comes in during the morning show and some creepy sounding color says or something to the fact tonight Todd Schmidt is going to die\n\nAnd the guy hung up and of course authorities were contacted in management\nAt our flagship in Tampa you know called authorities or talk to the the Tampa police department and you know they're working on the case and we have you know engineering methods in and phone line tracing capability so I ...\nI I was debating whether I was going to mention it but I think it's important to mention because of the toxicity that is occurring\nOn so many levels whether it's talk radio whether it's television on on all sides I mean you've got Don Lemon calling white men the biggest terrorist threat in the United\nStates the what is happening here folks is a slow motion or medium motion unraveling\nOf American society and I don't want to watch this I don't want to witness this the environment is getting extremely toxic it has been for some time it's not getting better it's getting worse you know in fact I'm going to put the Halloween stuff on hold on to get to it later this hour well let me morph into this I was just going to tease it\nBut you know I'm a stick with this for a second and one of the elements\nThat I read about a in a piece for wired I like why is it a lot of tech website time I've got a book marked I visited I see links like the website there's a story out today and wired that talks about the the\nCorrosive nasty environment which I've known about because I'm In the middle of receiving all of this information and all of this data\nAnd I have social media was active individual as we have phone lines we have email I Do a radio show we're fielding we're feeling a lot of calls from a lot of normal people it's got the most of the people to call the program and interact or normal Americans don't want the best for this country\nBut we do get our share of fringe wackos on both sides\nAnd it's these individuals that are being um you know ramped up there being rally by a lot of this information and the bots that are helping to\nPropagate a lot of this false information and we know the Russians and the Chinese they are trying to take us down from within\nYou know these days folks it's not all about armies and pointing intercontinental ballistic missiles with with multiple mega tunnel warheads or that can destroy cities in white by millions of people instantaneously low\nIt's not the conventional warfare which still we need to protect against and there's a good chance that's going to happen at some point in the future conventional and hopefully not nuclear but you know conventional wars obviously still happen but what is happening behind the scenes is\nHas dangerous on\nOn certain levels\nAnd that is trying to destroy us instead of attacking us head on with a armament and proves there's an attack this happening in this country\nOn an information level\nAnd the Russians the Chinese the box than you've heard about their sowing\nDiscord there's no doubt about it behind the scenes with you know and it's not a secret we know about the Russian but we know about the Facebook in the fake advertising and the fake accounts on Facebook Twitter and other social media site this isn't new we know about it but the tent\nTo which it is happening I don't think people really\nHave a grasp of and realize but countries like Russia and China they're trying to destroy us from within\nI think they're trying to create a civil war of sorts to shred and rip us apart and and tear the fabric of American unity\nAnd I'll tell you right now there is a level of success that's going on right now now there are some statistics regarding some of the bought activity that's driving some of this
