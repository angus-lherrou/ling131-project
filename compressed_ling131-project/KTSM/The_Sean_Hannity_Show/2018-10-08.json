bowl and I saw him in a hall maybe not lined up in a hall\nUm which is very different from the these sworn affidavit that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you ... if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for that one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews\nIt's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think\nSome of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil case is a good man was confirmed he's now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to sleep\nI can that if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that there was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to go\nAfter Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Jarrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the ... only corroborate the thesis of the book there there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia\nCollusion she had on her payroll British spy a who is using Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the ... lawyer\nA shoe you know this is astonishing information ah and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated a federal regulations are very clear you may not should meant the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated in yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are eight classified and the inspector general has it has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant we know the basis of bulk of the information in the by the application John was the\nUnverified are uncorroborated\nDot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that was that he has to be held accountable for that well\nLet's wait and see when the documents that declassified but the answer your question does of course\nUh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently\nThat the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one of the ... not necessarily linked\nThey would he have an obligation to this is what frustrates

through what he went through\nWas disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evils any trusted him we'll tufted act against\nAnd we now know Christopher Steele was bundling information trying to get it to the special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann and Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker himself anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some of the key documents including the so called McCain memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA war was Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel a and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of life can be shutdown that gift the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public\nSo as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week uh we are going to issue a subpoena or to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos\nAnd some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page a tax ah the ah um\nOf the roof or three oh one and some other things\nAll right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow do getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot\nOf big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted ... to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm\nHappy to share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy but\nSo anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia\nBecause they are a hostile regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that ... does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia that added the DNC\nEver get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington\nWho we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd this is my first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ...
