why do you believe that and and I told them the story about two thousand and four where the median again the polls came back\nAnd George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty four team you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats have two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend his like thirty seats that they call toss ups that could swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you could check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference as if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're gonna feel a week from tonight I mean when the when you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to the next president Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival that goes in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but uh yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is a white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty forty no very few of us saw that we could wait I'll give you\nLet's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty

legal standard at some point that you ought to be able to sue\nFor such slander and an libel as comments like this anyway Jeffrey Myers the pits Pittsburgh rabbi who watched eleven of his congregants gun down during their Saturday services saying he's now become the political targeted in he's\nReceiving hate mail for saying he would welcome the president to his place of prayer it's unbelievable anyway you had all these wonderful people they're going to praise God at a temple and their gun down\nAnyway the organization told reporters they now have received three phone calls today alone

say stand up that if you destroy\nOur friends our allies in Israel we will destroy you which by the way is the way it should be\nYou don't get to kill innocent men women and children in a synagogue\nIt's unbelievable the ... the race the rush to politicize pretty much anything and everything that is Donald Trump\nYou know the rabbi said on CNN Trump is my president he's always welcome to visit\nYou know ever since yesterday morning of the fake news fraud media's been circulating what is just the nation's why that somehow Pittsburgh's rabbis didn't want the president to visit and pay his respects after the massacre\nTenant friend of this program she was on with those yesterday\nYou know she exposed this is their hateful garbage a broad that it is and saying those comments come from\nYou know some fringe group but not from that not representative of anybody the mainstream of the Pittsburgh Jewish community\nJerusalem Post today points out you know that this radical group out there or whatever they're not it's not mainstream it's a political group\nAnd they don't want to give them any attention and then anyway anyway so they invited a I guess and interviewed rabbi Jeffrey

thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer a he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that's an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developer wanted a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release where that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Andrew saying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influence in corruption\nWell there's an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's gonna happen because this has been going on for quite some time\nThey've been gathering a lot of evidence Andrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York ... get paid for for night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAnswered and pay a dime at that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under wrote a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaigned on twenty sixteen that was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nYou can't report after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks so CYA so it'll be interesting to report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and\nIn in a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so\nForty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation but Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me
