{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "But I live in if you're not getting all three hours the came commando show and joined Kim's club that's right head over to get Kim Dotcom\nAnd for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom get all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there Tom\nBlow their camp what's going on well I have a question\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have a a website that I have one phone line right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check a function not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you would do is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you\nAlways yeah all really good questions by the way Tom\nYou know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said what they would do is they would have a\nThey employ individuals to support the uh the ... function and how that would work as they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them then those are the three questions I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost should include she goes to those ... question\nYeah and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right so so\nI Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the Web site see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact to getting\nThe same question time and time again of which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like Ben desk chat is free uh there's also live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building for you\nAh yes although the we do have a website it's already been billed than we have another company building or another website all over the heart of it but when we have a third tempting is calling me about that in this chat function\nWouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under ... as the part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bugs and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad stuff you're on the Kim commando show\nYou're listening to him\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life

Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former friends and telling them to get them a get hit in to the Congress to take\nThat said and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene in usa peanuts and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it they say that I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this because this is really important all the names that you heard Michael fuss than Mr liar and said\nOr all those people they are key to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating\nIs what happened in the United kingdom which we that Congress has it and ... issue a subpoena score we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nAnd that you see a cue to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information was in fact conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of intercepting those compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary's emails or anything else and they never gave information to the by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin I is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribed under oath or before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions\nWhen you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information\nThey would do it that way well Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction

feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contributor thirty or CIA up operations officer\nA doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruined in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questions I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate\nThis man was a journalist wasn't and Americans that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type that you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Ruth brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen ...\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of living that ... entered and we know he just show again never exited the costs\nAre we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... the one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly numbering ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know it was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashioned secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were a shoe a grave concerns what\nWill get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters\nI Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm saying it was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shows\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this with that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics itself domestically it is the author of the possible lumpy on over the perfect\nI'm On the truth fish or we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very good ties through a and B as to how much been found them in a with a those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so\nThere's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\nWar I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we don't knowing that gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort guy can I give

[laughter]\nHere's Sean Hannity\nAnd there was a twenty four team study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around its point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that is why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and in the back burner and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not just a partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call at least officers race front to back\nMe I called them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics\nAbout getting the job done ... onto the approve this message\nThat is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now till the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get re elected a senator or she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools he identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this then tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics of the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against\nElizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld than Mitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never endorsed a Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush um\nWhen Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist printed that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House in ... when you're twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about our ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "El Paso", "day": "21"}
