after entering his country's consulate in Istanbul\nLike I said hey something completely different then we'll get back into the normal daily death and destruction wow added Davis, California there is a full blown police investigation\nTo find out whether students in a high school a grandma's remains him cookies that were brought to school what yeah there is a former best big Asia Pacific Davis, California\nAnd the story is that a a student possibly laced sugar cookies with the ashes all his grandma\n[laughter] gave them my classmates hey would you like some delicious sugar cookies what they possibly could have been much should on grand mom\nThis is according to CBS in Sacramento CBS local affiliate and a number of students ate the cookies and da Vinci high school and the story is in police are investigating and they suspect that the sugar cookies contained\nThe ashes of one of the students grandparents\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah I mean ... ... brownies cookies et cetera yeah\nUh all the marijuana animals that are for sale these days and these recreationally legal marijuana states [noise] so the cops say they weren't sugar cookies outta brought 'em in having them out to at least nine students\nThe uh Davis\nPolice lieutenant Paul Dora shop says this is the first they've never had anything like this he said this is a weird one I've not heard anyone getting sick\nOr anyone being harmed as far as physically but psychologically what I can be a whole different story folks so they're working to confirm that to high school students were part of this this plan this devious I mean this set go I mean really morbid plan\nTo have their fellow students eat the ashes of\nGrandma\nSo there's a full blown investigation at this point the Davis join union school district issued a statement saying that it couldn't comment on confidential student matters but there is an ongoing investigation\nA man can you imagine\nAnd I guess uh some students that tip offs are led to this investigation I mean how gross would that be you know they they mix in some uh grandma's ashes into the sugar cookies that's gross and what I say yesterday let's move on\nWhat am I say yesterday about this Elizabeth Warren thing I mean right out of the gate I said this was a gigantic mistake what else do I point out from yesterday show I pointed out that a for instance CNN\nCNN was going Gaga oh finally profiling civil war and the senator proves that she's got Indian blood that she is part Indian and it was just over the top even though the Boston Globe even though the globe\nHad pointed out in their article that it couldn't be six eight ... a six to ten rather I don't want a short trip that it could be six ten generations down the line\nWhich would make the percentage of Indian DNA or blood in Elizabeth Warren it would make it tiny it would make it miniscule in fact and I pointed out on yesterday's program that the Boston Globe had to correct their math\nTwice yesterday not once I I'm Sorry three times that they had to correct their math or I think it was three times let me tell you why\nBecause and I have little correction notes because with the possibility of Senator Warren having Indian blood going back between six and ten generations in Tempe generation\nThat would've made her a percentage one one thousand twenty fourth one slash one thousand twenty four originally the Boston Globe had that at\nOne five hundred twelve so they they had a double if they were wrong so then\nThey had at the six generational points the Boston Globe had senator Warren's Indian percentage at one thirty second terms I guess what\nThat also was wrong and ah\nThey update that to one sixty fourth so listen anyway you slice it it's just a joke here and I pointed out yesterday a couple of things the CNN website they had a big screaming headlight or a headline\nIn headlights a big screaming headline that a Senator Warren uh shows that she has Indian heritage\nAnd you know you had to get to the story to find out you know whether it was in the small print ... up in the proverbial small print that ah it was a six and had it was way remove way down the line and that was\nThat was sort of buried in the CNN story so on TV they were going to get any on their Web site they were all guinea well guess what\nNow we have a Chris Cillizza the CNN editor at large and he does a lighter writing on their website a sill is also appears on a lot of the the CNN programs so he writes a piece\nTwenty four hours later a lizard as Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit\nDraw I haven't really uh you think\nMean I we pointed this out immediately and many which are intellectually honest you know in my line of work on there is on the conservative commentary side and it wasn't just that actually some mainstream media also pooh poohed this that wow\nShe's making a big deal out of this you know the the video\nThe five minute and I think thirty seven second video that in this campaign style little law many or a bio pic little documentary that she pulled out\nIt was deceptive you know one of the terms that the my my wife loves to use she's an attorney she was a prosecutor for a bit until we had kids\nAnd my wife always ah even with me or the kids if you don't give the whole story\nOr my wife wants to use the terminology this seat by own mission\nAnd you know I'll queuing up and I'll play and after the break I'll play the audio but it was totally deceitful Emily Elizabeth Warren video when she has the DNA specialist is Dr bustamante Carlos Bustamante\nI consulted twenty three and me and an ancestry dot com now that this guy has some good shops good bona fide he's but guess what\nWhen they show the scene all the big reveal so to speak\nLike some kind of TV reality show the big reveal the clip she's on the phones sitting down at a table in her house and he's in his office oh and I and he says that Oh yes you do have a Indian ancestry what they did point out was the fact that it could be back as far as ten\nGenerations\nMaking a tiny little Biddy fraction they eliminated that you know I'm going to that up here and just a second 'cause I I think it's very important\nFor you to hear that to solidify the point I'm trying to make fun again we were all over this yesterday was she thinking she is she should've just stayed quiet she's made matters worse Democrats are saying well why the hell did you do this this close to the midterms and guess what this was not a slam dunk\nThis is not even a base hit it's not even getting hit by a pitch\nThis I mean this was awful\nAnd as a total backfire\nAn absolute complete backfire in fact earlier tonight CNN headline that Elizabeth Warren a DNA than they did it backfire yes it did oh CNN glad you can

different type of president\nPlay a with his tactics of labeling people in in using name calling and just being a you know a whole different type of commander in chief and less and that's one central we got him elected\nA and a that's a lot of what Trump's audience expects so Elizabeth Warren is not try to play in this\nArena so she tweets out\nWe all know why at real Donald Trump makes creepy

long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nYeah I I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know eat fish again never exited the consulate\nUh we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this numbering ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concerns what\nWill get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary rod said they needed a void speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm paying with needing and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legalized fish in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there is a very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the rainy and had you had many in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat a Nazi ism in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean if you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like on a fixture self domestically it is the author of the ... the uh over the perfect on on the truth is short we have a lot of a matter of rich or with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B asked um it's been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this\nIs part of a ... I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we know knowing that gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort can I can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood\nOne of the teachers was Missouri selling miss her so she gave me direction every\nSingle time I had a question she'll put down whenever she's doing that you come over and just sit there we are to you get it\nAt age ...\nWhat the hell you're\nFinishes high school diploma\nFifty percent of getting your high school diploma is walking through those doors\nGetting your high school diploma it is a life changing experience it really is kind of pulls you were you want to go\nAnd get a loan\nIf you were thinking of Tennessee nor I have\nRead that you came near you finish ... or ... or ... by the dollar general energy foundation and the ad council\nAccuser after you wanted money back from the card says you put a camera on his house after the he was black male but that didn't match the detective said within CBS for news update I'm Nate beret\nThis is a Bloomberg market Bennett stocks were lower at the end of a volatile mid week section the Dow Jones industrial spell Ninety two points a third of a percent to twenty five thousand seven hundred six then as dogs three point decline down to one point last for the U.S in the five hundred barely move the meter percentage wise\nPredictions about a recession can be unsettling for investors and Steven Stanley ... pure ... securities tells Bloomberg there have been a lot of them recently\nIt seems like people in the markets are another great big hurry to talk about the next recession twenty twenty things a little premature to me but you never say never\nStanley says monetary policy is still easy for now minutes from the fed September meeting revealed there was a debate among policymakers over whether to temporarily hike interest rates too restrictive levels home loan demand declined last week mortgage bankers were bored application volume fell as fewer people sought purchase loans and\nFewer homeowners book to refinance ...

time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Jeff deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax hikes and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call a lease officers racist from front to back\nMe [noise] I called them heroes men and women\nMy campaign isn't about party politics is about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this\nMessage or that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now so the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean ... is our number ... ... ads by Jeff deal was born she doesn't have to get reelected as senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth\nLook here's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is\nNative American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five he listed herself as a Native American and the director of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out she is approximately between one sixty one sixty four and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that is less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this then tries to prove\nTo her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts slant solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but the really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible jobs that are the people in Massachusetts can wake up how you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm and you know stop brown one when he ran again or of\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front at that time she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "17"}
