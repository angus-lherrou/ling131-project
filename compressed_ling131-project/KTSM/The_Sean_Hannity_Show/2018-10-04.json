eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number or how you get on the program it's a very very simple process\nSo why don't we start\nWith what's making a lot of news generating a lot of chatter today\nAnd that is the comments that the president made at the rally in Mississippi last night\n[noise] couple of things in this is obviously ruffled some feathers a first of all what's what's wrong with this particular state but I Can't find anything wrong with this what's happening\nNow [noise]\nThey had gang rang again [noise]\nTurned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty until proven innocent\nThat's very dangerous Veronica\nAnd I haven't myself all the time\nYou know I Can't argue with that I get is a guilty until proven yeah and that's what's going on uh with with capital here and you know if you go back and listen to the statement of this this is not the one that has people really ticked off but I don't want my this is important\nWhat turned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty until proven innocent and\nAgain that's a very important point there and that's what's happening here\nBecause there's no a collaboration there's no proof again with the doctor Ford story in fact there were a three of those name but couldn't recall or even the the ally\nOr this this ... ties are the ally of Dr Ford could not remember the events of the party or capital I mean I I Would think that that would be a kind of an indelibly inscribed in your or whatever lobes or in your ... uh handle that data but but no\nAnd you know those that have to and this was watch most troubling to me and I don't take sexual assault or rape\nLightly it'll it occurs in his despicable I feel from the bottom of my heart to anyone any woman that's experienced any type of a an assault on what the touching a rape it is it is horrific\nYou have my ... most uh empathy in in that department but the way this has been treated is the capital by many Kevin O's already done convicted guilty he did it taking Dr ... a doctor or for the word that\nIt was an absolute proven foregone conclusion and that's just not the case All right so that was one of the items to walk to the plate Trump's a hundred percent right however\nThe president went a little further and this is where the president is getting a whole lot of attention here was this an intelligent move last night at this campaign style rally in Mississippi\n[noise] thirty six years is a there's a\nI had one beer [noise] right I had one beer\nWell do you think it was

[noise] I don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house\nNow says where was I don't know what I had one that's the only thing I remember [noise]\nIs the president wrong there in the factual presentation really not time in the president's correct in what Dr Ford cannot remember the issue here\nThe ... and she did know upstairs downstairs 'cause she described that landing and she did describe the room upstairs across from a bathroom I'm mistaken however again what was that the house I mean we get we don't even know what how soon as I ... I guess you could describe anything\nThe point is the president for the most part they're not factually incorrect in fact the president's right\nHe caught him said what he said in a different fashion that did not alienate free of votes that he needs one cabinet\nNow that's that's what with the issue is here he could have done this in a different fashion\nUh and we already have a Collins was walking into a Senate rule him earlier today and TV cameras captured senator Collins commenting on what's being described as the president mocking Dr Ford last night and this is what that sounded like I\nSaid ...\nAll it's common saying that the president's comments were just plain wrong we had Senator Flake for instance he was on the today show this morning standing next to his buddy Coons\n[noise] well I've there's there's no time and no place for remarks like that\nBut it's\nFlight ...\nCollins and then also Murkowski is also a made a comment in the last couple of hours about those comments again the president could have talked about\nDr Ford and she couldn't remember anything could have talked about it in a more factual presentation but he did it more in a a you know a

would make a great Supreme Court justice listen as far as you know drinking habits and and juvenile things fed at sixteen and Seventeen years old and ... I don't care I I really don't\nI and I'm just not buying and ... there's just not enough factual evidence to prove that Dr force allegations are correct the issue again is the president I don't think needs to install any additional\nSpeed bumps or a obstacles hurdles to get underway\nOf Brett Kavanaugh and that's why I don't think some of his comments in Mississippi last night I don't think they're actually helpful\nFolks I Can't sit here and say that the president didn't didn't openly for applause and laughs in and getting up a crowd and Mississippi didn't mock\nDr Ford now was the president wrong on most of the front slow factually the president was raped I brought up the same things on this program\nAbout her inconsistencies and not knowing this or that there's nothing wrong with the president could have done that it's just it's the mocking issue and today Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing a little after one o'clock this was the first briefing and in quite some time a couple of what three weeks or so I was I think since early September it's been a while\nAnd Sarah Huckabee's uh what was it the the Thames okay September tenth so you know a couple of three weeks or so so ah Sarah Sanders defended the president\nI Am [noise]\nBut I I ... the facts were mostly right it was just the demeanor which I don't find helpful and again I don't need the president's alienating the votes that he needs again\nWe've got three Republicans that are needed we've got Murkowski we have Susan Collins we have Jeff Flake all three have now chastised the president for his tone last night I don't think it's helpful\nI mean this the mob mentality I you know torture caring yeah it ... sometimes it's good sometimes it works but there are other times when\nIt does it you have to intelligently apply\nThat strategy I don't think last night was intelligently applied at all\nAnd then we have of course the the red state Democrats we've got Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota we have a Joe Manchin of West Virginia and again those are votes that could help push Kevin all over the finish line as well so you know the question is\nBefore I go back to your phone calls you what is the endgame here what is the president's goal\nAs far as getting Kavanaugh across the finish line\nBecause I got my comments last night by the president will not helpful for that particular goal\nSo is it possible that the president has concluded that the fight over Kavanaugh is may be worth more in the midterms than actually having\nJudge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that a a possibility is there a chance that Trump and his advisors in strategist think that he can get some more mileage by you know ... up the base getting them out to vote in the midterms\nProfessor for to hire a radical left wing attorney who attacked Paula Jones well it's only ten or twelve minutes\nTwelve minutes he dropped his parents and said that really that's not a\nProblem for Deborah cats are defending Al Franken anyway we'll see in the political fallout of all of this now is Kavanaugh's now the president's approval rating is an all time high at fifty percent today and the president laying out the facts in this particular case we've got an election in thirty three days\nAnd every poll is now showing that the Senate races in the enthusiasm gap is heightened dramatically and significantly which is the right thing why because\nI think the American people learning a lot that this is the Democratic party playbook\nIs a party that doesn't believe in due process or presumption of innocence there's a party that regularly smears Flanders\nUses character assassination character blood Janine all in the process to gain their own power is not one agenda item that you can cite any Democrat that they're running on in thirty three days that's going to make the country a better place\nThey don't seem to care at all at what they've done with\nJudge Kavanaugh or when you look at the evidence and you look at the facts as the FBI did now they're attacking the FBI\nWhat do you find out is that there is zero corroboration\nTo the claims of all three women in the ... not even including\nThe cases of outright lying that were dismissed early on about judge Kavanaugh\nThey just dismiss it altogether but none of this would ever make it into any court of law and there might actually end up being significant legal consequences to Julie sweat Nick and some other people based on what Alan Dershowitz another saying should happen\nBecause of the things that they said the backtracking that took place and perhaps even lying\nUnder the threat of a felony anyway news roundup information overload our Jonathan Gillum author or sheep no more Danielle McLaughlin is with us um I don't know if this was going to impact the election and thirty three days but I think it certainly has energized\nEvery every part of the Republican coalition that recognizes this for the grave injustice that it's banned in the smear campaign that it's been Jonathan\nWhy Korea and you know I think this has definitely caused um some good reactions and conservatives across this nation I'm also a free thinking or people who used to subscribe to the Democrats\nAre the Democrats' way of thinking are are now saying this is this isn't really politics this is\nI'm kind of criminal behavior the way a wad of this stuff is\nOut in Washington DC right now we're going to be the dark thing that we've seen 'em or whether it be just the sheer way that the FBI has been used and I think what's happening is\nIt's solidify and people that they don't want to play this game and people are starting to get on the same bandwagon I Do think it's going to have a huge outcome and the election I think that people are going to say they're tired of this nonsense it's on the west um they may not agree with everything on the right but I think it's going to cause a backlash\nYou're going to defend Europe below of liberal democratic socialist party Danielle\n... he had to get a show on on could opt in any everybody excited to be here I I honestly I Want to tell you that there's going to be I think that crashed on the left as well you know um there are concerns about ah the nominee are there a consensus investigation wasn't\nDial cave but others say anyway hurdle we've heard all the allegations\nYou know that professor Ford's so called eye witness was contradicted her testimony and her accusation\nWe know in the case of ... Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence in cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute but everybody's talking on the head\nWith a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of missed for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed themselves\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift and backtrack\nFrom her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so could you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people\nAre saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that to happen that way at all\nSo the judges are college roommate and staying on at the last twenty four hours at looking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know there's not a talking point what hang on a second I Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do was we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location and she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAll they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo know what else can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you now you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bouncing ball all of the people if there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home\nWe don't even know the house but you mentioned for people with their ... for people under penalty of fellow they all said it didn't happen the way she said one witness or didn't happen\nAnd so my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that
