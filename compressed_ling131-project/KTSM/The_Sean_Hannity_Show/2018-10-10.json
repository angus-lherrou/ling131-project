category for hurricane when it makes landfall tomorrow\nMichael's currently a category three with winds of a hundred and twenty miles an hour\nBut forecasters are expecting it to intensify a little overnight oil companies are shuttering rigs in the Gulf of Mexico due to Michael Reuters reports that oil producers have evacuated at least Seventy five oil platforms that represents a forty percent drop in the daily crude oil production from offshore wells in the Gulf\nWell I really don't I mean the difference here is is that it's gonna make landfall and about twenty four hours and right now it's in a it's an intensification stage\nSo even if nothing happened to make landfall a hundred and ten mile an hour hurricane that's still a pretty big deal I'm you know I I I Would think there's a higher chance of it being a three or four than it is one or two but you know we've learned over the years the intensity forecasting is not perfect\nYou know I think regardless of the cat number two three four it's going to be a really big deal for the pan handle potentially catastrophic and if you're familiar with kind of the vegetation up in that part of the state it's a lot different than it is here in Tampa Bay it's just a lot more trees\nA it's a different climate and there's going to be just widespread power outages that could last days weeks maybe a month or so in some places and then it's not just to be a coastal for the thing that's going to move into Georgia and the Carolinas and bring some wind issues and power outages this was not going to be\nJust the state of Florida storm it'll continue moving northeast up towards North Carolina\nAnd Paul I know you're in a tight schedule doing whether graphics for your for five and six PM a cast a storm surge now if you couldn't let let's direct this directly my listeners that are on the the the Florida Gulf Coast in the pan handle the Panama City listeners those to the east those or to the west\nA let's talk storm surge productions are potentially eight to twelve feet of storm surge in of course that can be deadly\nYeah and that's all I think it's eight to twelve feet in the past is to cedar key um even here even here we've had we've had high water around Tampa Bay and there's been some flooding\nIn a way down towards Naples or what some high water she got to think of of the Gulf of Mexico as being like a big ...\nBecause it's almost close to close circle and that water when it begins flashing along our coast really piles up though it's a whole different set up here on the Gulf of Mexico there it is on the Atlantic side when the water is deeper into the water off the coast of the panhandle in off our west coast is pretty shallow\nAnd it really piles up quickly so on our west coast storm surge\nIs the big problem up in the big band and the panhandle storm surge it's wind and it's and it's raining so that's that's how that's\nGoing to play out and I saw in the Tampa Bay area which is my back yard 'cause my home is you know is right on Tampa Bay or two to four feet I I don't know if we'll see much really that'll affect us but\nI you know I I just I feel for the people in the panhandle right now if you want to do as as a a well trained a meteorologist who's dealt with the hurricane activity for decades Paul what do you say to my listeners there in this path or\nTo the east and west the Panama City beach\nOr the water always wins don't don't ever try to fight the water because the water will end up in places you never think the water's going to go if you're told to evacuate\nGet out I mean there's always the chance and it happens a lot that you can leave and the next day and says you know I probably should have stayed but trust me it's it's not worth\nA try to ride out a storm on the coast especially a storm of this magnitude if you're told to leave just find someplace away from the water again you're evacuating from water you're not evacuating from when\nYou got to get away from the water the only time you evacuated from wind is if you live in a mobile home and there's a chance to your mobile home can be compromised you've just got to get away from the water the water by far is the number one killer when it comes\nTo hurricanes and Paul last thing here I'm timeline we're looking and about this time tomorrow\nYeah to get bad late tonight and then tomorrow will make landfall ah and then it'll move inland but it's not going to be just a quick deal it's going to the impacts are going to be far ranging and we'll be doing stories of storm damage in Georgia South Carolina North Carolina but obviously\nA it'll be worse where the storm does make landfall in Panama City beach is pretty built up now there's a lot of lot of stuff up there that wasn't there ten Fifteen Years ago and a lotta stuff literally sits on the Gulf of Mexico\nI've driven right by so I've seen all the buildings on the construction all the high rises though the motel the hotels and and the condo so I'm driven right along\nThe road there right adjacent to the beach and um if we can call this a lighter note did you see that the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office issued a press pass warning to Jim ... of\nThe weather I got I saw that tweet it's kind of funny or you know they yeah he's yeah\nWell he does a great job and and you know the thing is you know you when he when he shows up your your town you know the stuff's getting real\nYeah and and that's the point is if it ingests there was more of a a joke from the Santa Rosa accounting for the sheriff's office they don't want Jim Kent Tony their nose when Jim shows up it's it's going to be bad typically\nCome down in the summer just don't come down in September and October\n... that's that's what they said Pol Pot belly got a chief meteorologist the Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay Florida Paula thanks we'll talk to you soon\nOK buddy how good that thanks\nAlright so there we haven't uh again I Want to take this time out on my national program\nAnd also let's keep in mind that a lot of the oil platforms have a shutdown and evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico so you're saying you know if you're in Las Vegas our why does this concern me or if you're up in the Pacific northwest you know why or or Minnesota why why should I care about this well one\nOf the reasons is this does have the potential to push up\nA gas prices because you've had a whole series of the oil\nAnd gas natural gas and oil producing platforms\nIn the Gulf of Mexico I have been evacuated so a lot of\nThe production staff have been taken off of these platforms in production has been shut down and over the years we've seen that that has had an effect on oil prices which in turn will ah Jack up the prices at the pump\nAnd of course we know that\nThe market looks for any reason to raise prices whether it's a Texas crude whether it's the you know a gasoline futures whatever\nI'm sure the the prices are already rising it at the pump so that's why the whole country you know needs to be aware that it's not just you know the impact of the storm itself but there is an economic impact in many cases\nFor the whole country when we have these storms because of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico so again or to my floor to listeners\nOn the the the northern ah\nA part of the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle please heed all warnings were going to follow this we have a lot of ground to cover today or next I Want to get into Nikki Haley so why did Nikki Haley\nResigned as you know if you're a regular listener I\nA a great affection for Nikki Haley I thought she did a wonderful job is to South Carolina governor I've got a lot of friends in the low country and and uh and upstate in in South Carolina and everyone I Know really love Nikki Haley I and\nAs UN ambassador she's done a fantastic job again uh another thing that Trump is done right is\nIs you know now it seems pretty seriously hey there's a new sheriff in town here and we the United states we're not going to get beaten up any longer by the United nations and the bulk of the countries in the UN that that hate us\nOr it's America first I'm had no issue with that that's not code for anything America ... at first than white supremacy you know some want them to say America First that's that's code for white supremacy that is that's BS\nI don't care what color you are I don't care what religion you are I don't care what floats your boat in this country if you're an American citizen you oughta want America First and this country first so why did Nikki Haley\nAnnounced her resignation or for the end of the year here or there is some speculation and well let's drill end will also grab your phone calls coming up on Smith if you want to get an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine a just a little more on that trust password Jim can't tore of course from the weather channel\nAnd again the\nRead here from the police in Santa Rosa County Florida is you have Jim can't tore it showing up well that means they probably have a bad hurricane so let's give them a press pass warning so he doesn't come here and therefore maybe the hurricane won't you know it's it's more ingest obviously that's gonna have no effect on the path of the hurricane\nBut from what I get this this is from\nAh ah\nTo P. N. J. dot com and the and the Florida Panhandle the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office has a playful message for the weather channel Jim can't tore stay away from a year\nAs the panhandle braces for a serious storm and hurricane Michael the law enforcement agency took a friendly jab at the meteorologist they actually did a poster like a wanted poster or with the press pass warning\nAnd a push push this out on their Facebook page to issue a fake trespass warning to can't tore\nComplete with photos that have physical description of the weatherman identify kids' toys a person of interest\nAnd adds

[laughter]\nWeren't even hungry zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on should you want to get in\nRegarding the breaking Nikki Haley news from earlier today eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine we will if you're on hold about Nikki Haley will get your calls here in just a moment so why did this is there more\nThan the story on why she resigned yeah many people think that\nThere are couple of factors that potentially are at play here or one of the factors is she wants to make some money\nYou know you look at what she's made as far as uh in in South Carolina politics or them as the south Carolina Governor and now as the U.S ambassador to the United nations uh Nikki Haley has earning potential\nUh clearly far greater or in the private sector than she does in in public service and you know looking at some of the research that's available online\nI if you look at her a twenty Eighteen financial information that was officially disclosed\nShe has a you know outstanding debt\nA credit card debt between twenty five thousand in sixty five thousand dollars there is a mortgage a of more than a million dollars\nAnd there's also a line of credit between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand dollars and with kids college age going you know the question is is Nikki Haley\nEnergized to hop into the private sector and\nMake a big score I mean she ah clearly will have any number of options available to her in any variety of fortune five hundred companies or a board seeds I mean she has a chance to make a lot of money and certainly clear all that debt\nAnd and have a whole lot more additional income so is that the reason is Nikki Haley ready to parlay her experience you know prior to running for president on the Republican ticket in twenty twenty four which I think will happen\nOr is she ready to take the next let's say five or six years and\nTry to rack up some coinage I I think that\nThat does make sense to me uh some of the other possibilities are some of the other rumblings unwind Nikki Haley is calling it quits that it might be some pressure from within\nI don't know if this is as likely as the monetary suggestion but some are suggesting and floating that are hard liners inside the administration like a Mike Pompeo secretary of State John Bolton national security advisor\nThat well they don't see her as enough of a hard line or could there have been a push again we don't know the whole story well there will be leaks or will there be additional information surfaces on why did Nikki Haley really live and who knows\nBut these are the the ideas that are being a rumbled about being talked about and uh\nThen you know of course you know running for president in twenty twenty four ah if she's not going to challenge Trump those that say oh she's going to try to primary Trump in twenty twenty I I don't see that happening I think twenty twenty four is likely and\nWould believe that she'd want to maintain the visibility inside the administration for as long as possible uh on the national stage if she wanted to go ahead and try to parlay that into a potential run and twenty twenty four I for me\nFor me the the most likely scenario is trying to use the next five plus years to make some serious calling\nTo make up over seven figures a year which I think she can easily make\nToday is Donald Trump approval ratings among black voters thirty five percent in the ... report survey\nThis day last year was twenty three percent so in one year Trump's approval rate among African Americans is jumped from twenty three percent to thirty five percent no matter how you feel about polls eight twelve point jumping a year\nSignificant because I'm telling you folks in you'll you'll notice\nEvery presidential race Ninety percent eighty eight Ninety two percent of the black vote goes Democrat if that number ever became Seventy percent the Democrat Party would be up the TPP they would be in deep doo doo\nAnd they know it and everybody else knows it\n\nNow there's twelve point increase this is especially true in surprising considering the constant drumbeat from the press that Trump is a racist pig\nSomebody's not buying it and it's not just Kanye West's if this number grows just a little bit the Democratic party is as I say in deep deep e\nAnd there is a story here celebrity insider Jay Z and Beyonce the are completely done with Kim ... Kanye West after ... latest ... ... ... ... a lunch with Trump in the oval office tomorrow\n[noise] somebody told me if that happens there'll be a big mistake Trump need not have lunch with some celebrity after this hurricanes don't do it cancel it\nI said no take Kanye West you if you go down there in view of the disaster put ... put Khan you're on a jet and go down there and survey it that's how you have lunch with it you don't break the date\nThat came along with you [noise] that's what I told them to do [noise] anyway you know we like success stories around here\nAnd everybody here is a success story many of you in this audience are success stories simply safe is a success stories\nAnd we love them we love optimistic positive achievement we love\nSuccess and success stories simply safe is one of them there are a lot of reasons to appreciate what simply safe as a ... they took on an established\nMarket the homes security market with a totally brand new way of doing it\n\nAnd it was understandably away and it was going to require people to be somewhat technologically educated and flew it\nSimply safest home security company that is growing by leaps and bounds because so many\nPeople in this audience have come to rely on them for a safer home a safer apartment a safer condo that's right you can have a security system in an apartment that your rent now or in a condominium\nSimply safe has built a really good home security system using technology in New ways\nYou start with the fact it's built to operate on why fight no wires that is so huge terms of installation in terms of trouble shooting problems in terms of saving time no wires means no construction\nI mean that's the biggest deal here\nCellular is used for the monitoring the base station that knows whether or not your house have been broken into her caught fire to call the cops are the fire department no wires at all\nAnd because of that it is easy to set up and it's easy to use they made sure it works in the event of power outages or downed wires it'll all work\n\nAnd unlike our home security companies simply said never asked you to sign a contract\nWhen you utilize the monitoring service other outfits do you cite two year contract and promised to spend fifty dollars a month or more for simply safe the monitoring is fourteen Ninety nine and its\nMonthly go on line simply safe usa dot com you'll get ten percent off if you buy a system\nAt that website now offer according to remember just that website simply safe usa dot com oh sixty day money back guarantee\nMeaning if you try it two months later you don't like it send it back we'll get your money back you won't send it back you'll like it simply safe U.

into North Carolina and then we expect to that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and uh on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher or over a million power outages we expect to occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparations now and I would listen to local authorities of the telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and um\nUh you know our thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this was the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who state\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's gonna be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he has been as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony rushing dusty aid that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money\nIt was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify because three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse\nAnd the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail\nThey don't want to be under oath at all now the house Judiciary Committee aide said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying\nDiddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why signs of the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to find some warrants you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one\nIf there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation Lisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there's no there there but\nAnyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA they get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod a Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just asked Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix

David the Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person swearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and I turned it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling box\nThe news at this hour that Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't wanna have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there is no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as this impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nI'll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows they'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a deal Jake who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that

news radio since Ninety cagey at them and\n\nWe can get you a\nCongressman Jim Jordan and congressman mark\nMeadows All right so the next step then is what I mean do we do I need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy his office and chairman Goodlatte stop us and say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why that would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing up with a third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number in\nGreat at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it you're listening interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with the FBI remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person that the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adult\nSo the so called trio too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include McKay number so we we need all that information and again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please do oh two two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think\nWith all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath or

edition of the Beatles single mother after discovering they hadn't accidentally printed version that included session musician Andy right playing drums Ringo Starr copies\nOf the disc featuring the wrong version reportedly selling on ...\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist massage units you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics going to use the Republicans would scatter well\nThey tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up\nAnd we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Orange County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democrat Party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to\nAnd if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections uses a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend and and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness stage just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the tempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... up this rage not\nAll of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense why me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called a rape is Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you\nHave to oppose that train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital so that that's what's leading to this ... this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this if this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned especially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments of Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\nBrock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which is a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments\nThat is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the AIDS and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near\nFuture yeah and don't forget shown that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals\nMoms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has\nWas uh twenty six appointees to the circuit courts and there's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well so this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come open\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat if it gets very decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed with cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority on the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nA start way
