I Would I rented\nTo um what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator and when I was in Washington with during the Capitol hearing said he was a total jackass during those hearings is coming out of where I was going in and I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I'm Michael\nOver and say you know send a drink over I

I mean I've asked myself what I had always said you know it's just another man of the Quander that's why I say I'm a fair I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the only come out and then if I'm with my wife told me it would come out and then it will go by what my response would go viral but I think they pick and choose their targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe they aren't the largest and they know this well it's a it's it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk away\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect they were doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nAnd I couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means\nWe don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had a parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process it they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the ... the president during the campaign but you can\nTell you say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me\nHis message is rent Kareem tell him as a message that lives within the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which\nIs which is really go for what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly bright and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular thought he was going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this\nDay but if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word or\nEducation from the Latin is didn't do good eye to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nI think the left is authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and they don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to them for years at the same thing

invasion of our country\nWill be nice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and\nYou know now they're trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this and yet you keep reading reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well fed food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but\nYou know what's happened to the seven thousand is going to be ten thousand more is it going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan you know everybody come here because ... ...\nI think between and I've been saying this and\nBelieve it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there's Tylenol Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the

the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially when that the only place they

radio six Ninety eight DSM\n\nK GSM [noise]\nNBC News radio I'm Phil Hewlett\nThey accused synagogue mass shooter will face a judge tomorrow afternoon\nHi it's getting sicker every day I mean I noticed the same thing the ... the Maxine Waters\nYou know you get a crowded you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell much McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about that the guy smashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever can critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book\nUh and it's put nominal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer\nOr is it hang up that infect light or the ... and has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian the caravan issue of the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base\nThat Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credential judge\nAh he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump\nTwitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the order to to try a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say the CBs carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's a she says all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states I don't get a you know I'm I'm I'm I'm promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lotta left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such a ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months that as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is it you cannot system ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else's devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders in her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she's they're all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a\nCollege campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf east professor Sean or liberal but it's about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring and industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around and they're back happily working\nAnd some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming

Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people tendency ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the bottom it looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your bar poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be several liberate once you get selected that her staffers they're emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that her party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that ... that's what we do it very possibly confirms suspicions and we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first and I'm In conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and nearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to them out or if they have to work with the moderates and they and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well day so\nIt's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about so many people\nKnow I Know and it it it's in her to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri there ... Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm a poor and it and let me say something all Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks\nAnd how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that are happening North Dakota this week yeah\nMembers include not checkout trail on her house race yeah their\nMeal walking or running partner need a security system needs some entertainment need some apart from the humane society or they'll have to be on those things but you have to adopt one part but you may not be allowed to have to open for adoption for seven days a week Monday through friday eleven to fix Saturday and Sunday eleventh divide\nAmong over you knew that friend is waning at forty nine Ninety One credit will then be part of the solution with the humane society of al ... the\nBiggest risk we just we walk\nAsked every rock and roll lovers is Sandy ... let's take a trip back to this week in rock and roll history\nBecause we can Nineteen Seventy five Paul Simon issues his board solo album still crazy after all these years gone it lasted fifty ways to leave your lover and the title track all reached the U.S top forty and the album hit number one\nDiamonds first album to do so emancipated from Simon and Garfunkel fans finally\nStopped shouting where's the party at his shows\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy six Chicago started a two week running number one on the U.S singles chart which if you leave me now it was the group's Eighteenth south forty hit but its first number one it went on to win the Grammy Award for best pop vocal performance\nThis week in Nineteen eighty seven Michael Jackson started a two week run it number one on the U.S singles chart with bad\nThe music video for bad directed by Martin Scorsese and co starring one of the first two parents as of yet undiscovered Wesley Snipes was released later in Nineteen eighty seven\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three time magazine put any better on the cover with the headline all the rage both veteran Kurt Cobain refused to speak with the magazine for the story\nBut they rented anyway in an attempt to explain why young people are listening to such angry use it and this week in two thousand\nThree in the middle of their first world tour and flush with fame from their debut album Evan essence founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band\n[noise]\nThere's your look back at this\nMay have an uncomfortable step for you one in nine men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer one night in fact prostate\nCancer the second leading cause of death than American men that hurts to hear but you know a dozen there is a simple blood test your own doctor can give you to see if you were at risk and this bloodshed and he called the day is definitely\nNot a pain in the bus to get don't waste your time ... around the Internet to find out more about this jets go to the sea of not over over all the info on prostate cancer prevention do to PCS dot org today\nRaasch morning said Gen news radio sticky Ninety J.

Boulder thrown through the window of of Kevin McCarthy's office\nMitch McConnell has alluded to come up to his table just eating in a restaurant with his wife\nGuide banging on his tables stealing stuff from his table throwing it outside creating a scene\nIn a hospital in environment\nDon't see conservatives doing that and so we have this sad tragedy today where we have suspicious packages now
