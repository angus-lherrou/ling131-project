those casualties were confirmed in Florida's Gadsden county not far from where the category for storm made landfall\nAnd we don't know the fates of two hundred eighty people that apparently elected to stay and ride this out\n[noise] yeah and and the problem is you know the communications are still down um you know and if they somehow did survive and we always do you hope that they did ah you know you deal with this ... you deal with the mental um\nAfter effects of it because let me tell you something if you survive a hundred and fifty five now in our hurricane\nOr you're thinking about her for a long time and it's just not only are you trying to survive physically but you're trying to survive the experience mentally and I can tell you anyone is trying to ride out a hundred and fifty five mile an hour storm or something they will never forget it for the rest of their lives\nOne image and I'll let you go on a second year one image is made the biggest impact on you or that you saw role in from the various uh feeds the UC\nOr you can just see that it's it's again it's how far how far inland more water goes um you know I've covered hurricanes are covered it you go uh in in Myrtle Beach South Carolina\nAnd and I think I've told me the story before you you arrive and when the hurricane is ongoing you're just amazed at the water can make it in places that you never think of water is going to make it and I think that's the case with\nWith many hurricanes that make landfall but water really ends up in places that normally you would say it's just too far away it can't make it here and it does and you're stuck I mean ... for us we just kept on going backwards and we just kept on going inland about when you're in a in a home\nOr a house in the wind's blowing a hundred and thirty miles an hour you just can't get out and walk down the street you're kinda stuck\nPaul delegate our chief meteorologist at Fox Thirteen in Tampa Bay with decades of hurricane experience Paul thanks a lot and I hope we're hope we're done with these conversations yeah\nAll right for the season poll thank you Bye bye so pulled only got a Fox in Tampa you know full disclosure long time a personal friend of mine as well as a great a TV personality as well as a certified meteorologist AMA and all you know all the the seals and and everything\nAnd you know he's has a lot of experience you know when you see some of the details here in you know you hear from people along the Florida coast like Mexico beach and you know people that have been able to look in the description is it looks like an atomic bomb went off\nI mean that really does say at all and as you know uh what's already creeping into the conversation is look\nLook what climate change is done\nAt listen folks I'm not denying that the climate changes or the climate is always changed it's been hot or it's been colder I mean the planet has been hotter I mean you can look at the medieval warming period we you know geologist no we know that the planet has been warmer the plant it's been cooler\nYou know you've got a sunspot cycles you've got ... cycles obviously I mean there are a lot of factors now with a\nAnthropogenic or manmade activity I can apply to the heat it up yeah I'm sure the plight of does take on additional he but I you know all these stores here there was the story last week\nJust last week there was a story that we've got the the UN or with a new report out we've got Thirteen Years to stop the the climate warming or else we're doomed Thirteen Years what were they saying my early twenties thirties\n[noise] we're going to be totally doomed\nWell didn't we hear this same scenario I mean Al Gore's movie won an inconvenient truth\nWe adjust years the acting and that was a\nIt was almost one almost two decades ago that was two thousand three two thousand six whenever the inconvenient truth a movie came out from algal but we we've heard this before and I'm not a scientist I Know that there was some scientists that don't subscribe to many do but\nYou know here we are we've got a hurricane activity which has always existed\nAnd now it's oh my God look what man made climate change is doing look at the the horrific effects\nOf hurricane Michael you know you look at some of the stats and and this is where it doesn't quite dry as far as it's manmade or and throw ... gets global warming it's climate change you know members global warming that it became climate change that we've talked about the politics of even a ... the verbiage usage\nBut you know you look at some of the staff here\nAs you look at the ... the cable news coverage and some of these experts and getting on and they're talking about oh yeah if if you don't believe in climate change now well\nYou're a lost cause but then you know then you look at\nThe stats and you know the same cable channels that are putting up a these experts that are saying oh this was clearly climate change that brought about the massive destruction and the the intensification of hurricane Michael but then they put up you know graphics\nThat show that well Michael is only the strongest\nOr as far as windows\nIn fourth place so it's only the fourth strongest as far as wind and then as far as the barometric pressure Michael is in third place so the point is\nThe strongest when recorded was the Labor Day Nineteen thirty five hurricane before they even use names so Nineteen thirty five Labor Day strong a storm a is number one in the wind speed at one hundred eighty five miles per hour clocked wins\nThat was Labor Day Nineteen thirty five\nA Camille Nineteen sixty nine\nHundred and Seventy five mile an hour winds you at ... am drew a the which which at homestead Florida Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety two hundred and sixty five mile an hour winds and then we have Michael in fourth place a just\nA yesterday with a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds but then you look at the lowest barometric pressures Labor Day Nineteen thirty five is still the lowest barometric pressure recorded Nineteen thirty five\nAnd eight hundred Ninety to ... and Camille in sixty nine was nine ordered Michaels in third place at nine hundred Ninety One so it just shows that we've had storms from long ago and also the Eighteen fifty one storm\nI Believe was mentioned as a real devastating blow to the panhandle certainly not very populated back then but it shows these hurricanes they ebb and flow intensities I'll get into a little bit more later on but again\nThis settled science argument that oh it's it's manmade climate change its it's global warming but then you look at stronger storms that were stronger back in the late sixties and in Nineteen thirty five years in the midst of the great depression

idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and the answers and solving problems and the numbers Barrett out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever\nTo never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump's brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and\nTell them well you know it's costing us you know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just walls humiliate publicly any company that

overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies\nAnd when you have thirty two house seats really you know going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nWhile I ... I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down ... up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuffed but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me they're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives\nAnd they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done on regulations have businesses with the economy and they wouldn't want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole having a hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this was this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right in writing Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you've got take away the jobs take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfair will among all voters she has she has a fifty three percent unfavorable among independent women\nThat the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to the house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoug shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups I think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those\nAs somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today though it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in the direction\nOf Kavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of New York I have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that\nI didn't know but if I got\nI got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat hip hop on this not me and it stems cells are streaming service or write to\nMe was when it came to me that they are because that's who they are they the conservative so notice that it's not New Yorkers\nIt's simple no one is Hans within a rifle no one can\nI'm a I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I Know I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina in South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I Am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhen I have an office would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg\nRent I heard it oh yeah yeah I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nTed it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but\nBut I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical\nAnd that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we're basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their lives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republican Doug shown does not want this do you\nDo oh I Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely thought she should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times are good on the radio as you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should be on the edge should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to be not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if you believe in secure borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh home or all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYep you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes ... you'll have open borders you won't have security\nTo earth you are you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue in Kenya to open ... concern in your neighbor morning\nRemember reading that check out a trio haunted house race there\nOver the past fifty years Moore mentors have helped more than ten million small business owners the for free\nStarting business can be incredibly confusing score really helped me through the course\nWhatever the business there's a score mentor that has the experience I Know how to help you reach your goal scorer mentors\nAre serious business experts\nWhether you're a start up or an existing business [noise] Gore can provide the perspective ... vice that ensures that\nMarsh corn rupture strum tremendously helpful [noise] mark my personal\nScores a nonprofit organization where we provide free business consulting services to people who want to start a business oriented\nAre you starting or growing a business [noise]\nBe one of the next ten million small business group helped for free or\nGet your free business mentor word out or\nAngie merged up relaxing tensions with the U.S the two countries plant in the next month next week another batch of earnings reports will reach investors as well as the latest us retail sales figures Netflix shares picked up six percent after city group upgraded to stock Netflix reports earnings on Tuesday\nActivision Blizzard drove gains in gaming shares after releasing a new version of call of duty subway is trying to get out of a sale slump with a plan to bring it sandwiches to you to partnerships with grub hub door dash ... each and post mates Martin ...
