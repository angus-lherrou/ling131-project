free number is eight hundred nine four one Sean if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein for people that did wrong in the D. O. J. face consequences\nRegarding fights that well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he was talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a ...\nIt is not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting with Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council\nMember James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he ... quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and the cable is saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a cave and that's Lisa Page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or remember then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story ladies' ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here\nAre the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like let Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the ...\nWell it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all was was the ... a recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nIf there was one other event that occurs and that may timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... just after market may they still had or wherever you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that rose to see a a Medicaid\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather eat can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI was brought into the wrong track record talk about history his book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft correct look at this we have had access to eating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThat says that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue\nPower hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jerry why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein action\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing\nTheir power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence\nIn support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devon newness and said oh I was misunderstood and now in his attempted coup\nThe president of the evidence indicates he is saying oh I was misunderstood it was my

three separate high ranking FBI deal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the ... say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it bigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department and the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week they broke the law firms Perkins Kuwait that's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC bottle\nMoney so it would look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went

was not corroborated it was disseminated on all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to

services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call you do you have\nI could go down and see somebody at three AM\nMorning if you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model the day of duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy think tank because doctors never seemed to be at the table when they were having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have this conversation\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida the practice of any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create obstacles stocks lesson huh ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism a and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWater ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the other products so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm an ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from our coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care I think the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea I mean I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nIt whether you're pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family member dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or that the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it the what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nOr so at the ... just brought box or expanded access to these major medical plan called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nSo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas empty and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody is priced at the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... Wilson over and not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWell they're gonna have to move out of New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that costs that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take the New York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um you know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills of blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I can and it's about the same price um but\nIt's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden\nSo we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can't\nBuy quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ... was empty and Dr Lee as grows president docks for a patient care

on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past\nWith the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where Democrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic mobile folk kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time we had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and\nWe won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a\nWe may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections as as a dramatic twenty five point shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nShow I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced and wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal so all of this is in jeopardy damned bonds you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host at a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ... end up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me to think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he'd been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how on a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls\nTo make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWell I didn't like Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there's no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nFuture yeah and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut as Greg can tell you most of these cases that are very important to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the

and many people that I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if the wrong sometimes it is if you find out this entity incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature did this you know it was signed up for David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person wearing that what you are presenting\nThe court is true and that you know it to be true and I'm affirmed that to be true well that didn't work out what the third renewal buys an application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller and now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there is no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein\nThat he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nThe hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one",
