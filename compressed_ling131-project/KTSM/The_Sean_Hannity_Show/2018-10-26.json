Paso\n[noise]\nSaid it was radio I'm Brian Chuck New York's Time Warner center is being evacuated due to a report of a suspicious package it's the second time in two days the building has been put on alert the FBI is focusing on a postal facility in South Florida in its massive bomb scare investigation\n\nSo Florida I'm Wondering if they've narrowed down I was trying to think what what point did it I mean could it be post marks\nBecause some of the packages you could see a post mark or a partial posed Mark I'm wondering if they have enough of a post Marc people to see the ZIP Code of origin Asian where it was canceled a et cetera but I'm Wondering if\n\nAnything as far as the return address the Debbie Wasserman Schultz if that some kind of clue there on how quickly she got the package where it was male ... I don't know\nI'm just wondering how they've decided on Florida is a potential lead on where these packages could have been male as it doesn't mean that the bombers from Florida bomber could be from\nSomewhere else build the bombs in driving and mail them from a location I mean all these are tricks to try to throw people off the trail\nI was there's a lot to talk about today eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on the program radio listeners TV viewers wherever you are would love to have the on the program eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine that we can talk about the conspiracy theories we can talk about you know the the false flag suggestions which again I'm not subscribing to any of this\nI'm going to wait for the investigation there is going to be a troll re treasure trove of details and information and evidence\nWe talked yesterday about as simple as the scotch tape\nThe scotch tape that was used to fix these laser printer or a check in jet print addresses and return addresses looked like it was printed on you know normal you know copy bond and then\nYou know cut out ... and to our rectangles and then placed on to them and they'll ah padded novel ups and then just taped me any game a finger nail or skim pieces hair\nOr you can be DNA evidence under the tape or the forever stamps which I pointed out yesterday that those look like those American flag forever stamps\nOr who knows fingerprints any kind of DNA um components I mean if if ten bombs were sent you've got for instance ten of these digital clock timers\nWhere to someone get Kennedy are they all the same so all the components if there was repetition and components\nIs someone gonna be able to say Oh yes some guy bought nine of these are Kennedys or twelve of these clocks and at a hardware store electronics place or a ordered online yeah there's just so many avenues of investigation I Can't even think of all the possible avenues but I think that they're going to figure out\nWho this is\nFairly shortly that's my guess I see already on hold we have a caller that says that he thinks I'm wrong that the purpose is going to be found All right hey I I Want to get into all of this a lot of detail here I'll give you the the ten bombs now there are two new recipients\nAre confirmed today that receive the these bomb packages I'll get to that momentarily I've got audio I Want to play President Trump at the rally last night is getting some attention speaking of the president the president tweeted out\nOr not about the bombing something unrelated this is regarding the caravan and then I just want to give you a little breaking caravan news and then we'll go back to the the the package bombs being sent\nThe president tweeted out literally a forty minutes ago\nAt two thirty one pm eastern time today the twenty fifth of October\nOr from at real Donald Trump's Twitter account the president tweeted\nTo vote was in the caravan turn around we are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing\nExclamation point\nI don't have a problem with this week this week is up\nOn the money what what is wrong with this to those are the caravan turn around we're not letting you and you're not coming into the country illegally what is wrong with this week I Want any president\nObama well unless we played that Obama audio from when he was a senator\nTalking about we won't tolerate the illegal ah migrations into this country and you know come to this country the correct way we have the old bond and a Trump that green tweeted this Obama audio from 'em before he was president so when he was a senator what oh six oh seven whatever was [noise]\nAnd ah the president's a hundred percent right [noise] with this particular tweet also we have a\nDetails about James Mattis or to send troops to Mexico border over immigrant the caravan\nOf the latest now on this from a very as wire services as at\nLeast eight hundred US troops\nWill be sent to the U.S Mexico border in response to this caravan which\nIs in some reports have the caravan at fourteen thousand now as it's it's like one of those cartoons snowballs going downhill we got all kinds of voters and houses and arms and legs hanging on his thing and the second migrant caravan was over a thousand strong we heard about you know a traipsing through a a Guatemala\nSo took care of ads that they could emerge to make us so far caravan\nSo uh we'll get a tip more detail on this later on during the course of the program the bombs [noise]\nWe have\nTen devices at this point\nSo we know about the Clintons got a device in chapter ... in Westchester County New York and a\nFairly bill was home Hillary was not there I don't think they spend too much tied together a\nSo one bomb to the Clintons the Obamas got the bomb and the device at the end of course the Clinton package was intercepted the Obamas a package was sent to the Washington home also intercepted so Clinton's Obama's Maxine Waters\nUh she received two packages or they were to address the her Maxine Waters one was intercepted at the Capitol Hill a congressional mail center a that was in Capitol heights Maryland so far off campus for them\nAnd also in Los Angeles oh Maxine Waters recipient of two we had of course the Eric Holder package which then was on deliverable and apparently I I think that was due to insufficient postage\nOr miss address one of many insufficient postage and I and I have a picture of that or so and that package to Eric Holder was them sent back to the center which the bogus a spoof\nA return to sender turned out to be a Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm Sorry Schultz a and her sunrise Florida office we know that the original package went to George Soros his house they believe that was handled liver and they find the courier find out who drop this thing off\nA we have of course the John Brennan\nAddressed package which then was delivered to CNN they also think that was curry it over and that of course cause the evacuation of uh the CNN New York headquarters an old time Warner center and that was the big mess yesterday and then the two new packages are as follows Robert Deniro\nGot a package at his uh try Becca film production office in fry Becca lower Manhattan just you know below canal tried that can mean the triangle below canal so that's when that package went and\nI'm One of his uh security person ah found that suspicious and I called NYPD early this morning like five AM and they responded and then a Joe Biden the recipient or addressed\nThe Joe Biden to packages and a one package was intercepted in Wilmington, Delaware the other package in New castle Delaware so that makes a total of ten how many more are out there that's the question\nNow again there's just so many little details that I find fascinating and interesting we'll get into those so why a\nRobert Deniro could be at some of the nasty remarks\nThat that Robert De Niro made regarding President Trump's 'cause it appears that you have a lot of these people are critics were outspoken against the president\nAnd it is is is it a right wing young not sending these or is it a Democrat sending it to Democrats to make it seem like who knows again I'm not sure if the guinea conclusions but we do know that the people that are vocally against Trump\nSome of these people have received these packages and that brings me to Robert De Niro and some of his audio ...

Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners

that we proactively take steps to ...\nTaxed on those who have come under attack by listening to a little bit of the pressure I Want to grab some phone calls here at a moment eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you're on hold hang on I'll get to momentarily eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nSo some are pointing fingers at President Trump that oh it's his rhetoric gets his style as his bashing of the news media and a bashing of some of these critics of his that's a phone meant to this uh this violence or the the mailing of these packages\nCome on like the first of all I Am I happy with all of a Trump's rhetoric and when he gets into bully mode I'm not happy and I I tell you about it on the program\nI'm happy with a lot of the components of the job he's doing but not always you know the the rally mentality and and you know the seeming to\nPut a stamp of approval on the body slamming instead of a gene for the and the and the the reporter the the congressional candidate ... up in Montana I I don't think that's helpful\nI Wish that the president I Wish Trump would refrain I'm Sorry I don't give a seal of approval to everything President Trump says it does\nI like a lot of what he's doing but I Will tell you when he's crossed the line here but let me be very clear even with his ramped up rhetoric there is only one person to blame for these packages and is the bomber\nIn is practically no bombs exploded so are they a bomber or just a bump manufacture and I'm a lame bomb manufacturer or is it intentional who knows there are so many questions to be answered but again\nThis is not Donald Trump's fault this is the bombers fooled must be one hundred percent clear the only person responsible is whoever is assembling and mailing and targeting these individuals with\nThese packages done that's it\nWith that said what I like the president to be more civil and delivery of course I Want but it's all the way around it's the president it's the pundits it's the rhetoric gets the media it's it's it's everything but it doesn't justify somewhat mailing out ten packages at this point and the big question is how many more remain\nHow many more of these packages are still floating around\nSitting somewhere in a pile of male or\nI Would imagine that the\nPostal workers are now or I got to believe that there are pictures of what these packages it looked like and mail facilities all over the u._s. to alert people to look out for this particular package\nData here but I I Do not have any doubts about things I think are totally possible here\n\nAnd just going to have to stick with me here in trust my my instincts on on being patient is going to be all kinds of time next week or whatever when this stuff continues to break in\nWhatever all happens [noise] um I I I appreciate the call I Know what you're saying Susan over half of America gets more in a welfare than it pays in tax I should save this for next week you realize these this is the congressional budget office numbers more than half\nOf Americans receive more in some kind of government transfer payment Medicare medic aid food stamp\nSocial Security then they pay in federal taxes more than half\n[noise] one thing that this explains why so many people don't think tax cuts are a big deal\nIf your life\nIs dependent on all kinds of government transfer payments welfare whatever you want to call it and tax cuts you think are going to lead to the government having less money than you're not going to be in favor of tax cuts uh we've got half over half of America gets more and welfare than they pay in taxes\nThey're gonna understand here that tax cuts and I remember all the news stories about how the Republican tax cut bill didn't end up being that big a boon\nFor the Republicans in polling that's a major shift just since the Nineteen eighties there was a huge win win for Republicans back in the eighties and I think it still is to a certain extent but not as big Frank and not in New Baltimore Welcome sure your Nextel up\nA rash thanks for taking my call you bet\nJust real short here I think Mr ... dupe number one number two the van was set up\nPeriod I think if there's anybody\nWhat do you mean to do what do you mean to do\nThat he was shut up by other people and or a ... there's other people that are helping to do all send all those things across the country which would be my last point\nIs that if there's anybody that thinks that man could have been initiated and follow through with all those mail bombs across the country on his own I think are delusional\nAnd that that that ban was just just a a set up just to a so CNN and MS LSD could ah swallow it and they did hook line and sinker\nSo when you say when you said do do you mean that the Democrats or somebody found this guy and are setting him up and he doesn't have any idea what just happened to him or that he has been can convince to play along and be a part of it which do you mean\n[noise] a little bit of both um\nWe'll find out in the future I'm sure it will wait that we we will we will we find out you said I'm sure we'll find out and we'll wait hopefully

still being we're up to do that he was persuaded do you think he was persuaded to take the fall if he was a dupe\nMm yes okay All right well well I I I'm Sorry what\nIs that what you're saying I think

I mean Congress on contract so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats if Locy become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nJust split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house I think of the committees that are going to change [noise] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the\nWith the ah with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll\nGo check his taxes the leak all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election all you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think don't shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing ... that are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he is right to say that\nThe Democrats are mobilized and focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret\nIt's not so much Donald Trump set is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition\nIn a district gun absolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical ... sets of Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC as putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered\nDelivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four in September that have we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michel was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nFar ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some save the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh Democrats their National Committee to to want the ... that money needs to find his way into the into\nThese top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week\nAnd you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell they're shot a power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there\nAnd we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think both sick are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats when the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... good luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the way to look for um a dumb I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters that and say\nPrompts responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa blame the Democrats\nCan we focus on our national or\nOur borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan worry\n... building the wall and having a crap away the\n... okay so that I Am sort of old trucker offered that deal to the Democrats they do and I would have dreamed it in a heartbeat why didn't that was\n... because I was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that no heartbeat I think it makes sense ah ... in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate
