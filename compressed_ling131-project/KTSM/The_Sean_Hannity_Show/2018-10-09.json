better off today than it was two years ago\nIs America stronger than it was two years ago is the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people\nWe know that on the issue of the tax cuts while he's kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation these kept his promise on building the wall hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced a bolt bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to\nFund the wall in our record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty years the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lowest African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for\nAsian Americans also record low for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea\nSanctions in Iran are now paying off we see the Iranian economy about tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards\nTo that President has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building those Dakota pipelines or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are the good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think\nNancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation\nNobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people what are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts of working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally undo\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit remember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history\nWe know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice when she deleted subpoenaed emails\nAnd then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction but of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company\nAnd told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in May of twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing\nAnd then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nMan that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nNow the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James cone may\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group\nThat they went out and hire the former am I six agent or the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and in in Iraq at Torrey and Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the de OJ or either resigned or fired or\nOr stepped aside\nAnd anyway stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for about Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's done in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI official sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the price of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D O D J and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes she was on with Maria berets aroma I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice we're doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the Pfizer warrant to snoop on Trump's campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the size of warrants\nBy um Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without a Hillary's embalming here\nThey wouldn't have been a fight the application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS

like it could hit landed a category three uh and there was a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined\nFor Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and being I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decades how bad is\nIt so I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record Panama City or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane and the goal what a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that animosity area\nNow the fortunate thing is if we want to cover the a sort of the silver lining here that's the ... and ... are going to get\nFourth wins and mobile I don't think this is a big deal immobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThan weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember Shawn last time I was with you I said I'll I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing what does it mean to look the average person including me has no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm matter\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the uh western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency\nIt's maps came out and said look out October fifth through about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely\nAnd I said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like a good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to cap on ... or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto we hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming west northwest it's hitting\nIt's hitting in the classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nIn a lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is gonna be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right out to sea to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't hit the ... you'll see forty to sixty

I'm going to real\nWell we've got thirty seconds in our time to get into another subject carrier Mr I'm miserable which I'm I'm pretty dead but I Do think it's interesting that you you discovered it and we couldn't get it right away like all the other ... ... we had to wait until the final report\nRight now we're to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred nine four one shown if you want to\nBe a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong and the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding ... well he signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell former FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe\nRemember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid and the FBI lawyer that\nWas assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was a real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI I remember that you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThat sort of just in that timeframe around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress\nAnswer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon is an investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated we've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein\nJust before that we had people like ... Lisa Page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all was was the dot CA recycled in different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah dishes leave taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nWell if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from just after market may they still have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and once the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that roses have a a McKay and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather eat can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with hot in the theater I'm sure record talking about the history book lays out a real possibility that this was a soft crew right look at this we have the FBI to eating a crime here that\nFact they can't find a crime by a page\nHas all these well at least ... pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThis isn't the drama the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John of the group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president of United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power and the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious because the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was dead\nSerious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing claims oh I was misunderstood\nBulldogs professional cleaning at nine one five six nine four forty six forty three liked him on Facebook six nine four forty six forty three dogs professional cleaning\nA meal walking or running partner need a security system needs some entertainment meets a pen from the humane society other types of can be all those things but you have to adopt one first but you may sidey I'll have to open for adoption seven days a week Monday through friday eleven to fix Saturday and Sunday eleventh divide\nAmong over your new best friend is waning at forty nine Ninety One friend will soon be part of the solution with the humane society of El Paso\n...

get cancer or the God Forbid I got in a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last eight ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled more we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility at Seventy in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call you do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the E R but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty\nDoctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care bound nation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician on health policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in back of the tabletop conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create a ... tour you know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWe're seeing some inbound medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it for all and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nWondering ensuring if using insurance drives up the cost of the product so ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars\nWhile using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it authorized\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\n... solution so I'm pleased to see the the you know we're shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that you're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on this topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nHe whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm because people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay a for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician their heads and California is to send them on a ridge analogy this throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you actually looking at ways that are fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nOr so something mental stretching just brought blocked or expanded access to these major medical plan it's called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas MD and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nThat everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ...
