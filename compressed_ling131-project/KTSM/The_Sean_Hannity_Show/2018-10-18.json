quickly\nThank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they yeah they're dominating the news surface all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a bunch of competing\nConservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say\nWell I don't have the concert at station where I live\nWell we'll see are you going to go on how about the art TV you checked she our TV\nYou can check Newsmax dot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think

Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith

Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your own Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except what I refer to is the mainstream media where people don't have the ... and ... they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the facts they don't want for conservative is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen ... money controls everything if CBS or ABC said\nFrom top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system\nWe're going to have conservative viewpoint on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing say at CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively\nModerate to the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars\nBecause you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news cast every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and wouldn't they make a lot of money\nWell where are the people that are being\nWe'll call active enough to do that to get into the mainstream and say these radio shows and he's TV 'cause they're faking to the choir we need to change minds like Hyundai starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go they are\nYes and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now Marshall of Ben May get them on on Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut but he needs to go out

this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like the messiah it's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four\nPretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida he'd go anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir went to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nOne step he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a cooking by the act stupid you know and this is off the subject but I said well irony in the end is because they're starting to accusing him of going after young prosecute is its competitor and why is he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nI tell I tell you what's unfair criticism when you picture our first lady as a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office and the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around my lawyer to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was\nPictured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office what would the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWell where's the high there is none because the Trump is Mrs Trump that

to guess what is that sound on a very serious note here that the show he thing I Want to open up phones early on ... and the situation that we're in here in the United states\nWith our allies the Saudis I reluctantly called them allies because\nAlways been suspicious of the Saudis I still am suspicious of the Saudis\nThere an amount of nine eleven conspiratorial is at all but there's more inside the Saudi royal family with a knowledge to nine eleven that I truly believe and also remember in the nine eleven commission report\nWe have all of that stuff regarding Saudi Arabia and the Saudi royal family and there's an absolute monarchy this autocracy or redacted\nThat'd be nice a big black lines that are are blacked out and with the Saudis a lot of stuff was just blocked down so what is it that we're not allowed to see regarding the Saudis I've always thought that they were\nA very um\nKnow what have you done for me lately or or very fair weather up there on our side on some things\nOther things I think that the uh the kingdom kingdom\nA has clearly a diligently and horrifically works worked against the United states and our interests so it's it's it's a bizarre relationship I was never comfortable with George W Bush's relationship with the Saudis\nAh the proper relationship it seems to be along the same lines as George W Bush's relationship I just I've never trusted the Saudis but this is a very bizarre\nGruesome and difficult very complicated matter in the sense that the Saudis are good acting as a check to\nThe out of control terrorists in Iran and the mullahs the Ayatollah Khomeini et cetera are the Saudis or a very good checks\nTo the Iranian power imbalance in the region\nSo I Do have a question for you I Want to get into the details here more a little odd and ... and the nuggets are coming out about the show the but the question I have for you the Schmidt audience if you're watching us on Newsmax television if you're listening to us on nationwide Schmidt affiliate radio my question to\nYou is if the Saudis were completely involved\nAnd executed this American resident empty I mean he had a green card as a permanent us resident ... living in the Washington DC area writing for the Washington Post as a columnist\nHis kids are American citizens from everything I've read\nOr what should the Trump Administration do so very clearly if the Saudis killed because show he\nWant Shaun the Trump Administration do\nDo we look the other way and this is complicated because of the Iran factor because of the oil factor and yes the Saudis if they want to get nasty and belligerent\nThey can rock the world oil market no doubt about it they can say even though we're on the the biggest producer of oil right now or last I saw the Saudis and their influence at OPEC they can obviously move the needle which would be painful to us the United states you me\nAt the gas pump the question though is if the Saudis killed his show you folks\nIt's looking like they did this looks like a a Keystone cop a really bad elimination scheme gone really really wrong\nAnd a total miscalculation that's what this looks like\nSo you know my bet is is that they try to rub ... they want the rub him out and they were successful in robbing them out that the Saudis at the direction of NBS that's a Mohammad bin ... he's the crown prince\nThat his goon squad and we even have names and faces attached to him and his top level security that flew in ah folks I I don't think trust me it's a much better bet than these losing mega millions tickets that I have right here a much better bet that the Saudis\nRubbed out ...\nAnd not even fathom it not even having a clue that it would explode into this international come full of grace\nIn this incident of humongous proportions in which the world is horrified and what appears to be an official state sanctioned hit a nasty when you hear the details and we've been talking about this for a couple of days but my question to you is\nFor radio and TV viewers and listeners the question is what should the Trump Administration do if it is absolutely proved that our ally Saudi Arabia\nMurdered assassinated completely Rob without a U.S resident not a citizen but a resident alien or a permanent resident of the United states wants the Trump Administration do\nA eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's the nationwide number and as I told you yesterday I told you just a five minutes ago\nThat cause show these kids are American his kids are you as citizens\n... house and the Trump Administration I Want you to be ah my palm paleo I Want you to be secretary of state where I Want you to be a Trump Administration advisor ... what would you suggest what would you tell the president what do you want to see President Trump do if it is\nAbsolutely proven that the Saudis murdered his Yogi\nThe number's eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's how you get in will grab some calls coming up and just have been so the latest details are that secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nAnd the president's they appear to be given Saudi Arabia well a lot of latitude here\nGiven Assad is a lot of leeway as this investigation into the mystery is disappearance of ... as it rolls on now the Turkish are getting frustrated\nThe Turkish they see and that's what I I uh I've got major issues with or to God and turkey and uh I don't even think they should be a NATO that's a whole different story we've talked about\nThe problems with turkey as well a fair weather or playing both sides of the fence a non not supportive of many of the of our US interests which are bizarre because they are on a NATO\nOr an ally and there are a member of NATO or but anyway the Turkish they're getting frustrated and they're looking at what they think is at least\nAn aura of ambivalence on the part of the Trump Administration\nAre now in all fantasy her\nWhere is the proof it's looking like the Saudis did kill the show he bought a as Trump said maybe a little to fill up and leave with the Associated Press where he told they told the a P A quote here we go again where if you\nAre guilty until proven innocent I don't like that\nI was I I agree with the premise that yeah you're you're innocent until proven guilty\nOr give us the facts give us the details that what we don't know is behind the scenes if the Turkish\nHave already provided us and tell or the White House or Mike Pompeo a with a details did they play this alleged audio recording for my palm pale when he was in Turkey after we left Saudi Arabia with the smiling creepy crown prince and the and the the er the\nKing gave me a break [noise] so the Turkish you're getting a little frustrated here and ah\nYou know they claim to have this audio and video evidence of the murder now where is it are they going to provide and again proof is necessary here uh you got to have the ... I agree with the president on that so there are very specific details that are coming out\nFrom the alleged audio of this execution and folks the details as we told you we have some of the details yesterday or they're ghastly\nI mean they are gruesome Graham ghoulish a will for all the ... words that I mean it's really some nasty stuff here\nAnd the Turkish are concerned that we the United states are essentially aiding the Saudis in a cover up\nHe's associate [noise]\nIs a very complicated situation because as I said the the Saudis acting as a counterbalance in the region to\nThe terrorists government of Iran and\nMost of the the Saudis\nAre not smell like Rosie's roses most of the time as well but you know it's sort of the the lesser of two evils\nAnd again it's it's been a very fascinating real relationship to say the least again with the salaries and I believe much more knowledge or maybe not the highest levels of the royal family but certainly with the large royal family\nWithout a doubt a there was more knowledge of nine eleven and the hijackers\nThen we were told that I'm not a conspiratorial is uh I just have always been very suspicious of the Saudis now with Jamal ... oh you have the economic issues an oil obviously in Iran it's just it's really just a a big giant messier now with the show he though you know this individual doesn't\nThe the the the the proverbial clean his hands of all I've read numerous pieces about his friendship and high school with Osama bin Laden doesn't mean that he was tied to nine eleven but\nUh and you know talk of a a Muslim Brotherhood connections of Jamal cause Yogi wasn't even if all that is true\nAnd for instance here here's a here's a blurb from front page magazine or in high school ... show he had a good friend his name was Osama bin Laden we're hoping to establish an Islamic state anywhere 'cause show he reminisced about their time together in the Muslim Brotherhood and\nA lot of folks regarding onto that that while he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and well he deserve to die a lesson I I'm Still concerned it didn't appear that show he was involved in any activity a detrimental to the U.S in his later life or really for that matter\nAnything directly or impactful and the negative nature to the United states are but some are trying to say oh he was a Muslim Brotherhood member so well he deserved I\nI don't think we can [laughter] I don't think we can jump on on that oh by the way I Am funny ah from Kansas City who I Try to grab just before the break\nHe was there and apparently he couldn't hear me or something with the phones let me try to bring up Anthony here quickly Anthony in Kansas City Missouri can you hear me now\nI can hear it out I was a\nVery very ... like you say that again I Want to prime the pump 'cause all the lines are jammed because I've asked the question if it is prove that the Saudis rub out this show gay guy what should the Trump Administration do and on my screen or hear it says you think we do nothing\nI Would say do absolutely nothing no surprise that keep them married to the dollar deal that you've made when he was on air coming in the United states offer\nLike so what if they kill the U.S resident that's\nKiller you as president that would be a different story that they\nDon't have to retaliate but wait a minute but not all of my mother won't won't all\nMonitoring well well\nEvery ... every show he was a U.S resident\nOf out of bed of\nA ... I said I said resident he could show he was\nGetting karma\nCars so he was on the show he was a U.S permanent resident he was not a citizen but his kids always got four kids that apparently all us citizens because they were born here so us resident\nOr you you certainly do nothing even if he was a resident so I Do mean sending federal a resident\nOf the road that runs collateral damage to the camera and keep our workers working they got a lot of money I Love camping prominent for the United states offered\nA ... and that's what I saw\nI saw his own K.

is that the New America because I didn't I don't remember that\nThat certainly the America will desperate left because they're losing\nUh the more they lose the more desperate they get and it's good I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a Neal is the violence a which in the end I think turns people off it's it's it's it's it's also a little scary because this is Steve ... proved when he was shot um [noise]\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watched the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYeah I think look I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing of America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and is often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo\nAnd the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments uh and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to the Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and the and I think that just further isolates come\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cut history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want to open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because uh if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think and I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by US Senators incentive meetings\nI think all that came together to really re galvanized conservative and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein pillow see San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala only four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage that Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between health care education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she doesn't want any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party they'll the galaxy the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win with legal American votes and so it's got to try to find some way to turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch developed\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen
