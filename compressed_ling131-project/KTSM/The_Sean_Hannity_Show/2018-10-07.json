I'm\nSure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed by\nThe Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that at every Democrat that it's now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible partisan organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear jokes that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse to discount discount them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does commanding incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walked to fourteen different times he found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nThey are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk a part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it\nYou know the parents to draw to reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but that would be I ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAs their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that that somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as ... as\nWell make that can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals but that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know\nRight before this whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer was telling people she's not even sure it with him she said well how did he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain to get hit it sounds so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New Yorker 'cause they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her\nI I I'm I'm impressed there even counted as a credible allegations of the you know what go for the FBI can talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly getting a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to

him getting out to your show so\nAppreciate it you know cross fire was\nThe defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show at its time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and uh doing the things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one first will work conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power\nTo investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witness was being coaxed ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public and we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared

Ford's planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh advocacy world one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict that the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nDoing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers beyond doubt I\nDoubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nOh it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a Baptist I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it will change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short or less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong\nI Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nA ...

radio I'm Rob Sadler Senator Chris Coons beliefs impeachment hearings into Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh would be premature\nThere's only ever been one justice that's been impeached and I think talking about it at this point I'm isn't necessarily killing us and moving forward\nThe results are now in polling and we're seeing it in the Fox news poll that now shows that are Heidi Heitkamp who is a no on judge cabin on North Dakota's she's down by eleven it's going to be interesting to watch what Joe Manchin does Joe Donnelly in Indiana is a no\nUh we know Claire McCaskill is a no we a have a battle going out Martha ... I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller of Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nThese numbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy is simple that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nThat it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races down a dead heat\nIn all of the states that the red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to go further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine and they lost\nAnd I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process\nYou may well have crippled his party for a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me I just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this what certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know it's rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever the vista nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eyewitness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he's just kind of decay into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about having your Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance has a history teacher founded painful uh he he makes comments like that I mean here\nShould know that if allegations destroy you are then the whole process of the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive Porsche and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment of fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of this election I have as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think this could be\nOne of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush\nTo oil behind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the book both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek hippie happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm not I'm not quite ready yet to project but am on to tell you that because of the intensity of anger\nAbout the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our or the total number of senators by significant
