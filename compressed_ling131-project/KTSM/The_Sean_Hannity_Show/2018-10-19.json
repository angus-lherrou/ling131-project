filling in and I go ahead\n[noise] hey band thanks for having me on my uh uh really enjoy your show hey thank you had a quick question I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but [noise] ... from a logical standpoint let us know a few years ago Mr Obama filed\nFederal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the fault her purview of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument\nWell no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce the immigration laws some of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's whenever they don't ... people need to understand about liberal\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean that there can millions you liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for piracy\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day and doing the complete opposite the next day\nMay ...\n... is the part where I'm confused as is if is what the court to who sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of ... the system stuff like this yet those same courts are\nReality they're decisions don't stand ...\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years\nIt was a when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick it and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with his bed to race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nOh absolutely absolutely and and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never gonna win California well if you can turn\nTexas to the Dems for the Dems those three states\n... it's virtually impossible to do math that makes it where Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just get the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you've got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way by the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentator she was just on MSNBC deadline White House\nAnd she had some very insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal of the day with some great advice and analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nHe's doing that that scare every journalist

that's coming to to a head I mean barring a disaster I mean it only is is it's like the winds me of Obama in the sense that he's cool obeyed or Rourke\nIt's it it is eight out side Texas phenomenon not attacked it only by the way this is New York DC\nThing this is the San Francisco LA thing he gets a full hour on fake news CNN he can't even gone to a million viewers\nThat's all that's not just taxes that's the whole country\nYou know we could have put it on short wave radio and TV he could've done a Facebook wife short Twitter live show and done better than a million\nAnyway so you know then you know Texas by the way we have some examples there of people asking non citizens to register to vote that's now becoming a big problem down in Texas oh by the way even MSNBC held paid or rock as a rock star you can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong\nThat want to get to the southern border where the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government\nThat that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what if they resist that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him\nSo they'll fly from Mexico\nInto the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful or the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that has been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want to Ninety One\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex Rick Scott has killed himself and on such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane he's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you don't want them a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be asked to talk a good game and just they're lying to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy that's why project very tossed catching reticent on tape\nAnd his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support capital you not support cab and he's not going to\nBe but [laughter]\nI just can't believe that even actually yeah [laughter] and they were still\nLike I don't see much to my mind [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] right um [laughter]\nThe people at Tennessee or ignorant according to the campaign of Phil Bredesen and they're just doing saying what they need to say they get elected to just pick up all the same thing Claire McCaskill's expose doing the same exact thing\nAnd then you think she's more progress and then she left on the game or a game [laughter] [laughter] so a lot more or less what might those there's a lot\nMore radical than what she says oh there's a story that just broken Claire McCaskill is going to be problematic go see it on Fox News dot com and the headline is her husband is accused ... of abused by his ex wife\nAnyway was reportedly accused of domestic violence and Missouri candidates a Claire McCaskill has been accused of domestic violence and as one company wants to victim blamed a woman who sued for sexual misconduct\nOh I Wonder if she's going to speak out like a I've been waiting for her to speak out on Keith Ellison will keep waiting because we're not going to hear any of it and we got of course ...\nHarris other prominent Democrats they slowly leak out what they want now Maxine Waters revealed that they keep saying they keep telling me don't say it to ... will do it but don't pay about impeachment\nJohn Podesta group saying just don't ever talk about immigration to get off the topic is that they can and and talking about anything else\nBut there's they won't open borders they want sanctuary cities they want amnesty they want sanctuary states they made a political calculation that that's going to benefit them down the road to mellow Harris\nYou know literally and other Democrats are now saying they want their crumbs back they want to repeal the tax cuts\nThat set off the booming economy we haven't seen that setting records\nFor decades and she wants to stop it she wants to replace the tax cuts with cash payouts for the poor and working class well fifty percent of taxpayers in America pay nothing we already have redistribution\nThe crumbs that go to businesses and middle class Americans one two thousand dollars a month it is impacting their lives and creating you know jobs that we thought Warren coming back to America for a million new jobs in Trump's elected\nEight million Americans out of poverty and all for food stamps

see that Brett is and has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee\nThe same with Claire McCaskill we said that Christians cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona or by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha mix Sally\nIs fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so seems a lot of pick up in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida both for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the houses are still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nNow West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up in the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America stands and John and you are right on fortunately I might add is if the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because of his eight\nOperationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those have deteriorated above it from my perspective and the last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah it was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a\nNationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I'm ready on TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf you vote for any Democrat you're voting for a pillow see if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for pastor and McCaskill\nAnd send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know bread on the news just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually paying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats had not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we were told me a bit of a leading Indiana is say a key pies you say go the wall and he's saying oh impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian out of Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we could go in a lot better I think you'd probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible the Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answer on that one is money so so you know raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's\nAll about ... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she closer to speak or didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know the chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a willing all their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so they\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates and let me tell you a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are pouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat in the patio and he's ... Republicans project very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of Claire McCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly\nIt tells me Democrats to when they have to they can expose who they are they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that I mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and then I Hope\nYou are exempt me from being a person\nWill hire them to you but you know nobody's been listening to you because if they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you take that as well as the fact that I mean no on sale radical left so I I'm I'm a center right\nListen I your your style a Democrat listen
