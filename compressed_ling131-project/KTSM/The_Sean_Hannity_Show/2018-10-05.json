conclusion of the FBI investigation\nWe have the report now being viewed that listen if if I were to criticize something here and I think this is fair to criticize one element here is the fact that only one copy has been available for the senators to see both Republicans\nAnd Democrats and what has happened is a little bit of a log jam in the senators that want to go view this in this skiff this a sensitive information room or in a in the Senate building\nIt's a I I Want to suggest have multiple copies inside the skiff\nSo there's one copy and there are some complaints that the time slots to view have filled up in\nA you know some of the senators might not even get to see them till tomorrow afternoon or whatever the story is I I think that I Would have provided multiple copies to get this and again not to leave this you have to have a full accountability for all of the pages\nSo nothing is take is ... is one of the senators were to steal information taken out or I mean I\nDon't know it'd be so lonely as if I'm not mistaken so that would be one criticism should have been multiple copies to get this thing uh in the hands or in the eyes in the hands but you can't take with you are in this a secret facility the sensitive facility I that's one thing I Would suggest a oh\nI thought this was a very and I brought up the voice of Dr Ford and I\nRelate to you on this program that I

J. Smith and mark judge and even her good friend is this legal in Kaiser none of them are corroborating even the one that you would suggest is legal in ...\nWho would suggest oh yeah that happened and she couldn't recall anything\n[noise] I mean they also included in the FBI investigation where Deborah Ramirez she's the second accuser or Tim God debt who's a friend of Kavanaugh among the individuals so initially we had her for names and of course we now know that the FBI ultimately\nInterviewed nine so five more than the original for but still is that good enough for the Democrats no they're betraying and moaning and they're complaining they wanted a a list of twenty three year twenty four and\nThen there are complaints that Kavanaugh was not re interviewed by the FBI and the doctor Ford was not re interviewed by the FBI\nAnd the company I mean we got complaints from that you know sweating that guy who give me a break and then complaints also from the nearest is attorneys which I'm sure we'll get into later on uh\n[noise] I I mean [noise] I mean what what else do you want there's nothing there you know and I think the most significant of today's revelations I think among the most significant is what came out from Susan Collins\nAnd you know Susan Collins a made a statement regarding after she saw the FBI report and then Jeff Flake so what the colon say what the flight say and with what they have said after they view the FBI supplemental here\nSeems that they're going to be yes votes and if they're yes votes that means that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed by [noise]\nAnd we live in some strange times folks are so I don't count on anything these days but it looks like the votes are going to be there for the final vote on Saturday hold on we'll get into that I'll tell you exactly what we're ... accounts you said a\nRoute with columns that rather I'll tell you exactly what Collins I'll tell you where Murkowski said as well so I'll tell you what Collins said I'll tell you what flake said and those those are very important Collins and like and then Murkowski\nA you know she's also she's also talking a little bit and we also know that one of the Democrats could have been a yes is now going to be a no a mansion still up in the hold onto those thoughts a lot of ground to cover\n...

people watch local TV and as such are inundated with political ads and we keep hearing that people are tired of them but they keep running them because of the political consultants believed that they work\nBut this is an area where I don't have a lot in common with with the people in this regard\nAnd it it leads to being a constant frustration for me I Am never influenced by the money spent on the campaign particularly campaign ad didn't that doesn't affect me I Know who I'm going to vote for before I CNN and there's not an ad in the world that's going to make me change my mind\nBut I have to keep in mind how rare that is most people watch local TV they can't avoid all those ads and a lot of people are not\nImmersed than this stuff like\nI Am and maybe you too and so they are influenced by these ads I have to keep reminding myself\nThat these ads and the the spending of a voluminous amounts of money does matter\nI just I have a tough time I see how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now I I folks I really mean it I think\nGiven what we've seen since Trump was elected a Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever\nThis country needs to rise up and reject these people I Know their voters are not going to reject them but\nI don't believe they're the majority I think these people need to be skunk their behavior\nJust in terms of decency common decency these people must not be rewarded for what they're doing destroying people destroying institutions destroying concepts in our rule of law\nI shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff\nYou know it used to be the you know the economy was great just by living through it but now you apparently have to be told that it's good you have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy's good then you have to believe it\nWell I remember a time when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well did you didn't need to be told\nYou know it\nBut now we got the Democratic party out there saying it's not a great economy tax cuts are ruining everything\n[noise] and some don't cost you believe this stuff [noise]\nYou'll you'll reject what you're living and believe what you're being told by ... [noise]\nSo I just I Am I have yet to be influenced by a political ad now I realize I'm very ferment convictions and I know what I Believe but there's not an ad in the world's going to change my mind\nAbout candidates one other thing I get along the lines of what other Democrats going to do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed I told you they're going to double down and they're going to keep harassing and they're not going to stop trying to get rid of this guy I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up I have\nA tweet here actually to from a woman who works at the nation\nShe is I don't know if she's a journalist no she was she does there but the nation as a\nOver left magazine her tweet her name as anti shields I'll go ahead and make her famous\nI Am starting a national at Democrats socialist working group the followed Jeff Flake around to every restaurant cafe store et cetera he goes to for the rest of his life and yell at them\nYou want to see the mob outside Susan Collins is office right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat they oppose John trial nomination up act\nTo the Supreme Court of the United states a number of senators joined them re too and now they're up and says then but they were me to the parents by one of our colleagues who actually and now the opposition\nThe board that no I'm In the age to dance contain what to even know\nSince that time we had seen special interest groups with their followers in to a friend say by spreading misrepresentation and our right fall has a bad judge cabinet judicial record\nAnd just stores up his record and testimony edits first airing produce short lived headlights which also did by our blade or can can you live\nIf on and be spread through social media interest groups have all that was spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination our Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than Thirty years [noise] wine can only hope that the cabin uh ... and it's where the process\nHas finally hit rock\nAgainst\nThis backdrop that it is that to each individual senator to the side what the constitution that advice and consent duty means [noise] informed\nBy Alexander Hamilton federal it's Seventy six [noise] I have interpreted says to me that the president has broad just scratching considerate nominees philosophy whereas\nMy duty yet says senator is to focus on that nominees qualifications as long as that nominees for law and the is within the mainstream of judicial thought\n[noise] I have always the post ... has for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics\nBut I fully expect them to be able to put a side any and all personal preferences in deciding the case the sec come before them\nI never can fit or the president the density or hard and wet enough value waiting Supreme Court nomination as the result\nI voted in favor of Justice Roberts and Alito who were nominated by President Bush\nJustices soda my or end its cage and who weren't nominated by President Obama and justice Gorsuch who was nominated by President Trump [noise] so I\nBegan my evaluation of judge Kavanaugh's nomination by reviewing his twelve year record\nOn the DC circuit court of appeals including has more than three hundred opinions and his many speeches and law review article nice chain turning\nIncluding lawyers from the non partisan congressional Research Service\nFreaks me many times to each week and it says to me\nIn the value waiting the judges extensive record\nI met with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my uh 'cause\nI listen carefully to the testimony up the committee Sherry I spoke with people who knew him personally such as ... sunrise and many out there\nAnd I talked to when judge Kavanaugh as the second time by phones for another hour to ask\nHim very specific additional questions [noise] I also have met with thousands and to my constituents spoke to advocate and many opponents regarding judge Kavanaugh\nOne concern that I frequently hurt was set the judge would be likely to eliminate the Affordable CARE Act and vital protections for people with preexisting conditions\nI just to grieve ... contention in just sent in seven sky beholder judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to be a ca\nOn narrow procedural grounds per serving the law and for\nMany experts have said that hits the fan in foreign Justice Roberts' opinion upholding the A.

current challenge is to be a TA proponents including my self up protection for people with preexisting conditions should want to adjust his who would take just it's kind of approach\nAnother surge and that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if I have to involve ... alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nSaid basis for defense argument seems to be two fold first judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution\nOr civil liability while in office\nMr President I Believe opponents miss the mark on that says to the fact that judge cabinet awkward Vince legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection

on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Collins condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote\nIs concerned and and I I the best part of what she said uh was re county many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate\nThat even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd set in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers no into civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence\nOr and she said it wasn't there there were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any

I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge where the Trump voters a short you know your dog and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday or those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nMaybe I got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked at ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans pulled him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit\nThe Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed\nThese voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother and said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is ... ... is coming back in and Galileo well ... ... that Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWas shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply but I'll give you ...\nYou can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know\nAny sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have is an ongoing leaving the house which I think it can lead to pick up the house and I think from\nWhat I see looking at the Senate races they're all very very close within the margin of her\nAnd I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect narrowly confirmed to see\nWhether the effect job than you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats them from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles or or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play poker I think of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs not going into twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... in sixteen days\nLet's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did it to the man you support us any more disgusting\nAnd I don't believe who like poor experimenting Arlen than things that\nDo you what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they ban with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not you proud of the how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I went up I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal philosophical differences\nWith the judge Kavanaugh I Would not be voted for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of archer judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins\nYou know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nThere's no room for a scoop Jackson they even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoug don't make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Democrats put the late hit on Bush or not Bush part of it they did it to push for the drunk driving but they did it with to Donald Trump with a tape that women are people people weren't right Jordan realized it was a choice between Hillary Clinton\nAnd Donald Trump and they voted for Donald Trump and and this voters in the heartland right now that are engaged we have to keep them engaged over the next four weeks because when we when again and cabinet gets confirmed they can take things are fine now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMayor Bloomberg spring millions of dollars against ... job
