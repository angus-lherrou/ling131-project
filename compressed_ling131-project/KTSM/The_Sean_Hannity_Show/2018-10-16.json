Brian shook President Trump isn't convinced by CNN report that claim Saudi Arabia will soon fess up to accidentally killing a Washington Post columnist during a botched interrogation\nIn Georgia today Trump said nobody knows if those media reports are true the report says Saudi Arabia is preparing to admit that you're a mock show he died during an attempt to a doctor and transport him back to Saudi Arabia\nMany other Americans have more\nNative American DNA than Elizabeth Warren will be fine I mean I I saw this I saw this\nIt might've been on the Drudge Report but I saw this headline about two hours ago and I printed it out it's in my pile but let me see if it's on a [noise] okay see if it's what I see this thing but it's it was it was it a piece that I was reading and I thought I highlighted I probably did\nBut [laughter]\nI'll find it a second but essentially it's that many other Americans who don't claim that they're Native American actually have more Native American in them a van Elizabeth Warren and\nWhen there's something with European European Americans were or Americans with the European descent actually many have more Native American DNA them a Senator Warren but\nI assume I executive producer just said hey Schmitt you probably have more Native American I don't know I've never done one of the twenty three and ... I Know vaguely or basically what my lineages I Know that there's some German there's some Russian woman named Schmidt is German there's Russian is German is from Hungarians polish so\nUh and I know that I'm On my mom's\nI was a family and my dad's side of the family they you know rolled over around the Eighteen Seventy is Eighteen eighties or through a Ellis Island so from from Eastern Europe so\n[laughter] there's there's a chance maybe I could have more Native American [laughter] once led set this whole thing up and I I don't mean to make a\nMockery out of it is yes I Do I don't mean to joke about this yes I Do but I mean if if [laughter] if Elizabeth Warren really thinks that this fear they test which shows her\nAt best at best one\nThirty second Native American but\nEven the experts says that it goes back maybe six to ten generations so going with those mathematics\nSix to ten generations even the Boston Globe's peace said that uh limos Warren is on the long way and only\nOne [laughter] and one thousand twenty fourth one slash one zero one or one zero two for one one thousand twenty four ...\nNative American and by the way the Boston Globe Anna correct themselves then they had to issue a correction inhaling\nActually pretty embarrassing here but the the the original the original a percentage from the Boston Globe piece was that she was one in five hundred and twelve\nNative American and they had to do a correction here looking at a correction due to a math or a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated\nThe ancestry percentage of a potential temp generation relative it shouldn't be one and one thousand twenty fourth\nThey had it at one point five hundred twelve or ah yeah won five hundred and twelve so double it and they they were they ... they had a half wrong so I'd be folks [noise] the experts the expert\nThis bustamante guy he ports Elizabeth Warren's family tree lineage going back\nSix to ten generations and if it's\nTen generations back it means that she's won and won sours in twenty four not a third not a half not an F not sixteenth\nNo one\nOne thousand twenty fourth [noise] ah that's incredible\nThat she really she wants to hang our hat on that this is a proof I mean there is absolutely laughable fights ahead and we get here [noise]\nOh by the way of done some research on Native American DNA requirements which uh I have a whole little [noise] a dust ca than I Want to go over as well you know I'd love to grab phone calls if you are Native American\nAnd what are your thoughts that Elizabeth Warren might have Native American between six and ten generations back\n\nAnd that she claimed that she was Native American\nOn job obligations on job applications and and try to get a professorship incidentally in this documentary they have a whole host of law professor say oh she's the best she's the greatest uh she didn't get the job because of this I mean this is such\nA P R missile that they're trying to write the listing ship on any doubt that she overplay their hand or was fraudulent\nIn her description of her Native American heritage you do this folks when you plan on seeking a higher office was a she's a shoe in obviously from Massachusetts and her Senate seat continuing but this clearly is a rehab attempt at any damage at all\nThat might be a swirling around because of her desire to run for the presidency and seek the Democratic nomination in twenty twenty there's no doubt about it now\nI said we have audio\nI Want to grab your phone calls as well so any thoughts on this Elizabeth Warren's story the timing of this if you've seen the five and a half minute a documentary or wants to give your thoughts on that I've got a couple of audio bites from the documentary I Want to play here and just the bed or if your Native American I mean any\nAspect of this happy to take your calls eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine she has a Tutsi when the\nBetty purple polka dot but TV and a little bitty tiny bit of Native American blood according to the DNA tests which again really [laughter] [laughter] it's\nA it's it's hardly the kind that proportional blood on the line that you would use to try to qualify for everything and we get from it of actions space I mean it's gotta be kidding me here I mean even the Boston Globe\nDocumented wars past controversial claims for their article now let me give me a couple of quotes a on a and from the Boston Globe piece which uh which broke this today ... this quote from the Boston Globe piece which Santa correct because their their numbers were were not\nUh astronomically high enough on how little potential Indian blood she has so that a correct story a aerial quote questions over warns ethnicity have dogs her censored twenty twelve Senate campaign\nThat's one GOP operatives found archival stories in the Harvard Crimson\nOf Harvard law school or the the the the newspaper and it was the Harvard law school spokesperson referring to his Native American and the Harvard across the newspaper I as a way to show that the school had a diverse faculty\nDuring her academic career as a law professor she\nHad her ethnicity change from white ... Native American at the University of Pennsylvania law school where she taught from Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd then a Harvard University law school where she was a tenured faculty member starting in Nineteen Ninety five she was visiting professor at Harvard during the Ninety to Ninety three academic year\nIn an interview with the gold\nPublished last month Warren explained that she identified herself as Native American in the late Nineteen eighties and early Nineteen nineties as many of the matriarch of her family were dying and she began to feel that are family stories in history or becoming lost folks\nThat is a load of crap hold on a sec old I was at DCA hear this sound right here\nEh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh\nThat's the best detector going off that is the Elizabeth Warren BS detector so a couple of excellence she made\nThose claims folks to get hired at these press the just schools that were under intense pressure to diversify the staff and faculty that's what's going on here and well\n[noise]\nWork I mean they they did hire her but at the University of Pennsylvania had to go to great pains to explain why and hired a white woman over qualified minority candidates so obviously they didn't view her as part Native American it sounds like they weren't a you know falling for her her racket\nI anyway we have the analysis from the Boston

resident who\nFor the Washington Post at the Saudis are going to admit that he did die in their custody\nWell that means the facilities they lied to President Trump is President Trump was on the phone with the Saudi king and all we had nothing to do with this well then they uh initially like you know what's happened here folks is the Saudis had no idea that this thing was going to explode into this kind of a story\nThe Saudis have no idea that this was going to be an international press common ... of oh my God they killed this this uh this Saudi national\nOr who has a permanent us resident status his kids are us citizens\nAnd he was just\nPopping into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to get papers for a marriage license to marry his fiance who is waiting outside\nSo here's the story according to what CNN is going to report the death was the result of an interrogation gone bad so they were planning on interrogating him and something happened now when they go\nA couple of other stories and sources that are popping up here\nAnd if you click on\nIf you go to the drudge link that takes you to Jake Tapper as\nA Twitter feed so top a drudge right now in red and fun to report Saudi to admit killing journalist during interrogation so again with the Saudis things have gotten so out of hand they had no idea of this thing was going to be this humongous of a story on the world stage\nAnd listen any journalistic organization world why they're not going to stand for this and they're going to make a big deal if one of their own\nWas taken out by a ... a government by a governmental entity so that's going to be the\nClaim and I'm sure they're gonna try to paint it on one of the interrogation team members that it went too far it got out of hand and this wasn't our intent\nBut\nThey realize that they were backed into a corner that they couldn't deny this 'cause initially was denied that I Know I we did nothing I he we didn't kill him he didn't they ... this is there's no way of the Saudi king tells us to President Trump in a phone call my pump pale on the way to Saudi Arabia arm secretary of state\nSo the Saudis realize oh my God what the hell have we gotten ourselves into\nOh hang on a sec all my Allah or what the hell we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly\nHad to come clean and now if they're going to do is they get up they're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably going to pin it on ah some of the interrogation team members and then they'll probably make that individual individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished they'll probably be executed\nWhen in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do\nMake him disappear like a Roach Motel\nTo show each activity doesn't

secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in Saudi Arabia talking with leaders there and NBC correspondent bill Neely says\nDon't know\nI mean [noise] I mean this is going to be in a number\nAnd if you're on the hour we're going to\nUh [noise]\nThis is Glen Winfrey another McCaskill campaign staffer the way he details a plan for impeachment of President Trump is revealing so here's the real question\n\nThe whole region and get the moderate [noise]\nWhat are we talking a modern day after we drop named Richman amaranth and\n\n\n\n\n[noise] and also you know\nThat President\nObama we discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic us\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nLet me get money from Russia to our ... [laughter] oh okay yeah another one of those things where we can get some money and mine you know even on the deal yeah I was in a lifetime where crime\n[laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is if they asked to unless they specifically ask is voting for the wall we should let them go they need to think so I think she's saying she's on the wall and they don't ask then let them think that\nIf they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she was being told don't talk about impeachment gesture shop about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth before an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course she would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group\nYou know what our staff as saying well wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now with you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera ... Scott this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us he's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job yeah\nSean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by fondling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of the most powerful pieces was when the sky Glenn Winfrey one of McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates ... after we did the impeachment because we are going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted neck on the street yesterday with the microphone to Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota\nOh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposing\nYou don't want you know what I'm saying I'll say agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win\nAnd ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think the everybody on this showing on TV if you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a vote for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they are going along with it but they're just telling the truth so it's very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week\nBritish and talk to local media this is the kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well al these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffer said well they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't actually worked for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the ... campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologize\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program and a lot of this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know the one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun then we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he had semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed well\nAgain I think that you're rocking the world of big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying and explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations the although they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people already\nWe've got we've gotten request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have got more nations if ice but there's you know it's people are already early voting and some of the states and that is that the the bigger issue is like I said he last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next to roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie why why is our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest because voters aren't going to end in Tennessee this guy just lost\nThere's a new poll out New York times poll and he's down fourteen points after video it doesn't help you when\nPeople find that stuff out but some of these senators Sean only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\nHis name was

is imploding out in Arizona\nProject Vera toss with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened a governor governor reticent and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nAre we now see Heller was very important seat of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll only stayed I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response and that's to hurricanes and I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember showing the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey that's for Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going\nTo the devastation while Mitt Romney of basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama because member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday is why did Senator Warren have to do\nHer announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think there's a list but Warren\nRevelation or lack thereof will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive\nRight I'll give you literally the the headlines\nAround her and she's Ninety six percent European I mean at at that one one thousand twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is it but her she literally personally changed herself to minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nRight and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then we're going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof this so backfired on her ... particularly when ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that\nThat ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner but the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are ready at Trump rallies and twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah ... gets hurt him to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a girl born by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very\nRevealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it and Democrats in strategist they're prepared the memos said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their ... to ... Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps the\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer loving missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now he won with capital as well even that CNN did a\nA segment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member\nOf al ... who was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point they have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think back I Can't remember what his platform\nWas but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive hey that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or keep\nAmerica great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump's in trouble like it did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate that can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nNot sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nI always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but you know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona\nI see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this is widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe\nMansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow path if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state taxes red state Tennessee read stand\nBy the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with them this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember ... better or got more money than any cat on my God they're eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would've been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty mid terms I have got against the party in power by an average that something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know what I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up at fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump is receive the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact that you you hit two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality and we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores in gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say in it for\nA media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nI'm not allowed to say the word mob parts they will continue Joe ... he is the media reporter on the hill or will come back we're also the stormy stormy networks are a little bit quiet except for the president's tweet we'll get into that one\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue in Kenya to open ...

[noise]\nPretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand since the day Donald Trump won the left in this country doesn't quote resistance in this country now that now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and couldn't\nFrightening you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this remember Maxine Waters set it if you see them\nGet a crowd get a crowd and you confront them\nAnd you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you tell them\nYou know wanted anywhere anymore\nOkay well that
