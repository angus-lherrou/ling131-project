E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise] alright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nAnd then how are you okay thank you um upgrade a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria ban and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd do we have the needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the EU which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nMhm and I find very interesting a fight and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course Irish style and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity and units\nFor me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual that is possible in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is eight and a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and a will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration but\nYou have a political party and leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and\nPeople don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are progeny use of a of haggling marks and angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the enlightenment\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for

Y. T. at PET bomb disposal truck when they were leaving I order when they were bringing the bomb out the the pipe bomb or the suspicious package I was listening to the level of city block I mean it would probably blow somebody's face off\nA and and their fingers in hands off but if if it were if if the viable bomb and and authorities have said at least the George Soros bomb was viable but now this was in the street and I didn't rip it down but not this is real this is official\nOr police or NYPD caution tape from the incident which I collected just a little while ago\nSo now I did say a couple of pictures those around my Twitter feed again you ought to follow me on Twitter folks at Todd Smith\nMy Twitter is AT T O D the S. C. H. N. I. T. T. N. as in November Todd Schmidt at Todd Smith because I took several pictures of the media throngs and actually if you were watching cable news earlier\nThere was a bomb disposal truck that was parked into a doorway into a an inference garage or that goes into the underground parking area in the service area of the time Warner center and I walked by that every day\nAnd that's where the bomb disposal truck was that side of the street is still blocked off but I was able to walk on the south side on fifty a street or on the ah the south side of the time Warner center and I took some pictures again I tweet it all these out and they're on my Twitter feed at\nTodd snapped AT T O D day at the age and I teach the now I say phones already loaded we're gonna phones here in just a bit I Want to go over the facts as we know them I'm looking at\nThe the current rundown of who got suspicious packages now this goes back to yesterday and the George Soros story and I said flat out I said loud and clear on the show that I the poor George sources politics\nThe money he spends a the ideas he tries to a push and foment\nI don't like George Soros at all I don't want any injury or ill will or her to come to George Soros I can still be vehemently opposed to his political strategies and ideas and his activism and his funding but I don't want the guy blown up by a pipe bomb nor do I want any of his staff\nAnd that's why I was very clear on yesterday's program that there is no place no room whatsoever for whoever put this in George Soros his mailbox in northern Westchester county in New York that I Hope\nThat they are apprehended and brought to justice and then of course here we are twenty four hours later and we're discussing all these other pipe bombs which authorities believe that it's all related\nNow the interesting thing on the sorrows pipe bomb\nI came to mind none of these have detonated\nAnd that's incredible and you know as far as this ought to be a treasure trove of clues I mean even if they did explode there should be a ton of clues on these on detonated bombs in packages that hopefully authorities will be able to hone in on\nWhoever did this and we'll go over those details and just a second but with the Soros package there are numerous reports that they believe that that package might have been home delivered and place that his mailbox\nSo I mean that bring somebody maybe to the scene or is it a career was the actual bomb major was it some do that was just pay to deliver a package you know who knows\nBut a hand deliver and then we have what happened\nToday so the ... a package then we have what was delivered to CNN which caused this huge evacuation of the CNN New York headquarters at Columbus Circle and a fifty eighth and fifty nights for a\n... this this ... this this building is a humongous building restaurants and shops there there's more there's a giant whole foods in the basement of the time Warner center which is a zoo I Would avoid that one at all costs by the way\nYou've got CNN with their studios it's just a a lot of activity you've got residential and the time Warner center so you've got a hotel vi is it the Mandarin is is on the the north side of the places a gigantic complex they used to be the old New York coliseum\nWhich was abandoned in shuttered for years I used to walk by that\nWhen I used to work at W. P. O. J. radio back in Nineteen Ninety One and Nineteen Ninety two I used to live right down the street\nSo it's a beautiful complex so CNN or they get this package but the curious thing on the CNN package it was addressed to John Brennan\nFormer CIA director John Brennan very outspoken very critical of President Trump but the issue is here John Brennan does not work for CNN\nJohn Brennan is contracted to MSNBC and remember when he had a security clearance strip by President Obama by a by President Trump brother he had his security clearance I was a big story so was this intentional or when was this just a goof up\nSo to to send the pipe bomb to John Brennan terror of CNN at ten Columbus Circle of New York New York one double o two three whenever there's a ... over there I you know that that was was it a goof\nThat was that a mistake because if they were trying to set the John Brennan to chip in care of M. S. N. B. C. and not CNN\nAlso in the pack and sent to CNN and John Brennan is also some kind of a white powder in an envelope so not only the explosive device but also some type of\nWhite powder that another package was sent to Hillary Clinton an explosive device was sent to the Clinton residents in ... also west Chester county not far from Soros\nAnd that was in throughout a intercepted by the secret service member rock Obama\nA was sent to his Washington DC residents upper rock Obama was also the recipient\nOf one of these explosive devices as well on the latest now is Maxine Waters aid package was intercepted at the congressional mail facility and that was apparently address the Maxine Waters are very outspoken we you know we don't need to go over a you know her issues and problems\nUh Eric Holder and this is where things get even more interesting\nThere was a report that Eric Holder and got a suspicious package and Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a suspicious package here's the deal\nYeah the package was addressed ... Eric Holder\nBut the package was attempted to be delivered to Eric Holder the address was not a good address and it was return to the sender\nAnd whoever this little joker is that's doing these pipe bombs in packages they put Debbie Wasserman Schultz is sunrise Florida congressional office as the return address that to suggest that Debbie Wasserman Schultz set the packaged Eric Holder but no that wasn't the case\nSo the package goes back was that little added little joke kind of like the blues brothers and ah they gave the address of of ah Wrigley Field now you know at ... at ten sixty west Alice in whatever it was that the whole deal here with the the Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nReturn address so that gets return because it was on deliverable to the Eric Holder address\nAnd then it goes back to Wasserman Schultz then there was a report that Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York on a package that is not the case apparently was just some a ... a media package with a thumb drive so that\nWe were able to start in clinical trial that's led by Emily Green garden\n... the hope is that these types of therapies are going to be more effective um and a lot that are tolerate a lot more safe enemies and\nPeople ask me how I ... and it's easy when you have so many people\nTake care of you and support\nThe heart of the year ... cancer dot org a public\nService message from children's cancer research fund thirty two year old Oscar my\nVenus was taken into custody just after one o'clock this afternoon El Paso police swat and other officers with the department's crisis management team responded to the Kenyan square village apartment complex on north loop must be nist had barricaded himself inside an apartment again eventually surrender\nThis has been your ... news update 'em Robert ...

Ninety nine I Want to go to phones here and grab our our first calls a day momentarily couple of other things that I I Want to go over briefly I Want to remind you that\nIf I'm not mistaken the entire Trump family\nHave received threats not just verbally\nOr because I Know that there have been threats on Twitter against a Donald Trump junior and his kids in the family but\nAll of the Trump family members of I'm not mistaken ever seen threatening male including a white powder to emulate anthrax and to scare the Trump family I remember\nEarlier this year there was a Massachusetts man he was charged with sending an honorable which was sent to Donald Trump junior\nAnd ah that's one that his wife and opened up\nAnd I I Believe there was a maybe some ... white powder and that but there was no and if I'm On a stake in that said ah you're getting what you deserve something to that effect but they all received threats and and white powder Eric Trump has Donald Trump junior\nAll kinds of threats against the president obviously so you know this this goes both ways I listen to the attention to a whole new level if somebody is mailing\nExplosive devices and according to the authorities or at least with the the Soros device we heard yesterday and and this morning that the device sent to George Soros\nTowels or was potentially a viable explosive device but what's interesting here is that\nNone of these devices have detonated is that intentional or is that due to a clumsy they're selling the bomb maker not knowing what they're doing where these meant to demonstrate that they could have detonated but\nThey decided to not let the packages detonate upon the opening of the packages\nWas all this is yet to be determined if you're on hold hang on going to grab your calls you and just a second this is going to be a pretty damn heavy topic as you know the series of rolling in and everyone's pointing fingers all the Democrats did this it's a false flag they're trying to make it look like it's a\n... a loony tunes Trump supporter or uh it's you know a Trump supporter going after the Democrat who could be somebody that has no care whatsoever that just a sick individual trying to

these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense and this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very

go out and get a real this is\nThat's the point the reason you can do this yourself from the reason you can't do the others just wires stop and think about it\nYou have a house where let's say you're going to have thirty different sensors throughout that was I'm just picking a number of every one of those things are gonna have to have a wire run\nDo what you want to do that you're not going to do that you're going to hire some team to come out and run a site survey and then they're going to run the wires and you're not going to want the wire scene so they're going to have to be behind the wall or taped up the base boards or whatever that means miniature construction you're not going to do any of that [noise]\nAnd then when something goes wrong with wind up those wires that might trip the whole system or at least provide a fall somewhere you've got attracted to [noise]\nYou don't need any this anymore now the sensors that you get from simply say for justice ... may be better and effective as anything else you'd get communicate to the central base station in your house over why why\nSo there aren't any wires and this is why it's do it yourself and it's fun at the same time and not just the doors and windows sensors you've got glass breaks sensors you've got age the cameras motion\nDetectors they all connect me a white fight that base station\nEmits a loud siren if there is

uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling packaging\nWhatever the case may be a and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president's I just think it's bizarre ethic is way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left in they'd send cameras following you for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that ran it was going to speak about the specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could\nTalk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what an office enough already ... listen this is a time you

back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they are fake

seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good both with the right thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nOr joining us now is the attorney general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling\nDo we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working um the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources that we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work but it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton\nUm you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally so go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a rage to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's why the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should

show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you a good good I at first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and um uh the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace Obamacare\nOh I Know other stories or you know kind of take the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore\nIt was just wondering if you could give us an update about what Republicans are doing\nIf we in two weeks we have a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and\nWest Virginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races then the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're gonna have by the way preexisting conditions of big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions\nNobody is going to be denied coverage because they have a pre existing condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about I've been able to get Dr Josh amber atlas MD in front of a lot of politicians that all love the paradigm he's created in Wichita\nHe's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month the unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting first six bucks or treatment for people\nAnd you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals\nAnd if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario and it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a ...\nLet me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient\nSo there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute but does the president's not done the individual\nThe date is done thankfully thanks to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like we need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website ... dot com\nAnd the top races that I got a tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every it we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take do leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida we're a little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the sand just for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley a Dean Heller need that hang on in about\nA we definitely need Martha ... Sally war hero against this radical Christian seminars now no problems with Americans joining\nJean ... and and joining the Taliban then of course we've got Montana tester has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and in ... case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up three Bob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night\nSecond big surprise of the night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know this state uh most worried about to be very honest to Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state\nAnd you want to see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're going to

secure\nPfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate they lied and committed a fraud before the court and then they used it to set up a special counsel by leaking that information they leak

they care about Hillary's Russian allies why do they not care about Keith Ellison says\nYou know charges against him nobody is asking for FBI investigation into him and in that case we have tape

about the ...\nPresident Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right but they always go at things which is a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something legislative leads that we're working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look our\nOur outcome our ends justifies the means that

embarrassed whether or not but of course you know didn't they start saying\nWell if it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project their a toss project they started saying well all these other excuses but the point as they got caught they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go to people about where he is don't worry he
