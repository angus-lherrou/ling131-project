I Can't take the guy seriously being the flat out blatantly lied for years about his Vietnam service\nAnd the fact is that he talked about his time in Vietnam in combat and he was he was not in Vietnam in combat so this guy the people of Connecticut put a lawyer\nOn the stolen valor a story essentially put this guy in the U.S Senate or the ... from Connecticut I mean it's just it's unfathomable to me\nAnd then again I I brought Blumenthal backup\nOr last week on Thursday when we had this uh this new round of a you know special questioning with a Ford and Ann Cavanaugh and again Richard Blumenthal in his his high and mighty ah Mr pious [laughter]\nAnd I I Can't take seriously I mean the people of Connecticut how the hell can you take Blumenthal serious one and then Trump tweeted about this over the weekend\nI think it was yesterday I think it was on was Saturday Night or Sunday Morning I saw a tweet from President Trump when he calls that a Blumenthal I saw ... we're still trying to figure out who is the booze or Trump suggesting that there are some of those pretty bad shape\nA Democrat on the other side was referring to the Senate Judiciary committee or or is it just a general democratic senator or outside of the committee so we have Mazie Hirono from Hawaii Cory Booker\nFrom New Jersey and a camera law Harris from California and so those are the current

ask for just one week investigators while you got a week here\nA week and the FBI is capable of a talking to a lot of folks and the president even says that the FBI or should interview whoever they want to you know within I think he said within reason\nIs is what the president said let's dig a little deeper into this bring up to speed on the FBI questioning who's been question who is not been questions and then of course the Democrats are rolling out a list of of two dozen\nAnd whether the FBI gets to all those who knows but of course and the Democrats will belly ache oh but they didn't

Pentagon grounds I never made it into the Pentagon NBC Pentagon correspondent Courtney Cooper says there are still a few unanswered questions like\nThank you Sean Hey Greg good to be here congratulations David on your wonderful new book David is truly one of the best authors I've ever read\nIs one of the best authors and writers and columnist but it's it's also moved me as I have read these books and to realize I Need to be a better person that that is what I read the um like All right I'm a piece of crap and I'm One of the Christians that needs to saving part for sure [laughter]\nSolely on Greg congratulations on your unbelievable success with your book really thank outstanding you\nAll right let me such get into this issue now I asked Lindsey Graham last night and I'll start with you David I said well what if you fall one vote short\nBecause now the the Democrats and the senator from Hawaii that once meant to shut up is now asking that they investigated nice throwing incident from Nineteen eighty four and I'm thinking if this is what it now has come down to because the three big cases they want investigated\nIn every case there's no ... operation at all\nNone and and multiple changes in stories at least two of the three cases and yet this this goes on and the lander and the I mean I just described a story about what Julie sweating it was\nClaiming and now she has backtracked I don't even know why NBC whatever run an interview like this but they did run it even saying that well she gave U.S foreign names to investigate one's dead and the other one has no idea who she is\nAnd the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she backtrack center story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously rate Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump per se and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges in slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand up and defend himself and that his dealings with passion indicate\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair is righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable than necessary in fact to\nPreserve his position right to they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would hate to have that kind of\nInstrument tire how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete an aunt\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nA when you're greed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what he has a centrally doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals' or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused and to condemn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you got a ... and contrast that with his response on the mark on the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified and he totally indicated itself it was a massive overhaul because I think it was thought that it\n... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is\nUnfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned his family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying\nIn fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the interview which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple multiple I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer nobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said just as I Do uh the the sweat Nick\n... while the other sweating the allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true that in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term here the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing either way\nAnd the people know that what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious\nAnd I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss in them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for\nIt's fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses in the Senate on

on over five on radio stations around the world to know Sean in that statement\nSweat and they said she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge to spike punch at parties in our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically say she thought either man's spike it and the Brett\nKavanaugh you know fighting a punch putting Brian Hi and I I saw him given rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch containers [laughter]\nI don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who are a number of these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that part and we have we haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I had I had a party so yeah there are people that know about that part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweat Nick another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nTwenty five now so the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute ... how does this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago\nYou would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a ... it's just that Mick\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged with quite you lose and and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up\nOutside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago\nAnd nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does that how do you where we're at the news he entered in any ...\nCity here to put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about this is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the gold posed we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote\nNow you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nByron hey Sean listen on this on his NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nA one on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nAh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a a due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least where you can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nAre ... there was nothing to this story\nUm and when you offered a written a says you could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nAnother was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nUm was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker all the New York times couldn't print the

GSM am El Paso [noise]\nNBC News radio until I'm Robert\nThe New York times says President Trump earned a fortune by helping his family dodged taxes the paper acquaintance Trump or in the equivalent of more than four hundred million dollars by setting up a sham corporation that tailpipe gets from his parents\nA senator good to talk to you thank you for joining us there's a lot going on Mitch McConnell just earlier said that the FBI report will be finished and we will have a vote on Capitol and uh I assume what's gonna happen at some point this week we have any any timetable idea\n... I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here was the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware L like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris ... she is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredible eat any credible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who once meant by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was a pretty outrageous\nIt meant but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throwing ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're great and then I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\n... pose to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election\nAnd take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on hand so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats would know no matter who Donald\nTrump S. right they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well I'm a smart question Martha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race\nAnd do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its plans are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they warning the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party\nThat we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond doubt\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe stays couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election use in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me\nIf we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge\nDeserves a damn ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but\nShe identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut ... is that this was the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist the point I'm massaging the homophobic Xena phobic Lama fold you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's got to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff [laughter] it is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis land there has been taken to a whole new level you and you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nDown to you or you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue and candy to open ...
