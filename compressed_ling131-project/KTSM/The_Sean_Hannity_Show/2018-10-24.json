package at a congressional male sorting facility and Marilyn WGLA reports the package found at the facility in Capitol heights Maryland\nWe know today suspicious packages pipe bombs that had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program it was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and I listen what am I say about George Soros yesterday\nLike they have it on tape let me see what I said yesterday when it broke when the storm story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times report it\nIn a billionaire left this global list George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that will love the show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we\nHave an election and Thirteen Days and on almost I you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed\nI was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings hey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of the senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse you got to clear the halls you can't let these activists\nKnow getting in the faces bidding it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when you can't let this continue because it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this is a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children\nWere run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting and eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she asked to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out and write and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets it with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their leftist activist they loved the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out\nLindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news\nThere is some truth to fake news and they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should've seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global Islam I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he is or racist ... you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies of the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they wouldn't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies a bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt\nI don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in a caravan hurt\nYou know it ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious\nPackages sent to the Clintons home and ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters ... and apparently the one yesterday George tourists his home in Westchester New York suspicious packages center Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we pick up\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnd watching it happened to all these Republicans as any of this you know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are\nYou know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like my thoughts and prayers go out to anybody\nThat has to deal with this today I've had similar incidences of security in my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl that worked for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you\nKnow remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation\nBecause we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life uh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nWas it was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's on Wall to wall with reports suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray our CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only three weeks ago that that it happened here\nAnd then of course we can take it back to the ... the shooting\nWhen Steve ... nearly lost his life and to this day he struggles and has had so many operations they barely were able to save this guy's life that day\nBut for the heroin hurt the heroism of to brave Capitol police officers that took on a guy with a rifle that well had cover and walked in the middle of a baseball field it's almost a suicide mission to defend people\nI I never saw such heroism it was amazing\nBut you think of the rhetoric that we've been hearing and the build up to all of this and everyone else has been silent this isn't about left or right when when we found out that the that's the least this shooter happened to be a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSean Hannity didn't go on the air and say say I blame Bernie I just I did the opposite I don't know I Can't hold Bernie Sanders responsible\nFor the actions of of one of his ... supporters he's not responsible for that\nBut the media today and their their reaction to this is over the top so outrageous so disgusting leap partisan it just it they're so quick to blame President Trump Fox News talk radio\nAmong over you knew that friend is

three weeks ago and\nI frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case um\nThere is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere or it could very well be in and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've been hearing Democrats say they can't be civil and kick 'em and\nWe watch mobs confronting Republicans all over the country every day and not one Democrat that I Know is

I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw she's producers\nI'm In and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real um we don't know who sent them what the purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices said and they got that without detonating that\nAh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days\nWhat makes you think that Bernie [noise] well ... when you get NATO to stuff or you know you blow to pieces gets harder to\nCollect the evidence that you could send who uh who runs ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps do writing the device little side they're going to break this stuff down\nWherever how long it took to find the Unabomber I remember that case\nYeah but you know watched on tons of different times of different technologies get sprint know mailing list of those different areas and there are so many packages loose who's a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like the Amazon gene okay it's going to Democrats and it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be right off the top of their head that first suspect would be well might be some\nRadical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's a lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one is that devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation\nIncentive vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period full stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber he was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs and\nIt'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a ... let's say ways to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this they're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this\nSo it's got to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices\nAny clues but there's a part of me that believes Sean that\nThis person or persons um wanted to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish on I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent the CNN was addressed the John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you can figure out to John Brennan and then you know it'd be the comet he's not a CNN 'cause sure this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were a enough of its Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility\nYou think you do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it um from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that's I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you add a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow\nA like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City when he got ... ridge just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks so we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days um they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here\nUm that's been captured\nWouldn't you first be looking for some radical fringe we often after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and\nI've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be in ... Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that Sean and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based I going to have an obviously have an adult size these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices as the foremost someone either\nDidn't know what they were doing in March sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God or\nThey somehow want it to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin but you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish that they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre or this whole cases very bizarre even look John even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized typing and the pictures the media is put out about these devices I mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commissioner who has some experience in the space\nBook this package is suspicious here's this big oversized hyping it there's something out about this\nWhere in orange commission and where where would you where would you start\nWell listen there's one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is uh what if it's a hoax when it's not one of these devices real what if they're not real at all in this person lunatic wherever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate\nA lot as a good possibility given uh what what Dan ... the the amateur hour a look of the packages or I Would uh you know I'd be skeptical and uh I'd wait on the uh the outcome of the forensics\nCancer cells in the body understanding has led to a revolutionary approach called immunotherapy and a new hope\nFor how we'll find cancer in the future this is Jimmy Smith and I'm here with stand up to cancer immunotherapy works by boosting our body's natural immune system empowering to identify and radicalized many\nTypes of cancers oh because he's not and visit us you to see dot org slash immunotherapy to see if this approach may be right for you or your loved ones in\nYour body might just be your greatest hope\nIt sure would not comment on the investigation with this CBS for news update I made that\nThis is a Bloomberg market minute stocks took a mid week pounding the Dow Jones industrial last six hundred eight points or two point four percent the NASDAQ closed three hundred twenty nine points or a four point four percent lower the ups and the five hundred lost eighty four points or three point one percent\nBurns McKinney valley ... global investors tells Bloomberg it is likely stocks will look better soon\nTypically five percent pull backs or even ten percent pull back that are not accompanied by recession tend to bounce back pretty quickly\nThe U.S in the five hundred fell below a level where a technical strategist a J.

the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal\nBut she's not going to tell you that until after the election anyway project very toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are you [noise]\nHey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director\nHer Washington DC campaign office uh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and McCaskill have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those uh Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying so\nIt's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states they have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play that they are progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be settled liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this is what Jesse Overton says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that our party has pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that ... that's what we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and nearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne for this is not a good choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do they have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda\nAnd so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone\nTelling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do\nIn Missouri they're east Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm
