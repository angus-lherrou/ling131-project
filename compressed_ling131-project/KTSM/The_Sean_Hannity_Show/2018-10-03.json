Ted Kennedy I don't want to be starting on this phone calls in a minute or my beef with NBC News here\nAnd again there were some\nIs climbers or there there was more to NBC's report on MSNBC this is Kate Snow ... snow national correspondent for NBC News and she anchors one of the weekend shows I think the Sunday NBC nightly news ah from New York\nAnd she had to sit down with this Julie\n... who ah apparently the FBI that could even mess with sweat and that guy yes [laughter] which some Democrats have asked that they interview her but you know we know the the FBI is interviewed for we'll get to that and just a bit here but the sweat Nick ... has massive credibility problems now\nNBC News they play in an excerpt of the interview during the NBC nightly news or a portion of one ran a longer interview on MSNBC the deal is though is that millions of more people will watch the NBC nightly news\nAh interview and that package that clip on the NBC television network them all watch on MSNBC on cable\nSo while they might have asked some questions or had some disclaimer is on MSNBC they didn't do the same with the clip the theme ran\nOn the NBC nightly news last night first of all my question for NBC News is why the hell would you give the sweat and make the time of day anyway\nYou have other mainstream outlets that I think that this woman is quarterly she has a host of legal issues\nA restraining order from an ex she's been accused of defamation I mean she's had a bunch of legal issues\nApparently and a lot of other outlets are staying away from this uh this woman uh CNN they had a ... on a\n... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made\nWhen Avon lady first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's a she's backed off of some of these claims so NBC News Kate Snow they said they couldn't be sure\nThat they reported that that this sweating it couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys who assaulted during a party and the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off [laughter]\nThat that's that's a change in the story\nSo remember this this sworn affidavit that came out last week from this this Julie sweating it\nRestaurant

Supreme\nAnd you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case\nAbout what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any allegations you know what I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence\nThat is the Democratic party today for getting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the u._s.\nSupreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country and I actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance\nThat have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done with the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate\nI Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee had found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place\nShe mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties\nBut as he said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys in these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person a backup or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody that I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nWell they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug ... girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nYou police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nFinally need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations for really are about how he behaves bringing in drug\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett cabin on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office\nIn further claimed afford never voiced any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the\nDay she said they were for people that could corroborate her story none of them can corroborate her story\nMost don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the\nAlleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to\nPresume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony you got to assume that they didn't commit perjury\nAnd commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and\nI've got to believe and assume that they're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed she just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee [noise] um you know it's\nJust [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means because what it means\nMatters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter Lindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor for it and I I think the the Republicans held the\nActually did something well\nI think they handled it with the level of seriousness a topic like this deserves\nAnd we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way a democratic protesters by the way it's taught at a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office apparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're gonna have to start kicking people out of ... of these\nSenate buildings income

you if you represent in the country Mitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and\nSo we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have Grassley saying the investigation now is almost done\nForward complaining the FBI never contacted her but they have a story

election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know if if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections were Republicans led a generic ballot just to give you some historical context but in mid September it was fifty two thirty\nEight and I know

only tell you what's going to happen\nIf in fact the Democrats win and what's gonna happen is very basic fundamental and simple\nIs they will have endless non stop investigations Kavanaugh gets

interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power a fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for having all your complicit with evil\nThat's raw power\nOr the kind of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable for this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really to the Democrats that would have considered voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is the second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency a judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal in fact\nAll those things I think I mean that the Susan Collins the world is going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for a very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote on ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that pass and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case that if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence or the night he said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back and now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nDo you want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from MS Thirteen gangs from ... from ... are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radical I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we could have as much fun on election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the seat Nevada but I think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power there\nSome course now that's probably have campaigns\nPlus we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember it and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do an interview with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you are going to lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radicalization I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare\nThey're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country and I think that we just have to go out and wager campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hardworking decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to do a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means taxpayer abortion well they're very few places in

lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job uh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe the same reason he's the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting a ... year\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence on your have incumbent democratic members of the Senate with court records well out their wealth discuss\nUh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney I didn't pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means but I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified and whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak and timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have

Kavanaugh's accuser are angering senators but White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says facts are facts Sanders called allegations against a federal judge false and baseless\nIf you're giving different recollections in different than a A R cases in scenarios that you've outlined that's a problem\nIf all of a sudden you're accusing somebody\nOf something and it gets printed by the New Yorker and the New York times of all places well they spend an entire week calling dozens of people and they learn that the accuser is calling former classmates asking them if they remembered what happen because the accuser saying to them\nWell she's not really sure what happened then you've got the whole well they were putting drugs and they were drug in girls almost on a weekend basis I went to Penn of these parties myself\nAnd and he's one of them men and boys were lined up in the halls and after these girls were drug they were gang rape train rate does they were lying in the hall and they're not balls into while I saw him near the punch bowl\nAnd and I saw him give red solo cups to people and well he wasn't standing in line but I saw him he was in a whole um that is so over the top and the fact the media would run that interview with so many inconsistencies in all cases\nNo corroboration not the case of professor board not the case of Mr Ramirez and not in the case with Julie sweat Nick no ... ... ...\nTons to go with us the gentleman Toensing\n... will be back to the program I'm Victoria will start with you get your take on all the\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses\nIt's so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story but nevertheless\nJohn Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's\nOr the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers out you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that in the case of Julie sweating neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made these statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know that is I Know that we\nHave now examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidence in high school\nWell I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs needs to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ... be investigated by a federal grand jury\nTo act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate for her story there is no substitute education permits Ramirez story and I just wanted to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied liked her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nOh I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe Senator Grassley I think the Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise I remembered Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats never catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend\nTen or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world I\nI may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are\nFor safety now why is her story not include\nHer going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about that we all know that there are real evil predators there are\nPeople that do murder and rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they afford it every ... which was the right thing to do but for the Democrats\nThey just they just now I pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably\n... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborated and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is nonexistent shot us in happen that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and picking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned that music up so nobody could hear her and then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what\nYou think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming a final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you
