St Petersburg not Florida [laughter] not not putting our county a bunch of St Petersburg Russia\nAnd she's been charged with using social media platforms to create listening this thousands of social media accounts also creating email accounts\nThat all were designed to make it look like it was coming from a United States citizen was coming from somebody here in the U.S to according to\nThe charging documents to create an amplify divisive social media and political content\nAmong the ... are among the\nTopics here according to the wire reports and this is a combination I think this is Associated Press and NBC News or the topics that were uh were broached here\nGun control of the women's march the NFL anthem situation gun control and I say gun control gay rights\nAre also picking up on specific events also ah fomenting a discourse on the horrific Las Vegas shooting a little over a year ago on the strip of the country concert also oh\nAnd to stir things up with that that Charlottesville debacle that unite the Right rally uh there were numerous a political positions that were taken it wasn't just one it was just trying to sway opinion\nYou also had American politicians that were attacked Paul Ryan John McCain Mitch McConnell a former president Brock Obama or\nJohn McCain did I say McCain Marco Rubio or on the list here or the federal prosecutors in the court charging documents\nAre they included a display of these are fake Internet uh graphics these these Internet means if you will\nThat were posted and then try to circulate via all these bogus social media accounts are pretending to be\nAmerican people trying to push this narrative out when in fact you have a a woman heading this thing up in St Petersburg Russia ah\n[noise]\nI've got some examples of the means you don't get to that in a second again this is just breaking up kind of a rolling through this a live having a chance to look through all the charging documents here uh the federal prosecutors said this Russian woman Kush nova\nIs a chief accountant for a Russian organization called the project locked tough\nWhich they get their money from a a rich Russian dude otherwise known as an oligarchy\nOr his connected the Concorde companies and they were also involved in a separate indictment that was brought back in July by Robert Mueller's team\nAnd they were accused of meddling or attempted meddling back in the twenties sixteen election so here we are new rushing back but you know I got to be honest here a false breaking news here on Smith I don't think I'm is worried about this Russian meddling [noise]\nAs I Am about\nThe Texas Democrats mentally ... known Russians here\nAlthough I get to that here the second one of the means quickly let me let me bring this thing up but I just I downloaded a file\nOn one of the Russian means for instance a ... to to try to sway voters or to so um anger and and discourse one of the means that there's a Russian woman [noise] uh put out\nIs a photo of a what appears to be a Mexican or Central American family\nOr a a father or mother who's pregnant clearly with a big baby bump sitting down and then a whole bunch of other kids in their laps\nAnd ... it's a photo of what they want you to think are illegal aliens are either in this country are coming to the country and you must Internet me with the photo of what's purported to be illegals\nThe caption the graphic says every the port is illegal household saved taxpayers seven hundred thousand dollars that's why it is very important to keep families together\nAs they're all being deported\nSo again you've got multiple things at play here just one of the the means but going back to I did I pick your curiosity here or that I'm not as concerned with the Russian meddling per se ...\nUnless you know again I'm being slightly facetious here yes there is no place for Russian meddling the Chinese are meddling multiple governments are those are the two biggies the Russians are the Chinese and there is zero tolerance to zero plays for this and\nIt it is in foreign countries trying to interfere with our democratic process you in the United states\nAnd I've got a zero tolerance it did happen back in twenty sixteen or it is happening now we knew it was happening we've been talking about the continuation of this for months and months and months old I said I'm I'm not trying to downplay Russian meddling is a problem\nA Trump needs to be tougher with let them your ... name has come around a little bit but not as tough as he should have been at the beginning uh and I've got zero tolerance however let me tell you what else either zero tolerance for\nHow about Texas Democrats and their\nElection meddling yeah talking about interference I got your interference
