attorney Scott Brady\nYou know wealth gun issues I listen to me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches in this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in the history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military on the perimeter in the property on every in every\nHall of every school and that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured so it's a\nThought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely and even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they do nothing about\nYou know they don't take the time the either bother to watch or listen to this program if you've been listening to the program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting bidding at senators not letting them closed doors there\nWe've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality is cotton we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders and her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have been his his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's gotta stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric what are we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks going to happen when the crowd is warm and you follow them into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted\nAny anywhere anymore ... how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's the guy's name from Connecticut again ... looming fall when I was coming out there who was in the middle of the Capitol hearing you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces is Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there\nThat we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nThere's no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that want me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life and even if it's being spent is islands me you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know\nThreatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at a time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box\nBut you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch\nThe Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre on President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country\nYou can chronicle it\nYou can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape manner ... calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney Bowers by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for\nJewish people and then the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know bad word of a quote ... infestation but despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what is he talking about Paul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically\nKrugman pleading all linked to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism as anything to do a Trump oh no\nIt's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful\nColumn in the Daily Caller today and he's been a a passionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz and he went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hid the picture for eight years\nShame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with Farah ... Khan one of the greatest purveyor of anti some medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nYou know there's there's rarely bashing Trump painter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh we're hearing renewed calls to have a national conversation\nWell as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect you know if you look at some of the the the history now with the Democratic party that don't seem to be the supporters of Israel they once were and it's not limited just the Farrakhan you know yeah Palestinian activists window source or well known that\nYou know she\nWas up a lead organizer of the anti Trump women's march where Madonna's said she dreamed of an awful lot about blowing up the White House was not so well known as the association the many prominent elected Democrats have what's our store\nYou know

candidates increasingly you know they're they're being team was the most radical types with if it was if it was Trump I can assure you there'd be a lot of people speaking out\nOr we have a lot more to talk about we'll talk about how you know Fox is under fire I'm under fire house never Trump or is it just so bitter and angry that they can't stand how wrong they were they they want to do everything

that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you had a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving

people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen that we're a nation of laws to turn around that to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep\nComing although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend in a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having been a pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question on the Mark I'm in the actually that's a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's elected who basically tried to a ... or the constitution and make themselves or presidents for life fearing that with the Venezuelan\nAnd leave out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our will and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and that is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment or bad and our allies look that\nWell I may look America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border\nWall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with us ... seem to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come when according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get it just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and if people rush across our border being at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to\nBe given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here are coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent we don't want to vote for and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to I'm again I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built\nUm I I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty I saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding what looked like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or you know million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there as things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nIt without question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the border\nThat we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about if you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion\nAnd we obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of you know\nAll right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight hundred nine for one Sean is our number you want to be a part of the program we got to take a break right so the biggest part of off year elections mid term elections or turn out that means you showing up\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in decades why because your savings your tax savings that's on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's comeback is on the ballot your jobs are on the ballot your kids' future is on the ballot your wages your four O. one K. is that is also on the ballot\nAnd if you're a small business owner your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who is in charge of America's future politicians bureaucrats the socialist in DC or you you want to preserve the victories of the past two years\nOld get involved this election this November and go to big choice election dot com big choice election dot com\nThey're going to make it simple for you to do your part now you can mail make calls and emails tax knock on doors help neighbors get to the polls go to a big choice election dot com because the only way we lose this year is if you don't show up if you don't turn out go to big choice election dot com do your part\nAnd let's not get out worked in November big choice election dot com will come back for your phone call straight ahead eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number\nOh yeah right here and get out of a media man room\nDoing [noise] Shaun\nHannity show sing formed\nOn the child's cancer trying just asked researcher Brandon Moriarty about his latest breakthrough or a genetic biomarker ...\nJordan's cancer research fund is read organization they provide funding to really dig deep into the research and make more\nWe were able to start a clinical trial that's led by Emily Green guard\nThe whole says that he's had to therapy and aren't going to be more effective um and a lot that are tolerate a lot more safe\nAnd people ask me how I my mom I have it easy\nWhen you have so many people\nTake care of you for\nA part of the cure cancer doubt or a public service message from children's cancer research\nPeople numbers but don't you Anna counties also seeing a surge in early voting more than twenty thousand votes having cats so far that includes more than sixteen thousand people at the polls and more than four thousand absentee ballots early voting for John ... county started on October ninth everything you're CBS for and he got the analysts and he's near\nMisses a Bloomberg market minute trade worries hit Wall Street hard hunting wild swings the Dow made a journey of nine hundred points for more than three hundred point tier to dropping about five hundred before finally finishing lower by two hundred forty five\nThe NASDAQ dropped one hundred Seventeen the S. and P.

seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words there are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians send them out can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the latest polls beyond any imagination I have\nA poll has a dead heat exactly even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRhonda Santas was coming back interesting John James Michigan is cut his the leaders stabbing now in half and it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was one twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest\nAll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing is very weak and could be the big surprise of the night\nBoth West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top thirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of\nCommissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district to fill Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say that Sean first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say that people buy matured but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing in the case of Tennessee got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day that Democrats think everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media had two scenarios out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast that to two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change give the crumbs back increase to regulate\nIts watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent goes and talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "29"}
