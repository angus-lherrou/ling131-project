War I'm\nLike but there are certain aspects of our chilly relationship these days with the Russians which are a little cold warrior ...\nBut you know it's not a second Cold War just yet but we'll vis a vis new move by the White House will this potentially prompt a a a greater freeze a with our relationships with the the Russians so we'll find out\nObviously as time goes on here I got the President

these countries that are not able to stop their migrants these\nUh these these caravan ers from trying to come to the United states so the president talks about cutting off or reducing aid to Honduras Guatemala El Salvador uh this is a response to those governments doing jak squat and try to prevent\nThese citizens of theirs from trying to come to the United states\nTo our southern border we had a number of tweets from the president this morning and and the escalation of the rhetoric is obvious and I guess what I Want a tough president\nI Want trust a Trump to be a tough here\nA that stuff has

in Fifteen days and it's a question a lot of people who are in the world would vote for Democrats why would you vote for anybody\nThat is promising to wipe out all the progress why would you vote for any party that wants to literally shut down the progress and here's what the more ... had to say\nIt's because of the media probably shot I mean I think that could be one of the main reasons most people predicted that the house and so forth goes to the other side but the president is demonstrating that he can get the voter turnout\nEven in a midterm election and so I think it can be very close I mean you're not going to be surprised to our friends are not going to be surprised Rush Limbaugh is not going to be surprised if the Democrats um don't win or don't ...\nYeah it it you know again conflicting news if you missed the beginning of the program there there's I'm Charlie Cook who is the inside the beltway go through and analyze in predicting the outcome of the off year election in

just make stuff up [noise] oh that's one thing you learn as prevalent as it gets cold in Ocala\nYeah called the no account well we know is record eight years Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty lowest labor participation rates in the seventies worst recovery since the forties\nLowest homeownership rate in fifty one years the only president in American history never to reach three percent GDP Growth than a year\nThe only one any accumulated more debt than all forty three presidents before him come by\nA facts are very stubborn things Mr President

unemployment\nFor African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets and youth unemployment all setting record low numbers that's great for the American people we have better trade\nDeals than we've ever had were paying less abroad than we've paid before because the president's the go shaded even with NATO even with Western European countries we have a much better deal the benefits are farmers for one or dairy guys for too\nIn Wisconsin\nAnd Michigan and elsewhere the the manufacturing jobs that Obama said would never coming back now starting to come back four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs the largest number in Thirty years just under President Trump not under Obama\nA better trade deals with Canada with Mexico abroad Israel now we've

mullahs that hate us and little rocket man\nYou know fire and fury and my button is bigger than yours is not firing rockets over Japan every other day and the president didn't pay a penny to get back our hostage is number one didn't pay a penny to get back the remains of Americans that have been there since Nineteen fifty three or four or whatever it is\nAnd still gets criticized and all of this

offering\nWhereas there call because I can play the Democrats and I'll do it later in the program I can play them off sounding like Donald Trump during the Obama years only now they won't open borders because they think it benefits them politically although that's now backfired to the point where John Podesta sending out memos\nWith the center for American Progress they don't\nTalk about that don't talk about immigration Maxine stopped talking about impeaching forty five\nI Would say if I had to guess my best after all this study and that I Do every single day and all the polls I look at every

United states and the council\nStay informed with news radio six Ninety Kate DSM am El Paso\nHad received news radio I'm John Jeffries national security adviser John Bolton says President Trump could have another face to face meeting with Russian President Vladimir ... next month\nWe've got to do several things than I Am so adamantly against illegal immigrant people have to stop employing illegal immigrant\nTo west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street foreigners in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to see people waiting to get picked up to go do yard work and construction work and domestic work you know this is not a problem that the people who are coming\nInto the country are solely responsible for counting if we put them to work\nKeep families together\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship number of immigrants added to labor force every year as of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly low skilled workers provide some benefits through the economy as a whole it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community who have argued passionately\nThat we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put them in the deportation until we have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was just 'cause I was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration quite amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and uh I'm In Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints\nIs a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been of the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on it alone that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that's personal but you know the fact is the never Trump\nOr his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what\nThree weeks three and a half weeks but one thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we then have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I don't ... and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose\nI said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great test that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talked about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices\nThey can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them and northern Mexico only if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision to say I deemed to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that blocked\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for that if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nBut remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best for planned for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons for doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nBut they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator and effective human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and I'm actually going to have what what could be but then as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point\nWe we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln is saying over and over again yeah uh you know\nIf you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union he didn't say it happily he didn't say that excited we met many of his key early speeches this nostalgic sadness to the\nUh the we're bound together by the common core of mystique memory now we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end\nAnd people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like

to Kevin McCarthy is house it through a Boulder through the window I'm at so they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like\nWhat has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing leak claiming credit for it yesterday if they want the successor to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] well I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left that you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to a total of cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said there will be forced to a former attorney general saying when Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying it's OK to harass people uh and drive them out of public life or you know and remember that Maxine Waters is not a trivial person she would share\nFor their banking and financial services committee if they get control the house\nSo she never again people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of the illegitimacy of of the modern American government which the left passionately believes a I think that\nYou're right that that's a factor the reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment\nIs these are historical events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics\nWas historic we're we're going to get\nA solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be smeared and parents were assassinated and lied and manipulated and browbeat and in fact I doubt now that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect clinics forty or fifty years\nA

even said to me he prayed for me and I I I Am I'm very touch when people say that to me and I know you mean you're a good guy\nAnd and David has written these books she started with persecution his first book on faith and religion and um I think now the best book yet it's called Jesus has risen poll in the early church\nAnd David is that a pretty profound impact on me making me realize I'm not that religious and then I I Believe everything um I I Would be one of those people that sort of shows up at Christmas and Easter at your church\nOr and I don't go to church that much but uh but I Believe all of us and uh and both of you have encouraged me to to want to be better does that make sense\nIt makes a lot of sense or you know are often times is contagious and faith one can rub off

with him we got him myself that one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had always

come out\nAnd then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets does exactly well\nMaybe but you know I listen I trained five days a week an hour and a

age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did well\nI look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that there's a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated you know some people are going to vote the party regarded as but others say listen I'm tired of this\nBecause all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign\nBut you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American\nConservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million Moran poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up\nAnd you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating at twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just recording tell him as a message to let them is in the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular thought he's going to get on the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... the word or\nEducation from the Latin is in today to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political corps him and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nIdentity politics and changing the rules and this

be made in terms of who's going to control the house look I think we're going to do well in the Senate but you know off year elections are historically what they are and they're tough\nBut I Do think that you have a great chance of holding on to the seat because you've served the people in North Carolina oh\nSo this is a blue moon election for us here in North Carolina there is no governor no us centered on the ticket I'm at the top of the tickets so you know well that makes mom really proud of the same time uh it's I'm at the top of the ticket and so we've got to make sure that people come out at the for us uh Shaun this was a turnout turnout turnout election people just\nHave to get out and go vote a we've got all the way through November third and then back again on November six has plenty of early voting um you know we've got a lot of good things on the ballot in North Carolina this year\nI'm I'm very excited I think we're going to win this but we've just got to do the work\nWe've got to have people turn out like the president knows how important this as he's been into the district um he's coming back again to the state here friday night as a sport my hope to be colleague mark hairs on your Charlotte but ah yeah we've got a lot of tough races this year there's been a lot of articles written about North Carolina Thirteen but\nYou know like you said I'm a is a clear contrast race I'm a conservative member of the Freedom Caucus I'm In a tough district I'm a small business center my opponent\nShe's one of the largest Nancy Pelosi donors ah she's against the tax cuts and JOBS Act she's getting a lot of outside money from pillows he's packed Tom ... the peach Trump guy a from a bomb a superPAC and it's come all that money is flooding and right here to the middle of North Carolina so it's a tough fight one that we can win but it's definitely a clear contrast you know\nBoth the cook Political Report in odds maker Nate Silver and tightened their assessment of this race\nOr and the cook report actually listed this is North Carolina what you can explain the exact areas are that are going to be impacted by by this um this district anyway is among the five congressional districts across the country\nThat it said had shifted more towards democratic candidates and yours is gonna be a a bellwether district and you're going to come in I think your polls closed what seven thirty but I remember correctly on election night\nOr they do and so we're going to fight all the way through the end\nAh look this is a district that goes from Greensboro
