Bush or whomever so again I support the president going to Pittsburgh the president\nOn the temple\nThe synagogue\nSays he's my president he's welcomed but you contrast that with the fact that the mayor of Pittsburgh the mayor's name is bill ... do do\nYou watch the part of the Trump he says I'm not I'm not going to be with Trump I'm not going to be at the airport when he arrives which is pretty standard for mayors and and and dignitaries do appear he says no not going to be there are also the county executive his name is rich Fitzgerald he's not going to be there\nThe governor of Pennsylvania is Tom Wolfe and he will also not meet with Trump and an interestingly all of the congressional leaders also declined the ride\nTo a hand with the president and first lady so Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader Paul Ryan the outgoing speaker of the house of of course on the Republican side they said no that they did not accept the invited to go and then on the Democratic leadership side Chuck Schumer the Senate minority leader\nAnd the Nancy Pelosi or the the devil leader for the house of representatives are below sea and Schumer also declined but let me [noise] but before we move on and we're going to monitor the president when he arrives in if\nHe speaks and we'll bring you audio during the course of the show this I'm telling you right now that this is a Trump damned if you do damned if you don't situation President Trump deciding to go which again I think is the right thing to do\nOr his being met with some resistance but again you have the leader of the synagogue that was the center of the attack the target\nThe head of the synagogue is saying he's my president he's welcome you don't want that to me is what counts the most so if Trump didn't show up\nIt'd be impacted or how ... you know he's on Twitter is talking about this and he hasn't gone to Pittsburgh so I think this is a classic example of\nThe president is heading there and he's taken flack and and criticism from individuals but if he didn't go he'd be the same individuals problem would be saying the same thing about or just reverse in\nThat can't believe the president is not making a trip so again damned if you do damned if you don't eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number Iran Schmidt I did see in Pittsburgh media\nThat a Mayor Bill or William for judo the mayor of Pittsburgh he wanted President Trump to wait so hold off on his presidential visit until all the funerals had been completed of\nThe victims which again I mean could the president have done that and made a statement that he's going to wait\nI surely caught them but again I think that in a time of uh of grieving and morning that presidents do make appearances to the best of my recollection on a similar timeframe so again I I I don't fault the president and I'm guessing that if he didn't show up\nThat he'd be the the subject of criticism and and ridiculed for that I Want her to show today you know Whitey Bolger them the famous uh mobster Whitey Bolger apparently whacked in a federal\nLock up in West Virginia he said no home to the players\nAre so in West Virginia and why the ball he's been moved all over the place memory a big Boston mobster and then he was on the run for what about sixteen years and he was finally busted\nAt some you know nondescript a condo or a little apartment complex in Santa Monica you know on a couple of blocks off the pier I think about a half mile off the the Santa Monica pier so Bolger\nA reports habit for multiple sources that he was white in prison by somebody connected with the mob so ... and ... eighty nine years old\n[noise] eighty nine\nAnd you know Bolger had FBI protection for years because he was a an informant so I Wonder if that has to do with you know why he was taken out and did they know that they put them in a facility apparently was some other inmates connected to the mob\nOr ... more is going to come out but the ... those are the early rumblings so Whitey Bolger taken out which is\nIt's quite incredible what's the fiduciary responsibility of the federal prison system to protect to a guy like Whitey Bolger\nCertainly caught some folks off guard guessing the warden was going to have a a thing or two to answer might get a phone call from\nFrom somebody important to check up on this\nAh [noise] again just a lot of ground to cover there is some Bob ... breaking news this Hillary Clinton situation with this audio by this

Israel from Tel Aviv\nThe Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic cause this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... a full of Russian launch\nUsed to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get Pfizer warrants unverified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something\nLet's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them for moving the embassy to Jerusalem and the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be\nMaybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of the threat of Iranian had Gemini and the region now caused an alliance that was unthinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media\nThey don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up their rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a nationalist David Duke comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for finally admitting that your own life fashion list and then you have a we even some Republican back ventures are that\nAre are linking George Soros in these anti Semitic threats\nTo the caravan Fox

certain countries talking about gypsy ... lines up historically exactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they're hungry gypsies and Jews [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nSo we have to stop demonizing people and not even I think biggest terror threats\nIn this country is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\n[noise] there was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning host adjusting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be hearing in\nOn the two pillars of the media\nContinuing hit the trail and attacks against me and my current continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to say using some of the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of invaders and\nIn Beijing for these tragedies work at cross purposes narrative so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this you know joint less pay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy TV MSNBC\nYou've also a time has gone along with them as as cars out there who not only\nThat such a cycle I like the guy on the way it was like oh here in New York character he's not a Republican or Democrat he's just an advocate size on that [noise] and I don't mean that in an ad hominem wet [laughter]\nNah not at all let me tell you what it means they are afraid they ... look there are three scenarios as I said for election night\nWe'll be examining

never understood at\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of\nShock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white flash it'll against the country et

tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd

working on a great deal\nAbout the nature of America well to learn I think that a billionaire liberals can't buy elections or because the people in the Gulf interaction that's not true I don't believe\nWhy are you so confident in the election now I feel pretty good about the Senate\nBut you know I'm always I guess I was 'cause I'm Irish but I always uh going into elections I always tell people it's really up to them that's the case this election midterms we have a headwind against us historically speaking only three times in the last hundred years as the party in power in the White House or been able to gain seats\nLike well gained them in the Senate but then we've got you know at least thirty thirty five house races mostly Republicans on defense too close to call\nI think that's right now our reasons um you know will come from very wise there will be\nOn every everyday American rebel a starting about two thousand and with the Tea Party rebelled earlier when Ronald Reagan on them at the con critically Monica a rebellion many ways created clump then we're in for them that rebellion\nAnd the result is you now have states like North Dakota Montana I'm a jury\nOr the west Virginia where there is a huge base that we believe that they're involved in a college and that causes more than just everyday politics and I think it's it's just fascinating to watch because I think\nThe media doesn't get it show up my mind he's got a little car tomorrow basically search\nOn the planet aside because over time if you if you're talking about the ... ah the\nMitch McConnell Donald Trump team is gonna be in control center and people say well so I don't like every judge for the next few years would have been blocked by Schumer\nSick about that all of those workers when Donald she's been historic an amazing would have come to a halt\nThe minute the Democrats controlled the Senate so just in terms of judge this is a very consequential election and I looked at item after item after item on and I see\nThat we're going to be in the Senate and my guess is we're somewhere between plus three and a number I don't have the courage to say 'cause it's too high now but I can see the\nWay have you ever not had the courage to speak your mind that just is not true while you're listening but look I'm urging people to be cautious and and act like you're behind because I think we shouldn't take anything for granted\nLike I Believe that Marsha Blackburn is going to win I Believe that ... going to win and Missouri I Believe Heidi Heitkamp is done I Believe that Braun is going to win as long as people don't vote libertarian in ... Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban for Americans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and I actually look at the different levels you have met Mendez on a very long state where the Democrats should be safe but his personal\nOr gals or when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I in some very very unsavory rumors that were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll cabin to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else and help them get back into New Jersey because we're over there you can really really good candidates\nWho is a great there see I'm very pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home\nThat many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nUh how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think ... no no for the rest of us should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out one voted to end up not having to buy election they do not do anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics and they have to wonder written for the\nNumber of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did have forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning the bottom of about two oh one between policy where speaker and hiring them around to Twenty one or two thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up his speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I hadn't either when I really can't I mean and I think I Am and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nA sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nNot anyone who does not bode has effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi speaker no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house and people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services committee which was just saying the phrase\nIt tells you how crazy their party is how how could you then again she was smart lady she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services to 'em and she'd go down to less than you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all he don't like them or is it sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half a vote for Nancy closer to the next week um I think that's\nGood yeah I don't have to tell the people there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for

you both for reticent in Tennessee\nYou're you're voting for humor and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in

Pompeo were calling for a cease fire in Yemen just as the Saudi led coalition escalated attacks\nOrange County and found out that Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think California races being that important but now it's become crucial in terms of in a we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com\nUm that they're really focused in in which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this was a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can money ... ... exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced\nThe money and the negative ads\nYeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest employment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era\nToo where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS eat\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job of the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out and vote so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now\nAnd the Democrats have thirty nine and sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we've got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that\nUh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it get to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the problems that you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave the liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it I mean it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is the union's control Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of the of the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions or California Democrats than in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so uh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you it's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days\nAre All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called well New York's on the verge of re electing Cuomo and who am I wasn't going to

and here we could be literally creating wealth beyond our wildest expectations pretty sad\nVery sad you know what's going on and I\nI I'm In that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on health care as a situation because when they rolled out before to CARE Act became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and um I have extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's hes that I've had 'em\nThat are no longer covered and yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up yet again and less coverage getting dang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was was calling to talk about the health care\nWell I've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody that is now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots that gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep their plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lives that were told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in upstate New York would get the prosperity that
