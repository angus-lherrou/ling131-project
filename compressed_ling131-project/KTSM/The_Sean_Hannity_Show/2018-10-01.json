that he has not putting limits on the scope of the investigation into possible sexual assault by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this is\nOur seventh investigation\nOf the man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through at the\nInvestigate all three credible allegations\nOf sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with firsthand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself\nAnd that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... that she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said there's a credible allegation well if it was so credible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them\nLast week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the Kennedys parties herself personally that there was wrecked cabin on and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a a whole series of allegations he looked at it as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the best march meant character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nI Am Feinstein had this first six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had\nIt early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh then of course we simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that friday and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and won emails sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed ever cats need to find people who are familiar with what the blackout was an I worked as a bartender for a number of years\nI Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched it up close and personal you know everybody's got a number for some people numbers to and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous you know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all\nI learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond whatever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he was a pollster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the green a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning of one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't if this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels are going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda\nFor

would be limited in scope oh no no now they're demanding a full fledged FBI investigation into everything and they're even telling the FBI had to do their jobs and James Comey is suggesting well if you don't talk to the FBI\nIs pretty amazing to me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem with that is if you don't remember something perfectly\nWith the FBI and you're talking to them it's a chronic it's a felony and if you don't believe me asked General Flynn and if you don't believe me asked Papadopoulos who pays five years in jail\nYou know the idea that yeah the FBI back in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email investigation the deputy director said to me you know you're totally screwed right\nWell maybe you shouldn't have been writing in may before you interviewed Clinton and before he interviewed any of the other Seventeen witnesses maybe maybe shouldn't have been writing the exoneration before\nThe investigation was screwing if he did it right\nThere's there's no greater bigger case slam dunk case

but we live in a world where the president routinely attacks the FBI because he fears it's work no\nHe attacks the upper echelon of the FBI you Mr call me you personally\nAnd he fired you and you

it incorrect to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... with the other headline and then as much as I Know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever had a great deal of hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if

FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge\nBrett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last\nWeek if they don't want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we got an interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of the left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we're going to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one

watching a and you cannot cross by reminded me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there was an amazing show at a time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows them the doing of things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one first I'll work conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect that there's something wrong then he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the problem is we're going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita brought her ex FBI investigation they don't want\nAny of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest

I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master control in the FBI they're actually going to be this horrible part is an organization you know it it it it\nIs and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line [noise]\nTake your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYet it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this kind of them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench\nJudge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I but it\nUp you know the parents to do auto reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ...\n... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I said I've course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and this is just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nLie to the Senate as their ... with their ... it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI can't ...\nCan't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything to hear that there there's protection\nUnder them around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former your classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why puppet he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit attempts so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm impressed there even count as a credible allegations but you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly getting getting a whole new ones and they don't make any recommendations they're just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said
