was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things\nBut the Senate all aside for a minute if you asked the man on the street name me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be building that well and protecting our border and Republicans I understand\nWhy in some cases but\nRepublicans did not follow through for him\nThey just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you is because the Democrats stood on the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written [noise]\nWar is because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected\nI don't know anybody who votes thinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them again their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with\nThe voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our border and and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step I'm Larry O'Connor infer mark I live in hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys though I've watched I've watched the\nBorder over the years grew up in a Chandler, Arizona\nAnd you know they actually had a ... year they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and then you have people standing in line trying to do with the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know they're all it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him right\nIf oh if only that really were the case if ... what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean there have been there forever I mean obviously is not no longer with us but uh\nIt just they slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences you know of of when you get here and then now they're actually given them benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five ... go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I could get a\nHold on I'm sure there's a lot\nThere here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they've got a job\nThat means they buy their lied about their documentation or they were using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument is that complete and total nonsense if someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThey are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had been truly and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Kent in Los Angeles where my my adopted my my first adopted home now Washington is my second adopted him you're listening on the great age seven to the answer Carol a or a tense what do you make of this\nAll right um [noise] I wanted to talk to people about getting out and\nVote in a case that false pole and ah [noise] are convinced chauffeur showing and slander also discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd the overall media onslaught discourage many conservatives those on the right from voting mhm they're only about Seventy percent of the U.S in the coming years for an older voted for President Trump in the primary\nIn about twenty five percent of the general for you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting I think actually most of them would vote conservative is they're going to have voted\nYet it can do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent they they're I mean what was the last time they were accurate\nYeah well I think often that's probably the case but it's similar to the fore Anders that people don't actually believe the frontrunners for what they believe is that other people will believe him and they won't get out\nThe vote share they think that\nThat lives in ... that is definitely the danger and and and Ken thank you for the call out there in LA uh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying and going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the the cabin on\nHearing I still believe resonates and I
