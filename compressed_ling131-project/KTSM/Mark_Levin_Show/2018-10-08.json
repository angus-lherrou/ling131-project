of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court\nThey thought they'd have a six three\nMajority with the president Hillary Clinton right now as well rain and\nQuite work out that way now than it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than Anthony Kennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\n[noise] the liberals are now attacking the court's not listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but her which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years how about a really hard time\nDoing one thing they can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it no I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had that at the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen\nBut the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on demand Bob yeah a basic income\nMedicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for\nThat\nOne of the national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand\nOn it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it\nIt is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the the the you're just get a bunch\nOf liberals pretending to be judges on the court to choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work of knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie or a DMV excuse me or whenever the deal is they can't run that either\nThey convincing them that that's good for them\nYou can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them\nThey're starting to now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen shot all of this\nBecause there may unfortunately become a time when they\nTake back a majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back\nAt them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy and the Supreme Court that matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything there's actual principles their principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is Jenny afflicting before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use to get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is if the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is only to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the court should be deciding things
