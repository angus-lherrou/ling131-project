endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron does Santa's for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nThe lights are from the story a major union for police officers the Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently using demographic that is a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway well it's a lot of time he actually was a Republican governor and in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the party what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran does say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police had been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to\nThis hose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sudden gentle he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother said their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over it's game over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look in in I was tracking violence towards police officers remember\nBefore the whole Kaepernick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police\nOfficers in this country and I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida that tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you\nYou might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance but here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now\nThey fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen five hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement\nOf those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and for about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups\nBy media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah
