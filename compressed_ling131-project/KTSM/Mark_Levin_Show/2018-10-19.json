could ever make if you really love and care about women the last thing you would do is give money to Planned Parenthood but that's how the left thinks that's how Hollywood things\nAnd the me too movement as it it came forward under Harvey Weinstein and some of the other allegations of Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and they're all Democrats have you noticed\nThere all liberals they're all they're all in the media for that matter but what they had in common that we didn't see in the cabin uh proceedings was that there was immediately floodgates opened up other valid\nCorroborated\nCompletely credible allegations what we saw with Kavanaugh were a couple of other allegations you know led by the likes of Michael ...\nThere were completely incredible\n... locked any corroboration lack any consistency\nBut what you saw with the cabin up thing was the politicization of the me too movement you saw me to use as a political weapon to destroy somebody because ultimately they didn't like their politics it was just the last quiver in their\n... wait the less arrow in their quiver you know what I mean\nIt was the last weapon at their disposal they tried everything else God Knows during those confirmation hearings and this one they secretly surreptitiously held back and then threw it out there as their final attack\nThat's all it was and it was despicable and it was dishonorable\nAnd it went against everything that we in America stand for innocent until proven guilty due process\nAnd when I talk to women they were outraged at the Democrats about that\nAnd then something happened first of all Democrats aren't talking about it anymore which tells me you know they get it and they think that this is a loser for them if they spend too much

way\nAnd I'm hearing that the suburban women\nThey're mad\nAnd they're not mad at the Democrats ... this me to sing is resonating with them that it's actually motivating their vote that there is a real danger for Republicans right now that they could lose the house because of this\nBut Democrats can overplay their hand so it's just sort of under the radar\nNow the beauty of filling in for Merkel have been here on the ... coast to coast is that\nThere are a whole lot of suburban women listening\nRight now and I want to hear from you\nIf you are a suburban woman\nWhere do you stand right now on this thing and more importantly what are your friends saying 'cause I'm thinking if you listen to this program you might have already made up your mind and you might be voting Republican but that doesn't mean that all your friends and family\nAre Republicans you know when when you hang out with your girlfriends when you're standing on the sidelines of a soccer game and you're having

not seeing and that that's what's going to give the Democrats the majority\nNo I I Hope that's not not true and I wondered if you heard about the walk away campaign oh sure yeah I'm planning to stay there and you know other than in Fort Worth and I'm about five of us are going to go there\nAnd fight cart and I just I think it's going to be I think we're going to fill out the the with a bunch of

Democrat people who fit the traditional demographic of Democrats they're African Americans Latino minorities women who have a ... as seen through it all now when they're just it's okay to walk away from the party right now\nThat's right and I started with a couple of people that were like ... rocket that was walking away from the Democrat Party that now what is it just didn't want to walk away from her pack or the the violent or\nJust what we've seen in the streets and what we saw during the cabinet on hearing is not with just chill and he said he wanted to hear from what they thought about

just outrageous\n[noise] yeah ... thank you you put it very Well Nancy ... ... ... ... the the me too movement or or me two story line it was co opted by the Democrats in and used it was politicized against this one man it wasn't about a moving it wasn't about women it was about him\n[laughter] yeah but it it was just so frustrating to just watch that everything that came out that was not true yeah it's not even calling it out of the of course and then you have the media or anything just all about\nIt's all about what was wrong with them and said that he was a little bit angry at that last hearing okay let me this is so low that craving that wasn't getting ...\nNancy thank you for the call to the morgue within show if he weren't angry I Would have been concerned about him that I think
