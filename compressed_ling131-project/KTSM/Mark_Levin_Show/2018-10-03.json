have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed\nTo a a electronically and provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great well you've never seen that peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of your a familiar with New York city aren't you all those buildings with the president's name on he created this\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\n\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and buzz for his father he couldn't succeed\nThere's some concern about that and they go on about how he he's a tax ... first of all as I understood it these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks chi has he been adjudicated attacks cheat now has he been adjudicated attack street administratively or judicial you know\nNobody has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\nAnd of course the goal is to pay is lower taxes as possible\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted is used underwear remember that Mr producing\n\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing pay my bill the damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nThe New York times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act multiple times or Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broderick and been molested so many other women now it's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it it's the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remember Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSort of this big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate again everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times because the New York times is always right don't you know\nThe New York times is never wrong\n\nWe have ah the ... the mayor
