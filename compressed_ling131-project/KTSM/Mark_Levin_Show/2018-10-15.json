according to CNN the Saudi kingdom is preparing to release a statement saying his show he was killed during an interrogation gone wrong\nOf course they're going to do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they hadn't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course and how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance he re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the\nAmerican people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical Trump knows that Trump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nWhat does he do we reframe sit [noise] Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listened she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be the journalists right\nShe automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all that's Trump's ammo he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\n\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activist takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paid for this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy the benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hit the hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in any did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did\nBut to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of fraud in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic\nWho they're they based their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\nI mean who what\nOther president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere anywhere in the in the entire movement could have gotten a ...\nA major party presidential candidate twenty and twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's\nPossibly one one thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go ... go places embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans

cells because of an authenticity that authenticity is not necessarily without battle scars I'm not suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with the American people is\nHe's a plane speaking authentic guy says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense this cells\nNow I bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall I Know it because I've got friends\nOf mine who were union workers up in New York I'm not going to say who because honest to God I'm afraid they'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great to be with\nContrast that with the frauds and the Democrat side Elizabeth\nWarren putting out a press conference press release today that she won five trillion Native American or whatever it was one one thousand and twenty four to whatever is so ridiculous the guy running against cruise in Texas who whose whose entire campaign seems to be the skate boards he can skateboard\nAnd play the guitar as if this is that's great that's wonderful what the hell does that have to do with tax policy anything at all pleased your your who cares\nThen you've got these Bernie Sanders you know foreign left radical left is tied she got this guy Andrew Gillum running down here for governor in Florida he's got their socialist they don't want your money they want the whole economy\nAnd they try to frame it in this oh you've got to have rich people the rich people are getting over they're not paying their fair share really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today but it's a fascinating piece and Bloomberg of all I'm not a big\nHuge fan of the Web but once in a while they have good articles that economic and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIf I say let me just say something numbers so much it's the comparison\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners\nPay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country I think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute\nYou may say okay well you know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent\nFew liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff pays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nSo pick about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... they don't pay that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not the Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts\nOver with that yeah you know what they pay a lot actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job\nThe top\nOne percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the\nBottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share if that's not you hear what I'm ... there's more by this isn't just that\nThere's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg peace again not or some right wing website\nHere I mean your son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening will be like no you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty why is this so sensitive\nTo make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have we had Al Sharpton at his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nIf you want to save a whole

now\nAnd the reason I bring it up is because they are good at staying on message that's how they get these myths to persist over time Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Spartacus you got one guy on ice skate board in the parking lot better if you got one guy talking about\nFart jokes at a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\n\nI fundamentally disagree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I've always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it\nAre so overtaken with rage at\nThis guy represents the anti swab rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruths them straight up live they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\nHe's got them talking about\nBooth failing in Senate hearings he's got a Cory Booker declaring he's a sporadic is from the or at least you're silverstone clueless movie\nHe's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I'm One one thousand Native American jobs by the way to Fox on in the background the Cherokee Nation just responded and and in a brutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who will\nWhat was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media turns it back on them\nHe ends he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview\nMaking sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans this is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and they're swamp brat Democrats back on their heels because they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I've said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is done apologizing\nFor taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happened to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not given tax cuts to the rich why why are we not doing that\nWhy well because it'll look bad well is it\nGood for the economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make\nSomething it's such a was\nMake the case Trump does if\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head that the fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pays the same percentage of income tax\nThree percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\n... do you understand the gravity of what I just told you for teen hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country\n... liberal delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a was a one percent of one percent or\nWill still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn it you might as well burn it you're flushing it down the toilet\n\nMilton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while either [noise]\nIt's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great milk treatment he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster [noise]\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right you spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money but the quality of what you're purchasing batters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy\nSuffers going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost\nOf what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest film little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying\nMatter so much it's not yours\n\nOther people there's another way to be even less efficient other people\nCan't spend other people's money on themselves you go on a work trip you your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people's spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room\nThis quality matter yeah you're damn right is your hotel room you want the best hotel room out there but the cost that no\nNo it doesn't matter if the jobs money you know yours give me the the the the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it cost them matter you may say wow that sounds like a really an official way to spend money on it gets worse it gets even worse [noise]\n\nOther people spending other people's money on other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never run here the spokes other people's spending other people's money and other people what is that if the government it is the the the cesspool of government taking good tax dollars to think about the government's taking your money and spending it on other people does\nIt cost matter how low it ain't their money they don't care what they're buying this equality\nMatter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care they're just giving\nPeople money while working to pay for their health care yeah but it's crappy health care out we don't care it's taxpayer money whatever just go to spend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst possible way to spend my the government's better off taking your tax dollars\nAnd buying themselves lamborghini's at least they look for quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it on the people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nFreedman was a genius a genius\nYou know understand why it is an imperative to not fall into this gas lighting trap that we're not paying their fair share your fair share is as much as you can keep it is possible because every dollar over that amount to fund our military and the constitutional role of government is wasted by people who don't care about the cost or the quality of what they buy beer centrally flushing\nYour money down the toilet bowl that's a fact jak\nWe need the Reagan days ... when Reagan made the argument that government is the problem in Trump's doing that right now\nYou're just force their hand in Congress to get a lid on some of the spending we'd be a okay All right I got to take a break\nIn the long hair [laughter] I'm damn bungee no in
