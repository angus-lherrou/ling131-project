information to the top levels of the FBI this information according to what happened was this according to what they say happen to people who were in the room was\nDisclosed by James Baker who was a senior level legal counsel guy and the FBI he was not a field office Scott this is a headquarters level high level guy knew that drops this bomb this weekend that before the fight was even launched\nThis guy Sussman\nWith a Democrat legal law firms work doing work for the DNC and Hillary was shuffling information to this guy according to bakers testimony folks this may seem like a

know you watch what happens you arrest them and you see that you know the kid comes out of the room and you're like I just have this sensitivity the abuse of government power having had it at one point\nAnd watching what happened then all of the flashing red lights that were blown through by the Democrats and the Obama administration to spy on the Trump team disturbs me\nThink about what we're saying here noon ask came out and bought a Romo show this weekend and said that a political for a law firm hired by political campaign was feeding information not to a field office not to a low level FBI guy to a senior level attorney and the Federal Bureau of investigation\nFor the explicit purpose of spying on a presidential candidate folks the Spygate\nDisaster is really three sub scandals right if the information superhighway I'll get to that\nIt's this spying scandal the coordinated effort to actually use intelligence assets to spy on a political campaign\nAnd it's the set up\nThere actually three sub scandals in this entire debacle this collusion fabrication the part I'm referencing now new now summary of barter Romo show is the information superhighway\nThat's what I call\nThe information superhighway was an effort by\nDemocrat Party operatives\nThey're paid contractors whether they be law firms are opposition researchers was an effort by them to shuttle negative information about Trump and his team information most of it that turned out later on to be completely false\nIt was the effort to get that information into the bloodstream of the department of justice and the FBI\nThrough ivy while bypassing them out\nThey weren't going to feed it to him because then it would have to go through the GI track that if it was poisoned the stomach as ways of dealing with that they wanted this main line right into the bloodstream\n\nThey needed to bypass all of those body protections that the D. OJ and the FBI half\nThe vetting of information the woods procedure where they've had information through multiple channels the vetting of sources the ah you know credibility checks I listen you're telling us to stop but this is a political opponent of yours like you this is political apple research right they want it to bypass all of that the information superhighway was a way to do this\nThe way to do was to go right to the top of the FBI and not to the field office guys the guys actually doing the hard work investigating the kidnappings across state lines that bank\nRobberies the terrorism cases they didn't bring their information to them they brought their information to the top level guys the suits who they knew where politicians before they were cops and they bypass all of those legal protections\nThey did it into the FBI to what noon yes revealed this weekend by shuttling this up to a lawyer right into the top levels of the FBI\nHow did they do it and the the OJ the information superhighway was obvious in the D. or J.\nThey mainline their right to Bruce or who was the number four official into the OJ but was actually meeting with Christopher Steele who was paid to do this what\nWhat new test revealed this week Ken was a pivotal key piece of information\nAbout what makes this even more devastating and more profound 'cause I get it I totally understand\nWhere the lives are going to go with this for water a guy had information or people pass information off that no no no that's not the way that works\n\nThey'll typically passage through a field office that will investigate the vet the information they'll go into a court of law there'll be a grand jury at some point there will be some adversarial hearing either at some initial appearance later on or a trial\nThat's not what they did they walked into a fight as a court where there was no ability for the Trump deep to defend themselves at all they brought information that was paid for by the Democrats and and and the real kicker here\n\nThe bureau lied about it\nJim Comey and others insisted\nThat they didn't know where a lot of this information was coming from they didn't understand the political origins of it ladies and gentleman\nThat is clearly a lie a fabrication at this point that is clearly made up they were meeting with the lawyer who was being paid by the DNC\nIt was a fabrication it was made up\nIt was nonsense why with the bureau lie about it these upper level managers if they had nothing to hide this is I I mean this answer this question answers itself\n\nThe information superhighway it was an effort to bypass all of these protections folks\nThis case is disgusting it is a grotesque abusive power when all the information comes out you're going to look at this you're going to read this I have this stuff in my book and you're going to sit there and say to yourself how the heck did this happen in the United states of America\nThe key now is to not let it happen again\nAnd I got more and this and the other side of the break a seven seven three one three one one if you want to give us a call eight seven seven three one three and one one I'm damn bunch you know in from work then we'll be right back\nHim ...\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll still students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at low vision for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

principal at old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and that's a presumption of innocence supplies and that's some sort of sub sent a tipping procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not just one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office that Trump's scored a hundred and Democrats scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico\nTrade battle is won by Trump including South Korea next fall will be the God does he does in Beijing and communist red China that\nTakes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea and now according harassed most and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost look like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit he hits back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh your an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only half stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and laws go spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of look ... looked over Trump and said that's my motto\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other whip the middle aged judge from Yale headed in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance\nAnd eloquence all of his or all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine Ford she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and you and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth well as she lied or not to a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she relates to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now\nShe says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen nod or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said at the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics enter the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room\nSo the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is the disease swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up\nOn Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S

severe weather center this is cheap meteorologist Sandra did [noise]\nThings are getting a little more normal\nLet's continue with the U.S marine calls I always\nListen I Love Marines love what they stand for my daddy was a marine John in Washington DC I get Marines presidents here don't cutting them in from our limited John please go ahead\nAnd show following this thing or you can only from start to where it is now and you're opening first off factor stuff aren't they were\nJust guy looked strictly go off the values of the country that you tell a joke it's absolutely mind boggling to no kidding and this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about uh how unfair it was that the president declared a innocent a bread ... isn't that what are you\nAren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't a case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christine afford down to perform rose path when she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector test and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend or Christina Ford and by the white Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend is told his credit cards but I redress\nOr what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath through a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward to the Ninety nine he said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam and\nSo practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt\nThat is the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic is actually\nA lot of [laughter] that's that's terrified because you now hey take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just they're all coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the fear factor and it can be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life is\nWhat John Waters threats Kevin all go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight\nOn [laughter] that would that would be on the road and wouldn't you\nKnow but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such\nAnd you know John I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say what do what you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project\nHas listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later who were wrongly convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry to black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a host or university case were for\nCollege man that hubs or were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow student\nIt came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused is somewhat of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story occur seeing afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both\nCom or called eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible met a share dot com or eight six six eighty eight Bible\nLiberal elites widowed does some common sense from Muslims in\n\n\nOne\nThing can I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about the norms of the presidency\nLet's talk about norms of presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assault and Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky then he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncreased taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you add Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is that the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the president's even LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water grade in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the president's so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow violating the norms of the presidency as if Obama and Bush and Clinton and Bush\nAnd LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the president say please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing a Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley role he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction they encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that would otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm Liz listen to the liberal media today because they think drop last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and\nIt was terrible ... and\nAnother point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November or December the twenty sixteen men I might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAnd aren't heaven they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that Jeanette bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as\nHow about accepting the results of the election whether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nJeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also tests that they will not acknowledge\nAnything good anything could be\nAs good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has died Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm\nI'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries he tried hard hard working man for a million doesn't have to do it right I have respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today Sharon we got her run thank you for your call from Pennsylvania Senate such Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote\nIf you do not one Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out and vote must continue with more eight seven seven three one

Ford which is why she has been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what you told a therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her inner ...\nTeens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in our mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens have became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine Ford\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle\nDo I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist who rented a room in our house that caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to write me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties and then some out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys is that it was one instead of late teens that I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make at Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics to Stamford University and she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime\nDying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them required her to come forward and won the Senate said\nWhen the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have

client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this
