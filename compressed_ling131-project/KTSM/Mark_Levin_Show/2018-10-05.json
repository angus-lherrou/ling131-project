I'm Brian ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court is looking very likely to key swing votes fell into Kevin O's corner this afternoon Maine Republican Susan Collins and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin Collins believes the sexual assault allegations against Kevin ... are not enough for her to vote no\nThat's a false premise and guess what\nYou'll lose\nBut we all do so that's the the first the most important thing the second is that there are two sides to stories\nIn one side effects now here the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy last Thursday and bless her heart Susan Collins\nWho delivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying at any point today one that oh my God Chuck Grassley\nWho's left who got a spy will spunky\nAnd Susan Collins Susan Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened here at a at a lot of interesting the interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stores and one side effects on Thursday you have so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who is unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and uh you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people yeah you know they both were known and we're not no day we're not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available is Christine four seats filled out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her that she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world\nOf the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury they should they should there should be a full investigation offer but as long as I have an opportunity to do so what she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said\nIt's wrong that's wrong and it's important that when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine Ford they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\nAbsolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do the right Gavin I'm One hundred percent certain\nHe was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively ruin that man's life\nFamily's life\nHow evil do you have to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just laid off because breakdown is going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs Tucson I'm not trying to rub it in ... I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\nNot and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are\nWe're on a ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes in right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the\nPremise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake has meant that kind of a couple of weeks to kind of three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand what Kavanaugh's been through an emotionally there was kind of feel like we were through another election here for the soul cabin on thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line by the way I mentioned on ...\nYourself for the friends I don't want to show my home station W.

probably like Thirteen Years old but uh yeah a flea market Montgomery ... mini mall living rooms bedrooms dine that's oh yeah and you can find that the market and the saddest thing about flea market Montgomery\nIs that it it went down during the recession that was that was maybe one of the saddest moments during the entire great recession anyway are now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery isn't there'll be a there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have doors in the in the walls I just\nOh by the way I Am Brian mud and for the great one more to live in and uh get to some of your calls here and just a moment by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just to go straight to the FBI boys\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have received and [noise] the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone is to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people and this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberals there are a lot of close minded conservatives to but you've got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm gala that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you needed all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just going to view you as someone who is highly political train that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable or is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive and looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being illegal to drink the youngest one's my oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah and you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're

a wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately\nAround that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nI took him four and Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... uh it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so uh the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something interesting that\nDeveloped out of Alaska Lisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no you did not want to end debate then again if debate did not end today basically Kevin I would've been dead they would have been it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical so with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office hours phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like at least some might now actually be reconsidering\nOr taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looks like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nHave known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean it's one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabin on the ...\nOr ... that man what he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what a think Brett Kavanaugh's role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in pain detention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's kind of Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids with somebody\nThat seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right places they just the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this and it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYeah there are a lot of things about our government we complain about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moments\nAnd we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does it the right way doesn't back down\nI'm Brian must we'll be right back I'm In for the gray one article that\nFor years the player count climbed parents at the John Hancock center in Chicago

Bush in the wake of nine eleven\nSo it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happen this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate map favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was likely to be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten points where the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia that voted yes Joe mansion by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on backup this\nAgain when I've been taking a look information on how much this vote meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump broke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you take a lot of getting ... if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nMy question is and this is what I'm working out because again I base everything off of information are we add an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression not after nine eleven\nBut if you're looking for a ... D absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton but\nThen again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the more investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house I could be analogous you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment in time than inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there is an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one\nHim [noise]\nI Can't

with judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my uh as I listen carefully to the testimony ethics committee hearing I spoke with people who knew him hers planes sections ...\nAnd many happens [noise]\nThe uh [noise] approaching\nThe lack of enthusiasm in her voice pull you\nSusan Collins had her find this moment in fact\nAnd I'm Still shocked by it the finest moment I think any United States Senate or is that at least that I have witnessed still almost beyond belief\nOr if you did not catch Susan Collins her speech\nEarlier today it is definitely a must listen and watch it so I take it in for sure she really ended up a lean down\nAnd uh want to get some of your thoughts so let's go to many in Anchorage, Alaska and I understand that uh you're you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of hey senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it was on the for the Senate then have all the trappings but Lindsay made those that are members on that and Judiciary Committee either eat their spinach\nOkay exactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of\nBattle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing that's kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that um [noise]\nThey they never Trump earthquake in college was why we used to like ... was one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had sent the attendance at Trump's rally they have been they had four or five I've lost count he's like\nEnergizer Bunny [laughter] they they and and then the as some of those rallies\nWhen President Trump was mentioned cabin I now I Am sure you heard that too\nUm and so I just I I think Collins for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having a\nParty in there to\nReally say what they said to those members of that condition committee that were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of [laughter] but you know I Would agree with you is the probably Lindsey Graham sinus moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote\nAnd I was surprised when we talk eastern time but Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where it's better now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ends up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I were the cancer that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to fix up here I had lost every day and believe me the people I Can't remember very many call for a new one hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have man I'm\nI'm way how she votes for a ... a cabin on\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back those comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although it should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's not going to alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nHey thank you sir [noise] hey I'm I was watching and listening to a sinner calling

importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry and they need to lessen the damage and they do run damage control they lessened the damage to them that's what I saw I think it actually her ... her speech was scripted\nShe did not speak like the\nProtests was written so I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to
