dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects [noise] run to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there it's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what the lobbyists did is they arrange a number of excursion one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city\nOf but this guy God Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the like Campbell and I mean people hear about the Hamilton pick addicted to like go to the movie tickets or at least\nThousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that\nAndrew's lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that but then those same lobbyists also arranged a luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up costs and about a thousand dollars a for Andrew and his wife uh in addition to some other folks and getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around\nAnd he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for and so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted\nIs denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line is it still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation\nBut mark you are very smart and the law you understand the stuff what an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now the reason you would do such a thing\nOf course nobody knows the peace in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people him\nOh it's it's ... it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean that that that might just\nFor your um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem and his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put it in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrews not subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to

force and the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth and you know you're going in the right direction well the answer is easy it depends upon which way you do right\n[noise] well no that's not right my friend Dr Larry yarn president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that that they've been taught to say that you and I know that that's the wrong answer\nLet me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College in Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth\nHillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way for us by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history and they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things the good the true and the beautiful\nHillsdale holds a unique an important role in American education today I encourage all of you my beloved listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution that live in for Hillsdale dot com that's lived in Hillsdale dot com L. E. V. I. and free Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nNot ladies and gentlemen I I have a solution for this\nUh they called a caravan\nThis invasion that's taking place [noise] I have a solution I posted up on Facebook and is this\nThe a prime minister of Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau trip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past I we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants from all parts\nOf the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who are trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do [noise]\nUnited States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got seven to fourteen thousand people coming here illegally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of\nRay how buses and we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico\nDoes it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drives them to our northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants them\nThese people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume they're how ...\nEven though they're carrying their flags\nAnd in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving there how halls Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea of Mr produce\nAnd on top of that\nLike a greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use\nSo that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan\nHa a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use Hooper too I don't care if we can use uber can use taxis greyhound whatever\nI'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhile Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever lip and number two if not if we have a regular American\n\nMike in Maryland the great WMA I'll go\nHey Margaret talking to you a first time caller thank you sir yeah on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push this guy was that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly account of attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they pick the five and then there for five\nAnd ... that's my point is you know they went back and forth but it's the it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it showed ... through I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that is the orders that the Democrats the way that the Democrat\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentlemen this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb and two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally played all the time well if the president we keep them as it has nothing to do with the president and as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's his supporters us who are called\nNeo Nazis and racists it's the

tone down here toned down immediately out of the ... sucker who's responsible for CNN\nPuts out a statement without knowing anything blaming Trump\nJake Tapper such a fool he goes on the air like John
