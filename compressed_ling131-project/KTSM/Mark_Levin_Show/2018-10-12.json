I mean President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially this bond is Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno ... so maybe you know as long as you're not the respond or saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo still wants to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights\nAnd therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day\nThere are five now what does that mean well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you start out and on that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than ... I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around need to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and went frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality it's brought a bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody said well her witnesses the ones that ended up repeating her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this lesser said\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as your own reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you getting me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five or six or seven and eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they where they\nAre they fix is not a good day in threes on a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people\nOf things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to information the first place and the problem is that a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there are only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent there everything that's it\nSo you got to find people that are open minded and open to information as pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because any more\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live in\nSo ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years remember the last time we were talking about Kanye

Bush was raised is\nNo [laughter] I said go\nDuring the country and the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was ... by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that everything was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watch that little uh the total series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look a gun you look at the teleprompter and look at gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah\nAnd and then his\nBack and then we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers\nPicks up it starts reading the teleprompter and all the time moment anyway no I I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to introduce policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThey can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community at the Donald Trump story she can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible\nAnd told you had to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing never forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\n[laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know I keep going be [noise] I I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office doing a an employment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place\nAnd I can tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nI was like OK gets off the bone and she tells me you know what to do just happen Senate making too much money single mother she's a single mother\nAnd she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that are again James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had\nWe had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties why didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good in the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well I of course open change when there was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep all my government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping the economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you say\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue garde I was not a Republican\nAt least not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nLocation closest to you were\nYou'll also find lots of shifts to simplify your recycling like asking the store

thrown\n[laughter] tiny a\nIdea everybody All right so\nIt's been an interesting couple of days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility\nAnd the most pervasive form a bias in the media which happens to be old mission now they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of dispersed that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center\n... news busters now Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media the negative Ninety two percent of you you compare it to Iraq Obama the same point about forty six percent negative\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years into the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou'll have the media\nMedia is always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval rating\nBut there's been a truism pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same but among likely voters we can\nYou just see it rise you'll see some pulling rats was at one point this we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to ... bombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\n... it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is ... and in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll at the lives that were thrown out there where perpetuated while that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obama Care is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nAnd that and many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nYou know mental they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better knees are all things that our backs and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIs why we might actually be a one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not\nLosing and this presidential election cycle [noise]\nThese are all the things that are on the table something else [noise] but you can't lie to people about [noise] you can't lie to people about financial fraud and we're gonna talk about that\nAnd Medicare for all coming up next because Medicare for all is the biggest financial fraud\nEver for such a way I'm Brian mud and for the gray one more glued to our way\nAnd now look back to this week in history\nThis week in Eighteen forty five of the United States Naval academy opens in Annapolis, Maryland with ... ... students and seven professors the naval school officially became the U.S Naval Academy and he's he's fifty and a new curriculum went into effect requiring misshapen to study at the academy for four years\nAnd to train aboard ships each summer the basic format that remains at the academy to this day this week in Nineteen sixty eight Apollo seven in the first manned Apollo mission is launch with astronauts Walter Shearer junior done he saw and Walter Cunningham aboard\nUnder the command of sheer it'd be crew of Apollo seven conducted an eleven de orbit of the earth during which the crew transmitted the first live television broadcast from more of a [noise]\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy five the ethics single born to run became Bruce Springsteen first every top forty hitter marking the start of his eventual transition from little known coach figure to international superstar twenty six year old Bruce Springsteen had too heavily promoted major label albums behind him nothing approaching a popular ...\nAnd also this week in Nineteen Seventy five Saturday Night live debuts on NBC featuring Chevy Chase jumble ooh she Dan Ackroyd Gilda Radner Garrett Maurice Jane Curtain and Lorraine Newman it will go on to become the longest running highest\nRated show on late night TV Ninety minute program which from its inception had been broadcast live includes a different guest host of musical acts\nEach week the opening

dog food dot com [laughter] friday\nAfterwards well what's new today on the free I her radio a radio\nLast perfect for decorating the house or just setting the scary mood\nPumpkins by the pilot has she'll tracks with labor in my lifetime we've got a bond yeah everyone's talking about like the fantasy football or bobcat than Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music\nSee news radio I'm Brian shook the president has plans to meet with fried American pastor Andrew Brunson at the White House soon Trump told reporters that Brunson released from captivity is very good news and that no special concessions were made with no deal man [noise]\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points\nReal quickly and here's the first one if\nAlready are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare\n... percent that's it you got a hundred\nPercent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nIt is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to order discriminatory all race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this and this was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott\nWho was term limited and running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians no no\nYou won't have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what\nHappen we've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats and our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support you end up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with us money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so as you hear Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's got to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've gotten much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating not making it up it's according to federal federal has a basic financial literacy tests\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults fail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they're financially illiterate than these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nBut it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about another\nThing time fraud perpetuated on us the minimum wage who earns it pretty much nobody and that's the dirty little secret talking about that next I'm Brian mud and for the great one month\nHim ...\nYou know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you

people dumped herbal but you gotta gotta feeling that for once you've got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's a complicated and and this is the way the shutdown dropped the Mike argument you have a Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pacing insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks at work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country\nAnd it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again not my opinion\nProven by federal sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational you\nBut here's something else that is a frog that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person net take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts so\nIt's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had to actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody's uh I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything\nNow the next part that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all their stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little\nGuy you know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well as dishonest to its ally the or CNBC you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] they had the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC with their CFO council\nHave found a a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not ... percent of the corporate tax cuts\nThe sheer buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rates rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer bat buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary\nVotes to proceed towards impeaching President Bill Clinton on
