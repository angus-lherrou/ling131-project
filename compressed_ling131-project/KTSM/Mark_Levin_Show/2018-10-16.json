weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case happened a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice and at the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks ah here's what happened this week and let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on Mars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie you say with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter] [noise]\nThe Donald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer wars issue to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even buy a use liberal footnotes that way to liberals can't refuse what they said in the past on it\nBut the cases very simple in its essence ... opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper levels of their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it [noise] now\nWhy am I bring that up now not to give you like oh well that's great what else is there are lots to talk about bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe\nUnleashed they just the port of information and Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times\nThat they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos that as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha back\nThat's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you folks the reason the story keeps changing\nIt was they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there no shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advance by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this too is now George\nPapadopoulos that George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information in there you go bingo we got\nWell thank you gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight as a court there is a ... process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this book sometimes a little complicated but you have a bit of federal agents [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ... and here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now\nIs married to this latest narrative this is all they have if the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information that guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole ... that's why this is so critical now what's the big question here\nHow you can save hundreds on liberties

down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck ... junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nWho coined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage\nSuch as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way he was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nAnd makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's a legitimate use as well also this honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes the dynamite any questions\nYeah you can

...\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and they're just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake to me like you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you can move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a a story I'm actually working for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration at for info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes up\nOr did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida over the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independents that have registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy\nWe have the best economy in a generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck the hero bomb and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then he got the mines that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out\nOh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I received the notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary than the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I see a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years fans are is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if the word less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it\nYou take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've always kept to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as peacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration said that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back up here on the other side I Am Brian mud and for the great one month\nHim [noise]\nAsk
