that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\n... and I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done\nAnd you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey whoever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five\nTrump as a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out everyday between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy is the messiah or a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz would have done but crews doesn't add the magnetism doesn't have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies it looked like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circuit twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to write that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes are open and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald it you know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence fate and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nImagine if Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme

hurricane will be storm surge which could be up to Thirteen feet in some areas\nYeah I agree it's horrible\nIt's horrible and and tape was behind this you know I'm watching on Fox right now to my right ah and I'm watching the left as protesters takeover\nIntersections of Portland, Oregon and the downtown section pulling out white people beating on their car and using using racial epithets against them\nAnd you know what can happen is\nHard to prove this a\nHate crime they wouldn't be hard to prove they hate us\nIt's not going to happen in Oregon I guess but what about the U.S department of justice doing it what about Jeff Sessions in the FBI and all the rest of what about that\n[noise] I agree that's where should come from the top\nYou know in Charlottesville will not one

Charlottesville yelling about Jews you're talking to a guy this practice law would choose most of my professional life I'm disgusted by that\nAre running around Charlottesville at night with tiki torches talking about the N word and about Jews that's bad stuff it happens but ten times that stuff\nHappens on the left all the time and it's never confronted in reality for what it is which is hate from the left there's much more hate from the left and from the right there's many more hate crimes on the left and on the right but they're never prosecuted that why are they\nNo no they're not\nWell

mayor be charged for aiding and abetting um those soldiers\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statue the deals with\nOne state authorities actor under act on the color of state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon as part of an unspoken conspiracy the object of which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals in front of Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals\nThis happen in Washington DC\nThis was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so is that the NIH the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking overs intersections in a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking wide citizens\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight\nOf Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable this was wrong it can happen in

of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years what are you willing to do to stop at\nAge seven seven three one three eight one one\nIt started yesterday on CNN well\nActually forgive me it started early in the morning yesterday in the Washington\nPost these things happen and they're all coordinated have you noticed that the Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob\nAnd then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump\n... republic as aboutcom Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican\nBut he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast and that but he's a good guy and I know that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies they were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered bench Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows and small wars\n\nIn the more the words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob I'm not going to use the word ... totally ... it is without a doubt that there's no other word is that they\nPut a stop what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her ... joined her she got her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa Bob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville [noise]\nUh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests of ... and the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ...\nIf they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think pro ball one would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think it's easily and yeah and if there are the party as we call it um out for sure come on like this area\nYeah so that's Mary under him jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual ripped bald and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville side of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that a real fast Richard\nLet me let me let me let me live past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the weaponization of of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... he now says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally where he first raised this issue and\nUh and and she's apparently right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective against the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook\nWill start at silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling a mob mob\nBecause it's correct\nAnd it's working because no normative American wants to vote for the mob party\nAnd put them into power President Trump in a brilliant brilliant line in his rally Saturday Night late this out I'm In a play that for you in a

their base they've decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob\nThat's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the committee hearings they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets to get in\nThey knew what was

are still sitting and still languishing without any action from the Senate\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrat Chuck Schumer he said he said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment of fight\nTo the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would do manned the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called ... deferential act it's called respect for our American government it's called a a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed\nSo that it can function but the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nUh let me read this or much of this editorial for you you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation GOP majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell has felt cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor of vote for nearly a year\nThink about that you want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats are suppose they're supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations just fill basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey bastard Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights\nThird is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand this\n\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey buster clerk to run the environment and natural resources division at the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump is put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy he was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a\nYear we had no one Vassar and Germany and and once he got there boy he is is ... and then into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists ... Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get rid of Grinnell as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way it's because they didn't have as an acid or there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed closer this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing you to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want to slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what\nAre the Republicans do during Obama's first two years twelve\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirm more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he is now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\n\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from DC but it'd be a real shame if I force you to sit here for all these cloture votes in the next four weeks\nA quarter McCaskill hey you're not looking good in the polls there in Missouri I bet you like to go there and press the flesh and hand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now and he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n[noise]\nUh let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is here it is I was looking for the number earlier I was right outside it was close to two hundred\nOne hundred and Ninety eight nominations are backed up right now I'm awaiting confirmation there's no wonder can you imagine this is the defense department we're talking about this is the Pentagon there are positions and the Pentagon right now\nThat have been left unfilled nearly two years into this president's administration key positions at the Pentagon that involve national security that involve the functioning of our military\nAnd the Democrats don't care\nOne hundred and Ninety nominations backup awaiting confirmation according to the partnership for public service tracking the nominations range from State Department under secretary of Labor Department spots Charles Stimson was nominated in June twenty Seventeen to be general counsel of the navy\nI ... and posing for a moment I Know ... and he's a great guy I haven't really talked to him about this we trade attacks now and again I just say how you doing how you're doing you still don't have the vote right now is another vote don't have a vote I don't know what's going on June is twenty Seventeen college Simpson was nominated to be the uh counsel for the department of the navy\nGeneral counsel that means the top lawyer for the for the navy\nThis is a guy who is eminently qualified he has not only cleared committee once he's cleared committee twice he had to go back to committee a second time\nA for something I Can't remember I think they changed the makeup of the committee he still they won't give this man the dignity of a vote on the floor he's the guy did sitting there treading water right now am I going to be working at the Pentagon and might not going to
