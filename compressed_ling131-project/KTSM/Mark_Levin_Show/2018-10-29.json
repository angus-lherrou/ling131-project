unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's there\nWhile it's you know a horrific act or worse anti Semitic attack and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nThat to meet with a members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders that Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start a and what I wanted to do with Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd they and Israel yesterday morning our government and they taught Sunday because some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday at there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we are the ones that I speak [laughter] that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your\nUh the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\n[noise] opening it is it's going to say a growing problem\nAh many people want to say that it began a two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned a thousand for ten and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups\nAnd the United states Jews were only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh\nUh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than it was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack Jews\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades\nIs that it once again become fashionable or to attack twos and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world scene attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six to the G federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you can have a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream is can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis that could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media is you have this rise of abuse online hate groups\nI think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous than it is giving them a sense of community of haters and I think it's important\nTo take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here and I know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your uh forties to see what they can do to\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now at the White House you clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] much\nHim no ...\nVia from Washington\nLaid off and try and keep our little kid's meal in a mommy and daddy hadn't eaten in while\nRoger from California and\nI'm grateful we could afford our son surgery nervous that now we can't really afford food\nDaniel from California choosing whether to pay the rent for ... to ... the car to get to work doesn't leave us with much more\nYou know we can't even prefer meals\nDonna from Louisiana [noise] doing just hid and we went from donating to the ...\nAn eating it\nKeeps you from South Carolina ... given meal so my two kids can eat but I'm I'm willing to really work on a\nHunger is the story recon arm and debt at Feeding America dot org brought to you by Feeding America and the ad council ... radio fantasy sports news updates [noise]\nThe Tampa Bay buccaneers and then she came as within ... with my\nDoctorate as their starting quarterback word Cleveland Browns if our head coach Hugh Jackson is signed Jackson amassed in almost ... record of ruins thirty six losses and one time during a press conference on Monday joins head coach pat German told reporters he like many will the new the New York's quarterback\nSolvent go to Adam days than lines and the hills throwing\nTheir remains quote a question of how much power you can put behind the ball in the NBA towards the ESPNs age or more now see the Cavaliers ... with a strong possibility that Kevin Love could miss more than a month for the west do injury James warned is unlikely to be clear ...\nSamaras Brooklyn was his hamstring injury both Anthony Davis and ... percent miss Monday is gone that five ... has been near ... radio network news of the fantasy sports radio network keywords fantasy on your heart radio as my daily\nSanity restoration I play every day [noise]\n\nA match very here that's right the fantasy football guy but you know what also a huge movie fan that's why I created fantasy movie would you pick reel movies each week to fill your virtual theater then you can speak to a movie tickets swag in more fantasy movie we dot com slash high hard to start playing today\nWhen you could use help closing your books and need additional staff it's time to call account temps they can provide you with bookkeepers and other accounting and finance professionals on a temporary or project basis and fast cold today account temp so Robert half company\nBut dump it into an twenty to him from a shelter a lot of people on the broadcast [noise]\nThat's just one adoption story to throw the butt of show business the shelter pet project out or to the pet theory brought you by Matisse humane society in the United states and the council Twain\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nAt Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth Hillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books\nThe greatest minds in history and they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at living for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I love post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and as you should be because ... she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turned around to vote no on Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh\nNo on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be we're out of step what does she running a New Yorker Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator for one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the old she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with ya her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or a ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the of the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars that expenditures from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up but Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat\nAnd you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and to have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think a less thirst for power the radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and that people want somebody's going to go be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on the health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you all oppose or ... or ... methods of protecting people who have pre existing conditions is that your position or see just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on it many times in our debates I support\nOf forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncluding health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance that's\nBecause of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell see if she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's where this is headed and we all know that that that she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge any major issue an issue of consequences and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagined what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are\nOr who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nBut you make a good point Medicare for all is Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan they have to abolish all private insurance and basically turn us into one ... right\nSome answers can only be found in nature discover the uncertain was just going to force
