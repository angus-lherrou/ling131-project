yes the president and his allies they need to dial down the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making journalists last day\nIs the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks putting into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nMeeting up on the media and also just sort of the violent rhetoric I'm calling Democrats a mob of saying that they support and that Thirteen and criminal I'm I'm kind of radical endanger it's such a staple of the way they talk\nAbout ... his opponent and you know I ...\nDid they do any of this when all that rice and or would be powder was being sent to Republicans to the Trump family to Trump to ... to ...\nTo

you're doing it right now look\nHe calls you fake news I Would say you're full of crap news quite frankly I think the president really let you off the hook he calls you fake news it's a passive term it's a relatively nice to him you know your fake fake effective if he doesn't color you are lying pack rats\nYou could do that but he hasn't done that and the irony is even while you're attacking him your proving his point aren't you the bubble people they live in their own bubble go ahead\nOf the rhetoric to push back then the president [noise] why has any but has Trump\nHold anybody in the media

here's what you know you hear a barn burner of his speech maybe get your riled up maybe or move to work harder defeat your political opponents\nBut people do not leave a political rally saying to themselves what he said about those bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy it's a sign of the times a reflection of the questioning of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect

great more pollution or using as an all creating as at all then you know the point is we don't need it anymore so why should the federal government impose Fifteen Percent ethanol in fuel\nAnd it's been a big push by the left all these years now because it was done for eight months a year to make it a twelve month issue that is the sale of IV Fifteen ethanol blend all year round not just for eight months\n\nWhile the Democrats didn't do this they Trump administrator and did all three of these things\nAll three of these things\nFord Motor company which I guess we're supposed to hate now has said that US Steel costs more than anywhere else in the world they're spending an extra one billion dollars on manufacturing automobiles and you can see right now automobile sales are flat for new automobile because the prices are\nUp several thousands of dollars\nSo millions and millions of people are affected by that and they don't even know it same with refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\n\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that as a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going up I support the American worker I support the American consumer I support the American economy America First means capitalism first\n\nPark I don't believe in free free markets pure free markets well nobody does because we don't have them and we've never had them but that doesn't mean you embrace these Bernie Sanders ... not so good drugs\n\nThe president's put out a dictate it's not even legal\n\nHe's put out a dictate through the department of ah what do they call health and Human Services\n\nThey want price transparency I don't have a problem with that\n\nWe all want price transparency but when they do the price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all\nShow us the taxes show us that cost show us the are indeed that went into that particular Madison another word you want transparency and give it all your muscle transparency that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cures for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dementia and Alzheimer's the amount of money that's being spent to try and find cures for diabetes and so forth money's being spent over and over again and really\n\nIn many ways or at least in some ways it's been quite beneficial people live longer than ever before\n\nYou know the government tried to regulate the cost of vaccines under Clinton and other administrations you know what happened we had one vaccine company left and they couldn't make enough vaccines and then they at a hospital so we had to import vaccines from Europe\nAnd other places\nWhen the government gets involved prices go up\nDemand goes up quality goes down availability goes down this\nIs a matter of fact it's not a matter of conservatism liberalism socialism capitalism is a fact it is experience it's provable\n\nSo now we're driving up the cost of consumer goods big consumer goods\nI'll give you another one\nAnd some of you on like this either because you know you're suspending irrationality and it's just a you're waving the flag a of a one party or another I don't care\nAs support this president doesn't mean I agree with everything I don't agree with what he's doing in these areas are winning bring them up\nThe tax cuts\nNew home sales are flat and starting to decline it's starting to happen with re sales now why is that\nWhile the media will tell you mostly\nThat it's because of increasing interest rates will interest rates are increasing but ladies and gentleman they're nowhere near high interest rates four percent four and a half percent many of us I've lived through eleven twelve Twenty one percent interest rates this is nothing historically it's minimal\nThat's not why\nWhy you know why Mr producer\n\nBecause you can't the duct all of your interest payments on mortgages and all your property taxes anymore\nThere's at ten thousand dollar threshold and it's doing exactly what I said it would do\nTo having a negative effect on home sales those if you want to resell your homes whether it's in a red state blue state I don't care you're in America it's harder to resell your home now\nAnd for builders who hire what we call construction workers and electricians and plumbers and Tyler's and brick workers and on and on and on all those men all those women are affected by this\n\nI Wish it was the greatest tax cut in American history but as it applies to individuals that simply was not\n\nAnd so it has a downward push on the housing industry we're seeing a downward push on the production of automobiles and we'll see more the downward push on the production on home appliances and so for this is what happens when\nYou screw around with the economy whether it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or or Jeb Bush or whoever it is thrown any name you want this is what happened\nAnd what's gonna happen in the drug mark and I'm very concerned about you're going to start to see shortages there's going to be less R and D and to new cutting edge in life and proving medicines\nEverything can't be about redistributing well everything can't be a ... and maybe they cannot be about lowering prices at no with no effect\n\nWe don't treat salaries that way we don't treat profits that way\nIt's amazing to me the only entity that gets bigger and bigger and gets more and more money is the federal government and even conservative nationalist populists they always turn to\nThe central federal government to step in and rescue this are rescue that we never learn our lessons\nSo I picked at least for industries now that this administration has interfered in in a
