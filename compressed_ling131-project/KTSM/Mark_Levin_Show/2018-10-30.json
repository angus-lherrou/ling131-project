it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it\nSo the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked about it and so how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't\nChange the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute that here's the current speaker of the house\nPaul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak yeah go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment is pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact same ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation of understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there for more than a happens to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago\nAnd he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west as a you know ... has professor at the University of Texas law school but he's more than them the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment go\nHave after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth

a one one [noise]\nSo in the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies somehow somewhere the bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this [noise]\nMy buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of national views he wants to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really\nIn my humble opinion address the issue codified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens and then\nWe have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr moose and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch taking back the authority to interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nElectron who's changing immigration laws you know I brought\nAs a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he writes over a conservative reviewer and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dad he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd hit the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want in a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent a key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there's nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty it looks like Trump is doing\nA lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that it because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly\nWhat they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia but Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one came all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is that a lot so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nNow that's just one of many ways optimum has resolved over half a billion and tax that for clients half a billion\nCo opt them a tax relief\nAt eight hundred
