rice transparency part is the importance in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have to compete on a service and outcome type of model just like we do with everything else is white you know I I make the analogy to all of their insurance products in our lives if you end up having a you know a a minor\nIssue with your car you go to a mechanic he get it fixed you can shop around you can see what mechanics or reliable which ones you feel good about see what things cost and make that decision if you get into a significant accidents\nYou end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop but your insurance company will go and work with right you're not do as much shopping there so the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nBut don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for the best price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical a bit right uh so that would be in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries complications that you don't even know about it until you get in there are so like you know there are some of these things will never be solved a by being able to say oh okay well this has everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide the level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nAgain I I feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you that can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing\nAnd it's not necessarily a something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to ask you how much is this going to cost\nAnd it can lead to the health care provider\nKind of running in circles and every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare in in some instances because they couldn't tell me how much something was going to cost\nI won't necessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here I'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it\nSo in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at and hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with the least some guidance on that type of information\nBut again that God blessing and best wishes to you and if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh you're you're a information there uh we uh we have it and I can get in touch with you I'm All right so\nSwitch gears here for a moment away from health care over to another major fraud by the way\nAs we are getting into this climate talks are going on who is this guy it's clearly not the gray one no you're right and I'm more like the little one I Am

actually like I'm real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real what a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say they're like a tornado\nOr this you know in hurricanes a lot of people put the focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow ... about almost anything but the went just as you saw with boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with hardy\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes\nRarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the up one or the FBI tornadoes go right\nOn top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour hurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an\nYes three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack ads thing I Am I got my parents and my sister my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being a writer ironically and I'm On the other coast some southeastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us they were out power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach you sold all reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he ... as a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nBut there's something else that is kind of a an important in the ... contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf or take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures of Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but debris and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "13"}
