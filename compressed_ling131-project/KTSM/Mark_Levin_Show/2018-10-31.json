corporate executives on the boards of directors\n\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this they want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statue will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute that goes there will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship some of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or what have been done already they said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why pass a statute if in fact as the laugh says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things\nThat birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna fix statute won't fix it because they're saying\nYou have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me birthright citizenship\nWas not actually implemented in this country in the sixties and seventies then Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabin all was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than they do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted and ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president the plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq\nWhile collectively ignoring endless uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite offer the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F wells and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ethically that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no new principal on quote\nQuote it is not the object of this bill to establish a new rights but they're protecting enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared in Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it how many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it wouldn't be applied to illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not one\n\nThat was passed to protect African American former slaves not foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nThe notion that an amendment designed to grant freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens would be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes it's scandalous\n\nFirst sentence that the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state where they reside we need not\nSubject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at the time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to which complete jurisdiction quote not allowing allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional rafters added a second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nA step back in Nineteen sixty five were the who released their single my

Senate race just going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow the U.S Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidate\nThat will start at the base I'm a conservative fighter bark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama Power Plan that was just this amazing power grab over the United states\nEnergy supply we lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court factor was the last major

have protection for the unborn I'm also strongly\nThe second amendment and our gun rights\nAnd we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president because he is helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy

also that he stood with life on the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you need someone who is pro life who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a plant paranoid on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers mansion\nIs best known for offering a big gun control bill and on the issue of coal\nOh I have to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion\nAnd conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win on election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you it's because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and whites and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYear right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said
