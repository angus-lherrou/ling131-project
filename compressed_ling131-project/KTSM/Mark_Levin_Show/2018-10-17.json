inside the studio by gags check it out now\nThe news radio I'm Brian shrug Saudi leaders say they don't know what happened to missing journalist ... and they want a thorough investigation to find out\nPresident Trump says it would be bad if Saudi leaders knew what happened Trump made the comment at the Fox Business Network today Turkish officials believe the Saudi decided it was killed earlier this month after entering his country's consulate in Istanbul\nNot want all oh by the way small detail I'll get there I I couldn't\nHelp by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it when I ended up writing this was the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swift political endorsement could become the biggest red\nAt the polls as radical ever as the polls [laughter] I mean\nOK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nWay pop star Taylor Swift made ways by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in her home state of Tennessee the effect of sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post\nRight away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media as recently as a couple of days ago are still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey so he was up in Tennessee or\nThe um Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat Bill Bratton sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's average and a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect where is she today and the three most recent bowls and that particular race is now\nNine points so oh\nNot exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on is negative six percent in a week so I like to say you've got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal\nYou got a lot of folks that are ... million or the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction I enter a science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSaid if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little detail Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know him the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling now\nShe spoke of supporting el ... writes\nGB T rights as far from Tennessee values by the way [noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed\nBill Bratton Finn he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the right to hurt as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville that are yeah but here's the thing\nAnybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support\nGay marriage and host of other old G Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\n\nSo she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\n[laughter] I mean and there's a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and law you log\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity and and Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't dissipating I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements worked right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean that did the trick is does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L. J. B. T. writes values\nShe could actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOberlin phrase endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for ... over Hillary Clinton\nSo if only Taylor Swift headway then where's her Pennsylvania algae B. T. Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support\nGay marriage or the L G T rights that made her look like she is as cool as as she actually is that she could have had somebody that you know it was going to I don't know shake it off\nDo whatever it is but she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way it is for tendency values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Britain's and that is not supportive of those things\nEighty one percent of tendency ins are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values off saying\nTwo sides to stories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian ... in for the gray one month\nHim ...\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS they didn't

you I just thought of something and extension to what I Want to talk about what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be\nEven a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with\nSpringsteen and Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that not really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all kind of aggressive music or that in it or we're coming at you but they're the St Louis ... in the same cost especially Springsteen were they were anti war a it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken a serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities ... if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show a problem\nThe university back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message just what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell it the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody is closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen made that kind of thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have Tennessee values\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee oh you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] same they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that's those people and so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kinda cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just hoping that God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my oh\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is that irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know they just are\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you got some work to do in Jersey oh let's go to a liberal then in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota hailing\nOh I tell my liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the Kansas sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nI

B. S. that MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump did decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process so at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian bought a Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey\nIt is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor kicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show the murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nAgainst Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no this is the ah\nThe event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months to Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use\nEvent that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen how is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama\nDelivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis but whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen\nIran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it\nOccurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show geek and stupidly they decided to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are\nThe odds you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana president it's going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that a lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there\nHave been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage MS Thirteen\nWith are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and as Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis was going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen in the house I have no idea\nSo so let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does\nEight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one

deceit\nDrier warmer air moving in and temperatures back on the rise with a little more sunshine however keep in mind that even though our temperatures will be a little warmer for the weekend\nWe are still staying below average enraged chances slum they'll continue throughout the week isolated in nature from the gay Fox fourteen severe where they sent to this is chief meteorologist Sandra Diaz\nSeven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that ah it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine present never get U.S Supreme court\nAnd so if in twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not come from any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will understand that state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate a you could nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental certainly all the investigations if the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's live his wife's life Jared Kushner's live everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare\nAnd the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course is foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with his odds\nThings are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who ally\nOh the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react and Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you've got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who went to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with him on a play you some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens go there just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse had comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so\nThink about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are is incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivized and if you incentivized the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles than

deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo we're friends and how many jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look\nWe want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not ever call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and then he said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nUntil I have a thirty first sign in and help certainly quite nice on the\nFan cancer foundation [noise]\nI repair bills are terrible especially when you're not covered by
