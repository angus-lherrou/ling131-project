President Trump is defending suggestions that the migrant caravan contain some suspected terrorists from the middle east at the White House today Trump said it could very well be he also said he has some very good information but added there's no proof of anything\nWell let me just give me some perspective here this so called national emergency actually really represents about point zero six percent of all the undocumented people already in this country is that we're talking about a very small fraction of people here but the president is hoping that this is a winning strategy at the same time this\nWas a news reporter this is the White House correspondent the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House help Republicans an edge in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid\nThat the president is able to cause you to be fearful and scared\nSo stupid you can't process what's actually taking place and besides it's only zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country the irony is that there's so many illegal aliens in this country seven thousand or whatever the numbers marching tourists\nOther border to this reporter simply no big deal\nPeter Alexander another White House\nCorrespondent this time

achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message of free\nAnd I'll just fear stop this was another journalist\nSo instead of talking about the economy which of course the media never talk about\nInstead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and order remind you of course it is law and order but it's fear UC go ahead\nArgument focuses on stoking fears of illegal immigration MS Thirteen shadowy Middle Eastern\nSide just wait a minute I happen to live in a

you see ladies and gentlemen unless you are absolutely emotionally out of your mind you're not going to vote\nYou're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is not an important issue it may not be an important issue to phony journalists to phony anchors the phony host a phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\n\nIt is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters but people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it matters to people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\n\nGo ahead Democrats from winning back the house or the Senate or both obviously what's crucial in this circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up against the wall right here this is a reporter\n\nNow Gloria borders on CNN Today utterly and completely predictable\n\nBut we need to hear from Gloria border because she's on CNN all the time cut for go\nYou know I'm old enough to remember twenty sixteen [laughter] this is this is funny they

you look at this look at the race made it look what's going on race baiting\nThousands of people who've told us what they plan to do marching to our border there from Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and other countries it's about race baiting their identify\n\nBaiting is what we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings by the left the Democrats and the media go ahead\nAnd Republicans are feeling good because if you start with Kavanaugh and then you you know something switched after Kavanaugh and\nThe president is now on the campaign trail rally in ... and getting them out to vote and you see in the poll numbers that suddenly Republican voters are monsters energizes Democrats not quite but almost has energized has Democrats wearables as before this before this fear mongering before before\nThis fear mongering Kavanaugh how are we fear in my arm and how's the president's fear mongering now\nHe's plain spoken just like Harry Truman he's explaining what's taking place\n\nThere's an invasion taking place seven thousand people who wish to come across the border illegally what the hell do you call it a parade\nGo ahead I they were like okay I'm going to sit at home and what Trump
