market with their small and relatively inexpensive ... crown sedans it took until the mid sixties for the company to gain a respectable chunk of the American markets and in Nineteen Seventy five Toyota became the best selling import brand in the United states\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety a hundred and thirty two feet below the English Channel workers drill and opening the size of a car through wall of rock\nThis was no ordinary hold that connected the two ends of an underwater tunnel Lincoln Great Britain with the European mainland for the first time in more than a thousand years

number one TV stream\nThat says we stop TV streams are radio\nWaves the silver surfer happy Halloween from her radio\nAnd turn on your cell phone\n[noise] [noise] read\n\nBeen together a long time those of you who've listen to this program a long time relatively long time right [noise] more than Fifteen Years now others have been with you\nLonger that's okay I had a at other careers I never even tended to get into this career but we've had a very special relationship I feel\n\nI Know for many of you and part of your family in some respects distant part of your family but the same with me I Know I'm blessed with you\n\nAnd the common thread in all this is our love of country\n\nThat's where you were taught that is what you believe that's what I was taught that's what I Believe there's some people in this country who don't love it who attack who rip it apart who choose their fellow citizens are being like Hitler and Nazis and racist and so forth\nThese are the forces these are the people we must defeat\nNo we can't right now to feed them in our public schools and college campuses we can't night right now defeat them in Hollywood in Beverly Hills in the entertainment industry we can't right now defeat them in the media the ladies in general we can defeat them at the ballot box\nIt's up to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way to get out and vote think of what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty to take care of business here\nI really believe that\nIf you're a patriotic duty this is not just another election if we lose their grave consequences\n\nAnd so rather than have anxiety and frustration\nPut your energy to work\nPut your energy into it you don't need people to tell you what to do you know what to do you know how to get other people involved in voting and so forth as your own precinct worker get out the vote I brought a number of candidates to you they're still up on my Facebook and Twitter sites who need your help in close races\nA number of Kennedy\nAs I told you I don't believe in giving to the party bureaucracy I Believe in giving the candidates [noise] so\nI Would encourage you to look at them and support them and hopefully most of them will win on Tuesday but some of them won't\nBut the goal is to make sure most of them don't lose but most of them do it and I can't get down into every house fight but we have like forty seats\nThat are close you may live in one of those districts one of those seven districts in California one of those six\nOr seven districts in Pennsylvania one of those three districts in New Jersey one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're all over the country\nMay live in one of those districts\nVery very important\nThat you get involved\nEven in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would\nIs their assignment majority and if they\nWere about to find out are the poles right are are the polls wrong we're about to find out but we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser\nYou\nKnow you love this country and you know there are candidates out there who do not\nTheir candidates out there who want to fundamentally change America I don't want to fundamentally change America I Love America\n\nYou know Hollywood Bloomberg\nSty or Soros and others many others multi millionaires\nYou know that they they support a strongly centralized government because they know is multi millionaires they have enormous influence the future this society and they want more influence over the ... the future of this aside their ego maniacal their narcissistic\nWith the fight this\nYou shouldn't be on the fence right now my fellow conservatives in Arizona you shouldn't be on the fence\n\nMy fellow conservatives in the ... district of Virginia were Barbara Comstock as you should be on the fence anymore\n\nI fellow conservatives in the state of Nevada you shouldn't be on the fence anymore\n\nAnd we can go through all the states where the Republicans running or not necessarily that conservative but\nThey still love the country they're not trying to tear it apart and it seems and that's the kind of race we have right now folks\nI Know you detest the media and you have every reason to test the media\n\nThere not defending the first amendment there not defending freedom and the press we've talked about this before they're advancing a a radical ideological agenda there they're trying to disrupt this presidency they're trying to burden this presidency they're trying to undermine this presidency\nMuch like Russian TV they're like ... to like prompt you get very little news from news today right\n\nSo this election is very important and I look It's Wednesday I'm going to keep talking about this right up to election day on Tuesday night when I sit here and hopefully with millions of you\nAnd the return start coming in as we have every election cycle and we start analyzing what's going on a very good about this when these returns started to come in Mr produced so ... and the
