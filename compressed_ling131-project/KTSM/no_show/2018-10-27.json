{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "For the next decade because of course wants to do with the current projects then they start working on I tend itself which is going to be a different nightmare we've not known\nYeah and also a Montana is going to mean sort of a highway of its own with access roads and all of that\nSo so yeah we've got though those access issues going on a one slightly more now settled issue was the idea of of a crook trans border travel specifically trade now with the NAFTA to point out the ah the U.S Mexico or Canada agreement us MCA\nAs I think it's being called now NAFTA was so much easier to say it was a nice acronym that we all understood and there's ... it doesn't work so that so that that was up in the yard of serious concern there for a bit and while the terms are\nStrictly fully understood this new agreement yet at least it's it's something in writing that can be analyzed\nThe sense I get talking to 'em border manufacturers and companies are on the border is that it's not sort of jubilation over this this new agreement it's more a sigh of relief\nOr that the uh the uncertainty that these really tough negotiations that really costs of bitterness or between our trade partners particularly Canada but also in Mexico or can be put behind us and that they are moving forward and making business business decisions\nTo grow I mean yeah you can't you can't make decisions if you don't know what's gonna happen and so that that uncertainty was certainly you could probably cost a lot of heart heartburn throughout our region um but now that again that's at least some things in writing even though it still has to go through congressional approval\nAll of that and there could technically be other other hiccups that come along the way it looks like it's in writing it's there's there's a level of expectation at this point of what will happen often or general general ideas\nYeah and and you know we have not really heard even locally uh much about what the contents of this are the terms of the way it might affect things in my general impression is that it's not going to have a great effect on things and I think for a lot of people of me included that that's a great sense of relief\nThat this has not turned into frankly a Trump disaster and we're we're basically calling for\nYou know the wall and uh I as a cessation of trade\nAnd that and that sort of cooler heads of kind of prevailed on this um you know we still wait the next door in a big deal here uh you know and it may be this issue of the wall coming through and and uh and completion of a of a more imposing a barrier between the U.S and Mexico\nAre and and all that's going to raise frankly environmentally and you know you have to think of the farmers Mexican law down the valley\nA losing property and it's going to be something else if that actually goes\nThe eminent note the eminent domain the logistical concepts there's a whole lot going on there but and and that's been\nThat that's been talked about a lot even outside of our region on I mean the whole you know multi thousand mile coverage of the border I mean like how do you put a Walter Big Bend\nLike that doesn't make that would want to think about that yeah that's that's I mean having been in that area I've been down the rivers where you you know you're in a star canyon and technically like the the middle of the river technically you couldn't you know be throwing rocks at Mexico but you're I mean it's a it's a stark\nStart candy and like your it's sheer walls on either side with the river going down the middle and it's like you can't you don't there's no real way to build a wall\nRight there so of course other logistical concerns that will be weird going on there but when it comes but going back to the ... the ... was it was off the MCAA because the U.S MCAA Mexico Canada agreement I'm gonna call I'm going to use that as my short term MCA is\nYou're basically my understanding is that it's benchmarks have moved things have been shifted as opposed to revamping and ... significant ... and reinventing the wheel basically it's out now we'll spinning rims basically\nThe difference here it looks like it's more tweak sort of around round the edges to make adjustments but anybody here in El Paso who every day has to cross the international bridge back and forth from Mexico to El Paso and and\nSee that you know this new agreement whatever the wall serious challenges really still remain here and the focus really needs to be on those ports of entry I mean there's no clogged the wait times are so long\nAnd there's a I think a little focus on improving the mobility of both trade I mean there's just billions of dollars in trade that goes through hell yeah as well as as people it's hard to understand if you haven't made that trip\nBut yeah and I've I've long been impressed with\nThe the facility like him there have been investment in our region not necessarily El Paso in general but I've been long impressed with with Santa today is uh and\nThe specific focus work they've had out there towards developing those capabilities to make sure that the I mean what will the overweight ... area the specific and dedicated [noise] you know cargo livestock and other transit lanes but they have out there because that's\nThat's likely what should be happening and we've had some comment from local political candidates about how well trade made is\nOkay but if that stuff that's happening here so if it's going through here and uh I Wonder how much how about ... pervasive of an idea that isn't that people maybe not getting the impact that it\nCan aggregate it really ... in terms of the amount of things that are coming through um\nLike that and honestly that even apply for a pro at another ring or you're just going away or you know into the to the whole drug trade\n... oh yeah just being a significant significant Cora or for for you know for drugs and and now we have this re emerging war you know down and down and watch us and Mexico over over control of a quarter ... sectors and everything else and and fortunately\nEven though things and really really bad over there now or if you have we haven't gotten that the sort of the spillover effect\nOf that we were really worried about last time we got a lot of news El Paso the the the difference between asking why does really getting blurred and people were saying how can you even live in El Paso violent when in fact the ball harrowing auto off in the streets of all Paso comments a mess that friends do that and that hasn't happened at this time it was never have there is\nAnd and so now we have new administration of lettuce and in hopes are that they'll actually be able to get their arms around or or or [laughter] or at least a foot upon some of this or that that the violence that has taken place I'd I don't see a lot of possibility of acts just doesn't seem Mexico was capable\nOf dealing with those issues and we can all day long but the fact is that all of those drugs are headed here\nI mean the other end where where the ... there was a lawyer\nYeah market and we really can't blame them for the fact that we have our market has created havoc on on that side of the border um and so yeah we went in this new administration and see if they can actually pull things together um [noise]\nYeah I I heard an interesting theory the other day about about why we have so much a just a little crime here\nYou know and that is that um that that with all of the drugs that are coming across the last thing that that the cartels want\nIs to see um I did any any significant violence in the El Paso yes side any any any law officers\nOr killed or anything like that that can really put slam the door on this thing when in fact this is this is said to be any way the primary quarter of drugs and so that's where everything is nice and quiet you know on the passenger side I mean to to borrow disrupt that fact and what\nYou tend to ah to say correctly on the radio a phrase that that would apply you don't ... where you consume basically because the the concept here that they're not interested in fouling up their market the where things go and\nAnd I mean the few significant times that has popped up in the news was during some of the um\nThere was the the boxing match held in the sun bowl where there were concerns about you know we're going to be having cartel big wigs show up there and it got even reported that there was a an unofficial troops declared so that they could all you know attend and have a good time there and again not foul up this side of the border for themselves I think\nThat's what we have here is a truce on this side of the border as a matter of fact and you know if you think about it and we always hear that that a lot of the top of the leaders you know in fact live over here they they live over here and the kids go to school over here and they go over there and fight\nI mean yeah if it's if even and\nThe truth or or what works I mean the problem\nAnd the the real reason that I think that the Mexican regime or any regime is going to have issues is that\nWhat you see the problems when there are the conflicts between cartels I mean that was going on you know it was during the real the real heights of the violence is it wasn't that a cartel was in control is that there was no cartel in control and there was a battle going over it\nOnce one car tells you control things quiet down or they perfect certainly not cause then they're just doing whatever they want but then they're doing it may\nMore surgical more beneficial ways to them it's when there's the cartel violence going up the conflict between the hotels\nThat you see a which is without leaving bodies hung from a I mean yeah the little ...\nNot just our towns but uh you have the gangs that are ... each each of cartel a as well\nSo I mean yeah but again it's it's it's it's it's once you realize that it's not that there's a lack of cartel is that there's a lack of competition in the cartel is what leads to the piece in areas like waters and other parts of might not have to\nBe what's going on right now nomination between the cartels and what starts to raise concerns is windows gangs started getting desperate for funds and art I'm getting desperate for recruiting that's when you start seeing kidnappings that's when you start seeing the protection money\nAnd ah that's when maybe a search attracting more attention\nSo far there has been some of that but not as much as there was a back and and twenty eleven so there's no need to be done [noise]\nNBC News radio coverage or Jordan right now Pittsburgh Police said there are multiple casualties with at least eight people killed after a gunman opened fire this morning near a synagogue\nA suspect is in custody police say he surrendered beliefs and the SWAT Team are surrounding the tree of life synagogue in squirrel hill and asking residents to avoid that area commander Jason window we're\nWith finding appear on the radio yeah he'll be back with this guy here who knows stuff and he has all kinds of what he was going to be second hour anyway so I asked him would you please come early I asked him please come in early and talk a whole lot more about stuff yeah and his name is Jeff Romney born adjust\nGood morning welcome here thank you glad to be back\nAnd you're the director of the museum of archaeology for the city of El Paso yeah we'd ask you to come in second hour to explain\nHey you just got renovated somehow what's that all about right and then we saw in blood Amir couldn't make it I said what the heck\nBut you have a personal background and some of the ancient places around the southwest you liked that stuff I Love that stuff oh goodness\nYou know you sort of grew up in one in in your costs as grind day that's correct and you looked at down a whole lot in your in your youth in your ... you know he's not a huge was that was a while back that you have ... I was born in Utah but I'm not ... okay but the\nThing is though you have looked at some of the ancient history says so that's something else we're going to take a look at it because they're fascinating when you realize we're driving around in our cars on places where they used to have ... Tomahawk and all that kind of thing that's right or history goes way back it really does ... go ahead\nWell if it's unusual to have somebody is the director of an archeology museum in a specific area that actually knows the history and was raised in an area of that history and as the love like he does he really puts his heart into the museum which is fantastic\nAnd the old fashioned museum of archaeology is kind of an unusual animal all by itself is it not how many of those around\nYou know specifically dedicated to southwest start though it sure there's not a whole lot and we're up and only one of the only ones right here in this region oh yeah we have we have we have um the brand new and cultural center in last Christmas which dedicate some of their exit exhibits to archeology and southwest culture and\nThen we've got you know of course the museums up in silver city\nUm university up there and we also have the ... foundation a little bit further west and Arizona that has a wonderful facility there regulation\nBut ancient history is we're all over the place and when it comes time to figure out what they were what happened to them and what they turned into you know it's an amazing history tell us about the museum itself now it's been out of service since uh September sometime\nWill be closed or we close temporarily for the construction of improvements funded by quality of life or bombs that were passed by voters in two thousand and four of them we closed on November ninth sorry September night\nAnd we will be closed all the way up until November seventeenth will reopen the or doors to count on November seventeenth a nine o'clock so we are still under construction I can report that things are going very well\nAnd the ... the the upgrades are primarily dealing with eighty eight compliance where and improving our compliance and also I decided to expand our collection storage area\nI didn't need the big office space that I was in at the time and so I moved myself to a small place in the back which is just fine and opened up a big space now for how good a good idea for a collections\nBut now you you didn't they didn't do anything on the outside to the ... uh except area out there did they didn't see that or you know mostly on the inside\nYeah the only thing that we've we've been doing are are the following we put an emergency door in the north gallery\nWe put another emergency exit door and the south calorie that's where the guy around us are there's probably just compliance issues there yeah we need to have some more exits um we did tear up the whole way that leads to the restroom is from the foyer and expanded that by quite a bit\nFor ADA compliance we've completely re done both restrooms and we\nDid some upgrades and the break room including the sink and the cabinets to make them ADA compliant okay now in your dire around that area you\nTook the baby mammoth and now it's a full grown man [laughter] you know letting fit in the room no it wouldn't sit there with it\nThat Iran has have not been touched they're they're still as they were\nBut that baby mammoth mammoth this humongous and that is a baby mammoth ... represents a baby that if you had a real life size full grown ... their head would go out the air conditioner right\nWe have a skylights [laughter] I mean there's no way you could fill ... can you imagine one of those in there it'd be nice to get good now what if you had a boy scout project who they know they would never build a mammoth for you\nI don't think we could fit it in there what do you have five ... go make that want to go out so that's something for the future when you grow even bigger wouldn't it be cool to have a real life size a replica of a mammoth that mean that I think it's bigger than a a van\n... is is that supposed to represent the or not the ... area where the the mammoth his\nWell our ... our our south gallery or the diagram a gallery it gives a very brief discussion of the major\nPeriods throughout the southwest\nHistory pre history so way back is the man we start way back in the beginning as a war and we work our way up to the present there and so there's a brief discussion on each of those menstrual periods which are not only applicable to the El Paso resume but there are a ... to the greater southwest as a whole\nNo ma'am is we're in El Paso at one point you know walking around absolute dinosaurs were here at one point walking around actually yeah much further back yeah no they were there we had mega fauna here in the past so area mega fauna meaning the big animals and we had ... we had mastered the\nMega fauna I was waiting to die and that is Laura I got another phone offered\nOh we had ... we had camels we had giants loss we had dire walls there'll be horses too little bitty horses we had saber tooth cats are lying on a circus you had there yeah there was a lot of really funding to Stanford circa\nBut the thing is a museum of archaeology you know pass it was an incredibly unique event just to have it there it started out as the wilderness park museum right back in the day when somebody I guess it was a mayor carved out acres\nTurned it into a park and forty one years ago this month and which may or do you remember\nI Can't remember I think I think it was a a it was before west fall but it was for VW Harvey because he paid the money to put the building and out of his own pocket yes it was mayor Herbie and mayor Herbie did that so they cleared Seventeen make as much as I cleared\nYou're talking in the middle of the firing range from the U.S army yep cashmere range plug that museum right down in what they fired bullets wants to in fact that that area was the Vietnam exhibit\nAt one point where they had pop up\nA little love Vietnamese towns up in the hills and right where the archaeology museum was was a control center so they had people out there shooting up and and that's what was there\nWell and it's it's still of a concern to some degree you know the unexploded ordinance is out there yeah not not directly around them use them but further afield um we do have signs out there as most people have same whereas says please don't walk beyond these signs because of that danger in fact the army's going to be putting up a fence\nAround the perimeter of the property down around them use them just to encourage people not to go past that point\nYeah I think people out there that you don't want to go out with them but that's\nThe history of that spot yes if I was a fiery and so then they also cleared the space to put the road to trans mountain road in the fifties correct and so that is where you are the museum of archaeology and your largest exhibit is right out your back door\nIt's the wilderness park of north mount Franklin South in South Africa and is there and that that's the only exhibited changes every every season\nYou know and I recently moved to the northeast and I can say that I think we have the prettiest views of the mountains in town there right there around the museum it's gorgeous it is if you haven't had the opportunity or taking the time to stop come out in the U.S once we reopened in November and inexperienced and it's really a beautiful view\nYeah we've been we've been telling people that even though it's closed go ahead and go on out there at least you know if that's gay area still open\nWe are on during the archery thing right\nWe are doing the archery on Saturdays um today in fact and then on November third will be doing it again and then we'll be reopened them back on our rights\nWhen I get a bunch of people out there shooting arrows\nOh thousands of people every year really yeah and and then the Adel Adel\nOn occasionally bring out the idle idle and let kids learn how to use that even more ancient weapon and uh yeah it's a great time for all ages we provide all the materials and it's free\nSo the archaeology museum is about to reopen mid November it's gonna turn into kind of like what it was for archeology but a much better facility for functioning as eighty eight complained that as a facility that's correct yeah okay and so then the giant mastodon project is something we just started [laughter] and I'm not sure how soon that's going to happen but\nI can see I can see like you know like a like a a botanical garden type thing we had it open and the really nice well you could have a big guy out there and they win the lottery we can ... we had help only the lottery\nThey in a fun so many things right now almost one did everything last what was the Tuesday but that didn't quite work well somebody I online or dollars you you you want\nReally unique experience in our nation and I would hope to see in future years people coming from all around but it was absolutely just unbelievably [noise]\nThat I Know it's fun to listen to somebody stand there and tell you why they died and what happened to them and what and if they act like it to them\n[noise] oh yeah and the information that research and um it was unbelievable\nAnd also you had the incredible six guns and shady lady crowd doing the reenactment so you could not\nSo funny [laughter] it's a\nGood ... good driving and you know the thing is the only trouble with it there's\nSo many things that people schedule on like the third weekend of October that it always gets kind of ... good interpreter fare out at a Waco tanks you all kinds of other things going on but I'm Glad you made it down and I got down there as well that that's where these things are there is number one on your mind you I mean what else is on your mind\nAs much I Want everyone to write into Texas Monthly their new there November issue is all about Thanksgiving and the food and they talked about the first Thanksgiving not El Paso\nWhere a climate dry\nOh that one that one you know all that\nThat they don't really know what they're talking about do they\nOh I'm going to write in and I'm going to encourage them to do an article on the first Thanksgiving\nFor you know you want to do you want to have anything to do with a trivia or you just want to hang up\nAnd I'll take a shot I probably won't get it I'll take a shot\nOK which which question or to give her one of them the whatever what exhibit do that one\nDid you learn tried the first question that what what permanent exhibited they archeology museum changes with the seasons\nFor the next one oh let's do the next [laughter]\nWhat was the name of the ancient people of El Paso\nAnd it wasn't all old will pass and one's doesn't work\nI Know I'm going to have to play up once on that and thank you and I have to think\nI was talking to Melissa I said oh such and such and I said oh and she goes oh my gosh\n[laughter] I met her she is a really nice lady she but she wouldn't drag to friends that were there to the vet\nActual person said my God [laughter] well\nI just want to thank you again wonderful experience everyone seems to go next year it's it's wonderful\nJamie can I get you to hold and and can we put her on hold because I'd like to get her phone number can I Wish I had an old\nAnd don't forget you here comes an announcement about next Saturday at the uh the ... American yes you are aware Jimmy that that's coming up now\nI did because for two reasons one I heard it on your program to when I went to the actual history the information or received on to walk to history had in there about the little white those next week\nYeah I'd like to get your phone number so hold on a on the line and and give that to a joint Shelley for me please\nOkay running a are you\nWhere are you going to get back to a ... in fact I'm going to ask Jeff ...\nThe question that I think he knows and you know for a trivia necessarily but we have to museums that deal with history both sponsored by the city of El Paso the history museum and the archaeology museum how do you differentiate what information goes in which museum I think you can handle this one\nPut him back on your way or what happened to Jeff\nLurie as well and in general the pessimism of archaeology deals with the pre history of the region although we also talked about\nHistoric people's defined pre history um before the Spanish the rival of European that's the point people need to know that you got the Europeans and all their stuff in the downtown museum history forward\nRight and everything before that is out in northeast El Paso at the museum for the most part that is true yeah okay and so that's that's the other unique thing about having a museum of archaeology is it you have to find a point\nWhere you decide what goes in which museum which goes here because archeology to me is a fascinating background who we are today\nWe'll talk more about that in a minute picking one more break your call us if you need to uh the outstanding trivia question who leave him out or whatever yeah but if we find that most people would rather just sitting here listening what we're oh I Know scribe with a guess so ah but the number and then there's a book\nThat's why ...

TV to ah\nSunday dizzy Phillies is most famous character in this special Mickey's Ninety six calculated appearances in performance is like fifty thousand Tony Hayward Sarah highlights Josh Groban Meghan Trainor exact brown Dan had more party with the house or the mouse Sunday at age seven central on ABC\nAlso on Sunday ... time travel drama lander kicks off its fourth season at a set of central stars\nThat's your TV ... on my heart radio\nHere again Melissa Sargent and Jackson\nHole I we need to pick a Pepe special am Ramy ... something big one of these uh these items out here and the ... area or weeks in a row I think that's so good is the special ... and that means is six bucks\nNo matter what you think you're going to pay at least six bucks though they're like Jeff we've got a couple of minutes left in this hour and we've got your next hours are going to keep going here but if you don't mind explains some of the history that you've been describing the each time frame overlay how does that relate to Keystone site on the west side on Donovan Dr\nWell Keystone um is a very interesting site a for a number of reasons the Keystone site as part of what I just described as the archaic period\nAnd this is\nA site that has some of the oldest human made structures and the southwest that we have found so far the oldest\nSome of the older structures I'm In the southwest dating back about four thousand five hundred years ago so this was a period of time where people\nAre experimenting with different types of buildings um these would have been above ground structures per se but we're patched over with like a dome covering of plant material\nSo they put a couple of big branches in the ground and meet at the top and the cover those with other branches in mud\nAnd in some cases mud yes and so there was about twenty over those structures there so it's it's pretty impressive for its time and so those are contemporary structures\nIs the point yeah they weren't now in Twenty years later another when they were all at the same time that's a village\nWell like if it's entirely plausible that they would have been built over a defined period of time whether it's Twenty years or Thirty years or what have you um or they could have been built at the same time on is the group of people correct yeah\nA larger and then the other thing they did they put themselves right on a draw it came down from the Franklin so they would be theoretically water coming by but they were also at the wetlands but you're still there today correct and so they had a place to hang up\nThis is a time period where people are still very much heavily dependent in this region anyway on hunting and gathering wild food's one wild wild animals and they were probably also experimenting with agriculture at that time as well but\nIt's a very interesting side and we're we're lucky to have it it's owned by the city of El Paso and the archaeological conservancy is my understanding so it's definitely a treasure here in town and it's definitely worth preserving yeah alcohol Keystone heritage park\nAnd yeah it's it's owned by the city but Keith on ... uh\nThe Keystone Harris ... keeps on heritage got what is it kicked on heritage I don't think he's now they're just so the Asian\nThey mail yeah still manage it and re release it yeah from the the city they raised the funds for it it's like Ninety Ninety or is it fifty acres what it in that fifty\nTwo acres a and that area's pretty much left open most of it and we've done the ... experience out there we left that natural as to what it would have looked like and we've got a lot of plans we eventually when they have an interpreter center there will be combined building for renting out for special occasions but I ... I Know\nI Know we're working with some organization statue where we think we got it to where we will have a building soon\nUh to where we will have an interpreter center there so we can finally get it there to where we can have people seeing learn more about actually what was going on there a Keystone\nA but it's also kind of a combined unique setting and the fact that we're also on the camino real so you have a combined mixture of history he we could also interpret that history to suit will be combined you'll see the actual history of the\nThe ... in combination with the history of Keystone in the ... the architect people that were there so Bernie's getting measured for a ... helmet [laughter] yeah [laughter]\n... cowboy hat off yeah I like to see that when they were doing the the ah the cat ... for the\nA pot of um you know making sense yet I Know I'll get that went straight yeah so we come back when you do in the meantime Jeff we got to get outta here for this hour is going to be another hour lister let's talk about Keystone a ... a little further but on the other hand key so how does it rate just real quick in in the old sites is a biggie isn't it\nIt it is big for that time period yeah so I'm One of the things that makes a remarkable and I mean twenty twenty um\nBuildings if you are or or or a Shiite houses whatever they were whatever yeah this is a little bit before the ... house period but yet all the other structures ... it's similar to overlook yep exactly does that mean\nWell again a ... a house comes later in the period and we'll talk about that may be in the future a part of this discussion but the wiki ups basically are above ground structures for the most part and they just are such sober with a dome shaped\nA\nBunch of a wood and other materials will sometimes plastered with over the top of it so I guess a an igloo to some degree of other shape isn't quite\nRight to compare it when you do your eyes and you don't use I saw just like All right my clock says we're out of here is er here what is your clock say [noise]\n... that just came down to drill merit how\nDo you are you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on anti avenue and candy to open ... Saturdays and Sundays every morning\nRemember reading that check out their trail haunted house race\nYeah their wares\nVery very bad for you or do you see a Montana there were offering required many great minerals are both vehicles and how little they need to be over ... versus public if you can also at least returns repercussions and little return that's a funny for a long time\nI marked down at my house has ever vows even wild over ten hours in on the Internet for free all vehicles over\nFor less than your voice was over there you go\nOh Paso help on a dot com prison so world's worst boss but one of those jobs on huge there's no jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a\nAnd that's pretty common in archeology all over the world actually um sites are rarely excavated in for any more I mean a lot of cases\nThey've even moved away from excavating at all because of modern technology like what well you know you have you have so now you have you have radar rather than us on our ... radar penetrating devices where you can actually see what's on the surface and\nIt takes a lot of training to interpret the ... but in time people can tell whether they're structures or whether there's features on things of that nature and so because so much archaeology has already been done in the southwest and the timelines for the most part are pretty well set\nAnd the cultures are pretty well defined there's no real need to excavate a lot of fights anymore in that regard\nSo we're moving more into a period of preservation\nAnd keeping sites as they are in part because like I mentioned there's no need to dig them all up in their entirety anymore and also we like to preserve as much as we can for future generations and scholars who may have different techniques and more than\n... toys to work with and the Keystone that's exactly the case you will not find any remnants of those old villages on the surface out there so don't go looking it's all underground\nBecause if you look at it this way archaeology in many ways\nThere's a one shot deal once you dig it out it's gone it's gone yeah and so you can cover up the building again in ... unprotected by covering it back up but the data was extracted is\nIs no longer in the sequence that it was and it has to be documented that's my writing in journalism papers is so so key and important that people actually write down their research on ...\nYou can tell replica to show what was there which is much better than going in and taking\nIts move on to Waco tax what are you know about ancient people at Waco things they've got writings on the wall out there that they claim archaic\nWell that's that's that's uh that's true um\nBefore the break we were just ending with our discussion of the archaic period and right after the architect period around eighty two hundred we go into a formative or transitional period that goes to about eighty nine hundred now there is a pit house site\nAnd there's other sites that Waco tanks that date to this this time period to so a lot of a lot of the art\nAt Waco tanks are painted or paintings and we attribute most of those paintings to the Pueblo in period which here in the El Paso area is around eighty twelve hundred to fourteen fifty\nI'm so much of the rock art the painted artwork at Waco tank dates to eighty around eleven hundred twelve hundred and so on and so forth and then later historic people's\nCame in and painted their marks as well like the Apache the command she the Iowa he was\nThe topic was and and other groups it's possible that some of that art work out there is is from the Arctic as well\nYou know older so why you know there's always discussion as to why things were painted ... what do you think the initial reasoning for painting was on the rock\nWell the the term Waco tanks I'm ... kind of like a hollow area and ... and then tanks is kind of the same descriptive term given by\nAmerican people so Waco tanks so basically it's a natural natural area where water collects and natural tanks if you will um there is water they're pretty much all year when it rains in fact I've learnt living in the northeast now that\nYou just look to the east and it almost always was raining it Waco tanks during the monsoon season yet another right it's just always predictably there for whatever reason and so because of the water there people would gather and they would camp there because it was a reliable source so\nIt it it's a sacred place to native peoples that's a place where\nI guess you could say worship happened ceremonies\nAnd some of these paintings are probably manifestations of that [noise] and ... is an interesting study and then I've itself\nYou know some of what you see all over the southwest could be just doodling as it were ... people just making their mark yeah\nA lot of it is religious\nSome of it is to document historical things that took place battles and things of that nature and some of it is astronomical you know the study of astronomy and the seasons and the solstice is on the equinox isn't so\nThere's so much there and we don't understand all of\nIt well I always say also it's like a new awareness to ... to develop in studying the link techniques and in the interpretation\nMhm well move move up the Rio Grande a little bit maybe huh you want to talk about a chuckle yeah so basically they are they in Mesa Verde Mesa Verde is now and they said there is a bizarre place is pretty high up in an ... altitude I mean say five hundred feet in some places yeah let's\nOr as we move up the Rio Grande we're moving into a different period of time now don't misunderstand what I'm saying the the the um paleo Indian and the architect period peoples were up there as well\nBut now we move into what is known as the Pueblo in period and southwest archaeology of starts around the year eighty eight hundred eighty seven hundred which was what about Thirteen hundred years ago\nThis is a time period where people\nAre living in pet houses and they're transitioning over time from pet houses into above ground multi room surface structures that are made either of stone masonry or adobe or a mixture of both\nAnd these are the sites that are more popular in common today because they leave the biggest visible the archeological record\nAnd some of them are famous sites during this time period\nIs chocolate canyon which is one of the older\nThings now this is further west of the Rio Grande but it's important to talk about it because this is where the origins as it were of the ancestral Pueblo people or what was formerly known as the on the side of the people lived\nAnd the chocolate cannon phenomenon starts around at least the problem period starts around eighty eight sixty and this is the time of great change in that area of the southwest\nUm we don't understand all of the dynamics is the subject of great debate but what I can tell you just briefly is this is a time when at least in the charcoal area of North West in Mexico and the sun ... basin\nWhere people are actually starting to build great big structures and on his great houses\nAnd there's a lot of debate right now what great houses me\nThere's very little evidence that the entire great and when I said great houses were talking about a room block that has up to two hundred rooms yeah th they can be multilevel multi stories anywhere from one to three some people even ... you know four stories high\nIt's hard to know because in the case of ... for the most part I Love what you see that's left there that's visible for only the one to the two stories because it's collapsed and many places\nBut anyway there's very little evidence that all of these rooms are actually is for people to live in and we say that because\nWe know people use rooms for basic domestic living purposes when they have a fireplace thing or they have a mailing been where they ground corner things of that nature a lot of those features are not present at least on the ground levels of many of the great houses in shock or\nIt could be that those living quarters round the second level which are now gone for the most part so we don't know yeah but anyway not to get too complicated but the current debate is what was taco Kenya\nIt's definitely unique in the southwest it's very clear that people were coming in by the thousands at different times of the year most likely for religious ceremonies thousands thousands of people or weren't living in chocolate fulltime we think that at its peak maybe two to three thousand people lived in Chicago\nIsn't chuckle a location that has a connection like directly like the cost us ground is just some sort of road was cut what is that all the time you hear that discussion well I'll I'll get\nTo that and just a minute if I I'm sure yeah that's what we're gonna run out of time at some point here is that something All right just real quickly just real quick that the chocolate phenomenon\nWhich would look at it like like America and and the Muslim world today that's kind of an ... an allergy I like to see it as yeah you've got people coming in for religious ceremonies possibly political\nNuances what have you can you imagine the ancient world yeah and this is it just becomes a city okay and this last for several hundreds of years now during this time period to get to your question\nJackson um we know that\nThere was contact with people in muscle America how much time how much contact is a subject of great debate even today but we do know that things like my cause a copper bells shelter for his turquoise\nAnd we now know that even chocolate was coming up to talk on trade it from the south to chocolate came up now chocolate just to use\nThree uh and it's it's great that you should try to attend an honor these wonderful people\nInteresting stuff going on here we're about to do trivia are you ready for trivia\nA yes okay we have temporary like us we had to be a question here we have on the air here Ethan got you on the air ...\nHello how are you doing surviving nicely sir how about yourself [noise]\nFine I
