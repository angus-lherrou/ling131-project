{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "Looks like it's more tweaks sort of around round the edges to make adjustments but anybody here in El Paso who every day has to cross the international bridge back and forth from Mexico to El Paso at and and\nSee that you know this new agreement whatever the wall serious challenges really still remain here and the focus really needs to be on those ports of entry I mean there's no clogged the wait times are so long\nAnd there's a ... I think a little focus on improving the mobility of both trade I mean there's just billions of dollars of trade that goes through ... as well as as people and it's hard to understand if you haven't made that trip\nBut yeah and I've I've long been impressed with\nThe the facility like him there have been investment in our region not necessarily El Paso in general but I've been long impressed with with Santa today is uh and the specific focus work they've had out there towards developing those capabilities to make sure that the I mean what will the overweight ... area the specific and dedicated [noise]\nYou know cargo a livestock and other transit lanes but they have out there because that's\nThat's likely what should be happening and we've had some comment from local political candidates about how we'll trade made it is okay but it's not stuff that's happening here so if it's going through here and ah I Wonder how much how about ... per base of of an idea that is that people maybe not getting the impact that it\nCan I get it really I don't see the amount of things that are coming through um\nLike ... and honestly that even apply for a throw it into the ring or you're just going away or you know into the to the whole drug trade ... oh yeah this being a significant significant correlate her for for you know for drugs and and now we have this\nRe emerging war you know down and down and watch us and Mexico over over control of the corners sectors and everything else and and fortunately even though things have really really bad\nOver there now or if you have we haven't gotten that the sort of a spillover effect\nOf that we were really worried about last time we got a lot of news in El Paso the the the difference between asking why does was really getting blurred and people were saying how can you even live in El Paso violent when in fact the ball and harrowing auto off in the streets of all Paso comments a mess that fun stuff and that hasn't happened or this titles never have there is\nAnd and so now we have new administration of lettuce and in hopes are that they'll actually be able to get their arms around or or or [laughter] or at least a foot upon some of this or that that the violence that has taken place I'd I don't see a lot of possibility of acts just as in Mexico is capable of\nOf dealing with those issues um and we can play 'em all day long but the fact is that all of those drugs are headed here I mean the other end where where the ... market and we really can't blame them for the fact that we\nAre marking his created havoc on on that side of the border um and so yeah we waiting for this new administration and see if they can actually pull things together um [noise]\nYeah yeah I I heard an interesting theory and the other day about about why we have so much a\nLittle by little crime here you know and that is you know and that is that um\nThat all that drugs with all of the drugs that are coming across the last thing you know they had one at the cartels wants to you is to see 'em any ice if any any significant island Paso yeah citing any any uh last you know anything like a guild or anything like that and it can really put slammed the door on this thing's\n... said to be any way the primary corner of drugs why and so that's where everything is nice and quiet and our own health half of that either\nI mean says have are all just like that are in fact radio into a to say correctly on the radio a phrase that that would apply you don't ... where you can assume that they're not and basically like another the concept here that they're not interested in going fouling up their marketing to or if it were the things going in the news and I mean the significant times that has popped up on the news was during some of the people\nThere was the the boxing match held in the ... but there were concerns about you know we're going to be having that cartel bigwigs show up there and it got even reported that there was a an unofficial ... declared that they could also you know attend and have a good time there and again not foul up his side of the border from themselves I think\nThat's what we have here is a truce with you on this side of the border as a matter of fact I'm you know if you think about it and in fact we always hear that they've done a lot of uh here in the capital of the leaders are and they go you know in fact five over here and they live over here and they came over here and they go with their lives I mean\nThe problem I mean yeah it and it makes it even in the truce or or what works I mean the problem that\nAnd the real reason that I think that the Mexican regime but the any regime is going to have issues for what you see the problem when they're all the conflict between her tells me that was going on it that we don't want us during the real the real high out of the violence is\nIt wasn't that a cartel was in control why is that there was no gr Helen control and there was an adult go over and over they won one car tells you control\nThings quiet down or the fish are perfect them it's certainly not as an ... they're just doing whatever they want but then they are doing it may they used more surgical more beneficial way to them it's when there's the cartel violence going while the conflict between the ...\nWhen do you see it which is that without having body hung from a menu of the ... not just in our towns on it yet but ...\nThat are ... ... lack of course as well lack of competition and the ... I mean yeah but it it it's the scenario if in other words once you realize that it's not that there's a lack of her tell it's a there's a lack of competition and the cartel is what leads to the piece in areas like waters and other parts of might not have to be what's\nGoing on right now nomination between the cartels and wet and starts to raise concerns is windows gangs started getting desperate for fun and art and I'm getting desperate for recruiting that are there have certainly had kidnapped and his last when you start seeing the protection money and that's the only in maybe a search attracting\nAgain we have our national attention he'll far there has been some of that in ... but not as much as I was ... at least in a different way or the money to be done with and I mean again we have all this national attention to here\nAnd for the most part it's been on semi cause you to I mean it's been engaging at least at a different way than to just do have a border violence before this and say well is there something that needs to still be done when he when he was on on the on our ... year to to make sure that people fully understand it or\nOr do you think that we're beyond the part where people are just gonna say okay we'll border violence was born in violence don't go anywhere near the border here when one or are we beyond that or is that still a dangerous\nYou know I think it is probably as tell her thank you well and and we don't know yet how bad when things like that I'm going to get in order for us here when one ... and you know al ... symptom of all of that you know is it really is in refugee you as well and he had all these kids Antonio ... only four hundred and she is\nBut she had an ... that's getting that's getting a lot of anxious and these days and all again much of that again is because of the drug war in in Mexico and some extent it is\nYou know that she fleeing Central America in love but we have to end and what the content because where are the people who are trying to get away with us in Spanish ... exactly 'cause working at the other ... you know order experience right in the middle of it but we don't exactly feel like being in there because we're the Yahoo ending a point where a year ago they aren't necessarily\nProcess well exactly because what the kind of the tail end of that last part of their experience originating in wherever they are more than ... may be in in central of South America and ending that'll be wrong here though they aren't necessarily cross as much here was being brought here I mean remember during the last um refugee does in the company minor crisis there were showing people being brought but\nThey were coming here and being processed by our local ... because the places where they were crossing like in Brownsville were just overwhelmed\nSo a whole lot of a capsule Asian of issues here and a lot of stuff going on I guess we talk about a little bit during the last break on the Facebook Live but are you guys are always hopeful about the future of I mean we've got a lot of serious issues going on but do things seem for rights when you step back and look at it all\nI'm really helpful I mean there's so much uh to be excited about here in El Paso I mean as I was as saying during the break I mean I'm not I wasn't born here at my wife and I got here ten years ago we choose to be here it's a great place to live as easy to live here I'm despite all the ...\nI think are a construction we are talking about you go to any other city and we can't complain about the trafficker low cost of living I mean you can buy a house here for so much less than you can tell you I mean that's really a quality of life issue because that puts more money in your your pocket to go to places like top Gulf and the ballpark [laughter]\nSo maybe it'll be maybe it will be able to turn the label them and go to their to develop their own unique parts of this region to the mountains ... gorgeous hiking or being you're on the border of even we're talking about the violence here it's still the border culture is wonderful\nI going across the water is is a is a great trip and I think sometimes we take for granted being so close to it it's fantastic living\nYeah and travel a lot of people from El Paso who are past the ones you know wouldn't even dream of going over to a lot of these days there were just crying shame matter of fact but uh you know there's still possibly could get caught up in something\nBut um but it was when we landed in front of them and going on and bought us right now and uh and it's a it's a nice city are you in the daytime at least\nWorth ... come to the end of our time here want to say thank you to our guests are David crowd her and rub your great thanks very much for

promote commissions and and we we want everybody knows Paso to uh be it'd be like ... or to this city is wonderful city that we have and to promote the icons that we have done in the valley\nWas people understand the history they they tend to repeat it was somebody's is where you're from whatever happened there and then you get a lot of answers from people if they study the Paso history because there's so much of it it's an emission trail is a biggie it's so it's\nBig and it's getting bigger every time every week that goes by and believe it or not I learn something new about the history about the area or things like that and it's very into slated\nIf it was the first big highway ever in North America is the ... and the mission trail\nIs a major part of the I've had people to New Mexico tell me we don't really have the commuter rail no Paso I said I got news for you dude I don't have the ... you don't have the commuter rail and it's as simple as that yeah and so and what

through and also that the topography has changed a bit I mean the river moved Oh yes I'm more into politics follow that oh my goodness everything all at the fan when they've agreed to Mexico is losing land to the United states because the river was encroaching south\nRight that's the way you see it in a concrete ditch right now it's not going anywhere right absolutely I Know that's that's just the hit but the point is the boundaries shifted\nAnd so all the missions that are on the El Paso mission trail all of a sudden became American United States yes people need to realize that they used to be in Mexico it's when they when all that hit the fan so just to get that figure it out a ... is a start\nBut the mission trail itself ... are part of it I think is nine or ten miles isn't it it's about
