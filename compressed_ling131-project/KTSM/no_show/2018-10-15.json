when you play and when you play the music and when you pay the costs and yet so it is it's always a toll on different from one place to another\nSo the more you go to the ... a sauce the more it's like a ...\nAnd the more you go in and that um notice in the region as a little bit more classic so\nMore and more people might expect to see if they've seen you know videos ... interesting so you've got the food we got the dancing and also mentioned or what kind of art is going to be on his way or going on\nWe're going to have art from um the different museums of Audi impartial now now we're going to have the Tyson museum are going to have that battle we're going to have um like ... ... of all those museums ... um\nWe're going to have example so examples of what they are good and what's what's going on so slow yes you know just\nGreat for examples of of Spanish and I'm culture war going on yeah so so the event is a according Nineteen so it'll be a powerful country club and um what is the the ticket price go to support\nThe ticket prices are going to support scholarships in fact we're giving our first caller ship this year um and ah so we've been doing this since twenty fourteen we're a very young company a company where you're very young organization which anybody can be a member of if you love\n'em you know Spanish culture and art we invite you to become a member but the um the tickets are actually going to go to provide scholarships for students so would want to study in Spain\nOkay so people um um other degree in the United states or even locally they want to go and uh

Bend in up to the panhandle\nOkay and so the prices for members of the herd it'd be anyone can become a member you said right\nMembership is thirty dollars per person or sixty dollars for a couple\nUm we also have a a Fifteen dollar membership or what is it for the students\nFifteen twenty five twenty five for I didn't know for for a for the year the ticket price for the dinner is a hundred and twenty five dollars for members and one fifty for non members\nLittle group we thought well there is no a Twenty one walk for freedom in El Paso let's bring it to El Paso and so that's what our endeavors to those few of our goals for this year just starting out as a group of common citizens who want to make a difference\nSo going to be in the advocacy the awareness that a bit of fundraising so what are you planning next where do you want to you know grow and start being able to do into\n[noise] we we actually um are going to this is our main event for this year with our main goal but as we go into the new year we really want to become a presence in the community to help people get to know us\nUs for us to get to know them to really be become you know it's an organization that they recognize that they trust that they know and that they understand our goals and objectives and what we're we're wanting to do you want to tell him that table ing and some of the\nWell we we found out really quickly that you can't just jump in in a safe way and start rescuing people so we don't want to make decisions like that and think that we can go be saviors to a bunch of people who are really hurting and struggling as professionals\nAnd um the law enforcement as well as the shelters in the city who are the ... there for those things and we're not going to we're not going to try to be that 'cause that's not what we are\nSo supporting those we are supporting them in whatever way we can and we're also feel like raising awareness in El Paso is our main goal for right now as we grow so going on beyond the walk we plan to be at a lot of local events in festivals and labeling\nUm just to raise awareness of human trafficking continuously throughout the community getting the word out there that yes this is in El Paso and it should ... as a community we should not tolerate that\nI mean it's it's definitely it'll pass away and then we move through al Paso I mean we're we're again we're major trend a court order and stuff as you if you're not seeing if there is definitely is here and passing through here which means that we all need to be very aware of what's going on\nRight now because of local citizen is the one we are the ones who are going to notice and see if we know the signs and we're going to be the ones that can report it to the local law enforcement\nAnd so that's why in most cases where awareness isn't just a few a good thing it's an active thing makes you know and know what to look for and understand the signs and ... calling law enforcement or the agencies that can help these people absolutely\nThere's and there's several layers to it and the more the community is aware and his ... and the watch for it the more that the stereotypes against the victims will break down around the community which is a whole nother aspect um and and that they'll see things and they'll demand that stops and so that's our goal for right now\nBut I said well they're very good goals and Barry Newton or community\nAre going to walk for freedom will be held October twenty registration at ... am on the website to go to more information as a Twenty one door we
