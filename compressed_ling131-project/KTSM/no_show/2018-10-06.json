{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "Who who seem to want to portray us as unsafe and it's it's untrue and now I Will tell you El Paso was safe even before there was a wall so you know were there were there a kind of like petty crimes fast a burglary yeah\nBut the the big factors that thinks that way into determining community safety you know I'm a murderer a sexual assault et cetera we have we have\nBeen a very safe community for decades and decades I mean I even before there was a wall when I worked for\nA re cut by it or in two thousand one is is communications director I remember putting out those press releases every year of oh once again you know for the X number of year in a row we are one of the safest cities in America and again before there was a wall\nSo um [noise] you know I always try to stress that when when when talking a national audience is because I don't want people to believe\nThe ... of the wall and our safety and that they are linked they are not\nUm but you know so the question is how do we how do we approach enforcement how should we approach enforcement since you know we can all agree that there needs to be some\nI think number one we now need to on Lincoln from comprehensive immigration reform and we need to say we've achieved all a certain amount of metrics our net in migration even at its peak this year are at historic lows\nI'm most communities including El Paso are ... among the border are safer than most communities in the interior of the country um and you know so they're metrics that have been achieved\nThat we need to stop saying we need to continue to secure the border is secure um you know ... ... now let's have the debate about comprehensive immigration reform you said we needed to secure first check it's done\nBut we also part of why we need to get to the the reforming our immigration laws is and and it's not just immigration laws it's drug laws as well if the reason behind building walls is to keep\nA criminal element out and to ... keep drugs out then there there are ways to approach this the public policy that would achieve that so it or you know we we we have to look at America's insatiable appetite for illegal drugs\nWe have to look at how we've criminalized drug use and addiction we also need to look at economic migrants and why they come back and forth and where they're headed and the value that they perform in our country\nAnd it's I think when we begin to address those elements and public policy\nIt it allows us to shrink the population that we're really focused on which is the population that may be wanting to come and do us harm not the economic migrants coming to you know work in fields that gets food on our table\n[noise] um you know not people who are coming to try to be reunited with their family but you know the element that we want to focus on\nAugust ... into discussion about both um winter and um the worst year to read from the from the immigration debate and then also the um\nThe the L the United states is appetite for drugs or those reasonable things to to expect to be able to accomplish with any kind of timeframe I mean the laws to those the immigration ... had been worked very very ...\nPartly for for quite some time now and also we were talking about all the all the you know the United states demand part of this the the drug ... for for decades now I mean is there anything really new there can be done there\nYou know here's where I Am hopeful there are a record number of seats that are up for grabs in the Congress in part because of retirements you know we have a lot of folks retiring um\nWho have chosen not to run for reelection\nAnd so we're going to have a lot of new people in Congress my hope is is that folks like me who are ready to really create true reform whether it's reforming campaign finance laws or reforming drug laws reforming immigration laws\nThat you know that that we have a majority to be able to do that we need a majority in the Senate and ultimately in twenty twenty we're going to need a change in the White House in order to accomplish it\nNone of these are easy quick fixes 'em you know but but that's why you have to have people who are willing to put into very very hard work to get it done and build the relationships necessary to get it done\nOkay we'll have a caller on the line we have a believe we have ... joining us\nIs the first chance at which in mourning mourning program but I Do have a question for Mr ... okay I don't know why you are not actually for\nIt today if he told the truth but a wire or Jew or securing the border wire you for open borders\nOkay smart for the question um I think I was pretty clear in my response that I'm not a believer in open borders you know having no laws having no boundaries um have never set that have and you'll never find me quoted as saying that I've never written about that\nUm I Want to have a safe community I Want to have a safe country\nBut I think that military rising the border is not the way to create a\nSafer communities are safer country it's a in building things like monumental walls are I in my view a colossal waste of money and they don't get to the underlying problems that we have and that were allegedly trying to fix with building things like walls\nSo that I guess I'm measuring your what were were ... you don't want to have in place where I guess what aspects of border security or are you in favor of\nSo I absolutely believe we need um a well trained border patrol I Believe we need a you know well trained customs and border protection a agents\nUm you know I I I'm not with the abolish ice movement at all um but I Do believe that those uh agencies need greater accountability greater oversight greater transparency because as they've grown and as the federal government has invested in growing them over time\nUm there's not been the same ah\nInvestment in accountability transparency and oversight [noise]\nYou know whenever you grow an agency you should grow a all of those areas as well so I I Do believe we need in fact we don't have enough customs and border protection agents at our ports of entry we need more so that we're able to keep people moving back and forth and they're a key element in that\nUm but I'm not for building walls I again I think they're a colossal waste of money but I Am for reforming immigration laws that help us focus on those that we ... that that may be here to do us harm versus economic migrants or those seeking family reunification\nOr would you be more in support of the the kind of the the technological wall has been discussed with more like a drones not armed drones have been used elsewhere but what sensors drones monitoring certain areas to see but you know we know when people are coming across as opposed to again the physical barrier to to inhibit that\nYeah I'm I you know I'm I'm open to technology and I think technology ... plays an important role\nFor local law enforcement for federal law enforcement you know when I was county judge we made significant investments and new radios for example and a vehicle technology for sheriff's deputies and all of that comes with a hefty price tag\nI don't know that the federal government has made those same modernization and investments in technology um you know as as they should have over the years and I do believe in manpower and but but I uh I again with added manpower and presence we\nNeed at a training and we need added accountability transparency oversight all of the things that are important to keeping a community holistically safe\nSo there are the biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their CWC I already all do\nMiss the comic performances\nTo be biggest\nThis [noise]\nThis conversation it was great I don't want the opportunity and again you can watch us over there right now over on the taco Paso page and we'll be back next week with Robby great editor bill pass away with the issue round up you've got so if you want to talk about that will be your chance\nBeen listening to Taco Bell so if you're a news radio six Ninety will catch you

throughout the day on different topics such as\n... researching buildings in neighborhoods speakers are scheduled yes and actually Robert ... big ... big I probably going to speak about genealogy and one thing we're doing this year as\nMaking our event bilingual ... some of the presentations will be in Spanish\nAnd we are absolutely thrilled that this year I attend as binational so we actually have\nSome archives fancy that virus that are participating as well including that causes a dad do they mean than and they ah university\nState advise their library special collections department\nWell Dennis what are you bringing to the to the literally bringing to the table next Saturday yeah literally bringing to the table were so we're all going to have these tables where we're going to bring materials from our collections and you can imagine the diversity of the collections because we have such a diverse\nUh archives and museums in the region and so it's a it's a really a regional thing between ... El Paso ... says your archives of general librarian and it's in our tribe yeah so we're we're an academic library or we're at the library we are in the library of New Mexico State University\nAnd uh so what we plan to bring a we haven't finalized our selection but one thing we we will probably bring or some some maps that will show the development of this region\nSo from a the time before the Mexican American War a\nSo will show this area as part of Mexico and then er during the Mexican American War when the border started to change and then maps after Eighteen fifty three when we have the border that that exist today when did when this new Spain go away\nNew Spain went away and Eighteen Twenty one Twenty one year when Mexico or one her independence and so then this area became a part of Mexico and uh was part of Mexico until Eighteen forty eight and then New Mexico formed as the territory\nOut of that [noise] not not for after but not at the same time\nCorrect yes so New Mexico for a New Mexico was a territory and new Spain oh it was a garbage or yeah going back to about sixteen hundred went on one they're not they came up through here uh but uh it became a territory of the United states in Eighteen forty eight and do you know where they had their major party when they became a state of Nineteen twelve\nWhere El Paso okay it was the only big city around that they could have enough place for a party to occur\nWell one of one of the main people involved and that was a senator Albert bacon fall yes oh it was from New Mexico but lived in El Paso I'm\nOn a history that guy who put together they're right well Robyn you have any history of baking him Mr ...\nAll we have a little bit at the Historical Society we have some of his books that detail or Mexican relations during the Mexican revolution or with the U.S will not the Mexican revolution the U.S but but relations that there were occurring at the time\nAnd we actually have a piano that came out of his house um it is a a a square baby grand piano the dates back to about Eighteen thirty five that was in his ... house on Arizona avenue that's correct that's correct along with two portraits of him in one of his wife science or the historical that case I knew who\nWas a little girl at the time an elderly woman now she used to play that really should have talked to her if you do this and ... there's some history still lingering in El Paso\nOh of course and you don't want one of the great things about working with our colleagues down here in El Paso is there there are so much shared history so we have a Albert making false papers and our archive and so I Know we just received a question from a Robert ah regarding the piano to see if we can find some documentation and the papers about the piano so we are going to look into that for him next week\nHave you looked in there and see if there's any extra notes and they're from the little kids of the day there may be you never know\nThere aren't a we have looked inside and we just found a class that's supposed to cover up the keys of it that was that was the extent of it but otherwise it's an historic beyond because it sounds like a game before that the trains\nThat is correct and and the the company that built the piano manufactured those kennels between eight and thirty four and Eighteen thirty six so I'm really ... they were that shape and size\nFrom my understanding and I haven't been able to to to lock this information down but from my understanding it was for the the ease of transport and then they were also fashionable in the Eighteen they sit in the wagon exactly\nExact the bigger ones could fit on the trains and you could get 'em in here that's right straightened up when the transit the fan I mean that changed loss cruises the less\nCruises got cross country trains before oh Paso okay did it not\nYet the train came to enter last Christmas I Believe in Eighteen eighty one of which actually changed the ... the political a layout of of the area because a previous to that ... was was the important town and and the county seat\nAnd uh after the train came through the the folks in to see it didn't want the train coming through and see us so it came through last Christmas and they moved the county seat to last cruise ships\nThey had a little bit of trouble there with the with the land is well the real rose didn't really want to build in its do more body over there and up towards the mountains it was easier to put a train through I mean it's a dream people do so the history of being what it is we've got some people in the studio here this morning we're in engrossed in history shall we say you lived history don't you\nYes well that's kind of a job that's ... that says that we do you make history accessible and terms that preserving historical records I arranging describing then sit there for the researchers and then making them available to the pop back\nYou're listening to Abby wiser she's with ... these special collections and who's that name for\nIts name for the out phonics than who has a long time an English professor eat cat\nAnd he also it's deeply interested in history and he caught in South at grassroots historian and he has a prolific author I read it many his days after I reach an eye including a pass at the north I saw him line Anthony and him so he knew stuff he did\nDo you think he would agree that Texas history begins in El Paso\nNow you know you don't know I I well\nYour market yeah it depends where you might get I guess I'm so used to thinking as I said it's a region so I think that this past I don't know I tell\nWhen you get a hold of Texas the rest of them have\nAn attitude we don't yet obvious what we would like to say is I'll pass or history as part of New Mexico history\nAnd and we wouldn't have a community all if you didn't\nCorrect so we're tied by the commuter rail and a huge I I've had people in the northern New Mexico tell me we don't have the commuter rail a civil of I don't have a you don't have it and what they meant was they didn't see the rush in the desert we pay them over we still use them\nThey have written a desert they don't use any more\nSo where's the history there but it's still all history and the thing that would you have a special collections name on your special collections in in a mess you know we're just the archives and special collections so it was so not named after any any particular brand simple yeah we're we're keeping a new a new ... it could make some day if you do it right it could be the dentist daily [laughter] there you go there you go\nAnd the ... and over Burgess house or you have ah the the paranoia library\nThat is correct that is correct Jane bridges paranoia was Richard bridges his daughter and a after Mr Burgess died in Nineteen forty five she took over the house she lived there until Nineteen eighty six and then at that time she quit the house to the history of the house came from the daughter\nThat's correct she made the plans with the Historical Society beginning around Nineteen eighty two and then they were finalized in Nineteen eighty six and then she passed away in that same year\nWell she was a benevolent person but she was she did she didn't leave you something that does require care once in a while so you have to deal with a house\nThat is true it's a one hundred and six year old house a built in Nineteen twelve or the renovations done in Nineteen twenty seven\nBut as a historic home as an older home we're always dealing with things here and there are in August we had a leak in what we called the bride room uh we've had weddings you know about thirty weddings over the years and and typically the brides get ready in that particular bedroom\nBecause there's a functional bathroom connected to it and there was a leak and we've been dealing with the insurance company and the contractors for about a month now although as luck would have been if anybody wants to build a plumbing help or cash absolutely we lived three three three six oh three or five thirty three thirty six zero through that it's ... I got that writers have\nBeen in my memory and I worked closely with the society over the years yes ... well the whole idea of the Historical Society and any town is that they usually are the keeper of the flame whatever that may be and that's no different here you guys have all the history that your key Graham Graham in there absolutely\nAbsolutely and you know it it's wonderful you know what's interesting about archives in general is that you know no one archive is going to have everything pertaining to a region for example um and we have quite a bit in our collection number twenty thousand photos of thousands of documents hundreds of maps and book scores of of objects\nBut of course we don't have everything either and so it's always a pleasure to work with ah people like Abby people like Dennis uh because we can round out the history and the region how accessible is your collection to the public it's a very accessible we're open Monday through friday from tend to to ah also by appointment and\nThat we're not officially open on Saturday where usually there on Saturday doing work so if you stop by will open up for you Oh thank you for\nBeing here today normally you're overdoing exactly exactly we try to get you on an average as your collection of ... of the public\nYes we are open to the public and\nAnd um so he married into the sky quite prominent Mexican family and then his children George Griggs or one of his children um was in Chihuahua moved down to Chihuahua and spent many years down there\nAre among the papers of the collection that we received our our ... correspondence between George Greg's and people are like um Mr that us one no one set us\nUp to the guy from the northern yeah I'll watch the big landowner and and she lived in a hotel here for a while and then I Believe they also lived in eighty four mansion oh we're short period yeah you put them up there yeah\nSo uh and then it was the children I Believe of one of George ... his brother\nWho married a child as and all of these recipes come from the ... that's the source yeah the ... family atmosphere she passed the recipes on to her children one of her daughters was a woman named Katie Griggs who started ... and ...\nOne of the children I Believe was Edgar Greg's who started Greg's restaurant down here in El Paso and another sibling started the up into restaurant up in Albuquerque ... somebody in that crowd was an historian in in your region in\nAnd then within Historical Society person for a long time or something yeah and actually ran a museum and Missy ... called the Billy the kid museum district back in the teens and twenties right that was George Greg's yeah so there's a lot of history that came out of that era that is still to be discussed absolutely yeah oh that's fun stuff All right we're gonna have to take a break and come back in a moment and [noise]\nAnd now the heart radio we can sports time capsule\nFor fans of Sandy West and I'm here to take you back on a journey to this week in sports history of the star way back in Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play\nThe Boston Americans beat the Pittsburgh Pirates five games to three and a best of nine series this week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call\nThree points to center field before ... into the Wrigley Field bleachers in the fifth inning game three of the world series and the Yankees won seven to five this weekend Nineteen fifty one third baseman Bobby Thompson hits a one out three run home run on the bottom and the ninth inning to win the national tennis for the New York giants Thompson's homerun wrapped\nUp in amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees\nBut Tom says miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains his W.

I don't think we'll be their their their archivist or will be there and a couple of other folks resume and very knowledgeable people yeah and amazing stuff that they have out of that that that place you know as as a Cold War history is is really see that they're at the white sands missile range really amazing\nLet me tell you about something weird artifact that Robert probably doesn't know existed but at one point there was any big Plexiglas box a piece of the tower\nFrom that event was in the historical societies are driving the back room and people got nervous and got rid of it\nAnd so what we did was well I mean I I doubt if there's a yeah because it had been there ever since the forties right right and somebody decided I'd better go out to the white sands missile range so that's where it went\nSo but it it's figured Historical Society all have a big dinner coming up here it's going to be me just tell you what I Know you tell me what you can ... Paul foster press jerk up Dr ... CEO daily and tell us auto so that's why do you want is they are the two thousand Eighteen hall of honor banquet on a ...\nAt the El Paso country club six PM on November the for\nThe call Robert for tickets five three three three six oh three what else is there to know these are interesting people\nYes so the whole of honor is something that we've done for fifty years now it's an opportunity for us to\nShowcase sort of the the best that will pass though has to offer the the arteries who've included a Richard Burgess Dr dining at the Lucille a maple Welsh um they have all contributed to a Paso I'm significantly in one way or another\nAnd uh the event is that the country club November fourth from six PM to nine PM or tickets are a hundred dollars a but you'll get to see these for individual uh the present and it really is just a wonderful opportunity for us to to showcase\nUm some of the best aspects of the past us history too are deceased and to be there there are those are the disease that is correct or their families will be the right and so that's that's the wonderful thing too that we get we get to honor a individuals who may not be with us anymore but but their families always loved to to be at these events\nFall foster people probably know who he is he's worth saving a lot of history and downtown El Paso West Africa has been a staple in El Paso history a promotion at the at the county ... historical commission that's right wherever and then these other two people are missing your daily as you've ... in this in the black studies there\nAre all kinds of stuff he he did but who is Mr mom tests so that was an interesting ah so just just a a quick little background people submit nomination forms every year and so a Mr month this is great grandson\nA submitted dissemination form a Mr month this was a Texas Ranger and suddenly ... in the late Nineteen century and he fought in the salt wars he was a judge in Senate lease audio he contributed to public education out there\nSo this man's history it's quite fascinating and we're we're glad that we're able to to add him to our list it'll be interesting to hear this perspective because some of the Texas Rangers came to that event at the salt would did not go home that is correct to kill the few um\nUnfortunately I mean this guy made it that he made it he made it and he contributed a great deal to the Senate lease audio region over the years they could look at that as a possibility for November the force Sunday night beginning six PM wreck you gotta something over there\nIn October twenty if this was funny that I've done this several times it's a walk through history ... cemetery it's eleven in the morning to all three of the entrance to this as a thirty seven hundred yen do that's called the

ladies you know there are award winning and they perform at eleven thirty one thirty\nEven better see that's the that's the point of history and how it works if you find a shoe box with stuff in it give it to Abby or your dentist or give it to Robert because you guys would love to picture what would you not\nWait wait but more importantly once we gather these stories than the archives are actually usable because now we have\nA history of this family out of it has been here now passed though a forever fifty years six years and more and so it's really telling the stories of our community and I'll agree with what Roberts said\nThat history as learning about people and their stories it's not just about memorization updates\nAnd that's one important thing to have with the archives bizarre\nIs that we're having a wide variety of different institutions participating Fran art museum in history museum's I\nUh we have to give it to have biodiversity I collections participating that carried her Vicki I it's going to bring some examples from her collection so that's a science related archive\nBiology rent late at night it'd be fun so it's really all this the plans are for archives I Know we focus on history but it's really our collections can help ah what's the rioting everything\nJust went up to okay with it could break and come back in and look at the ideas of how people

major original ... operators that the tram way since not quite day one but pretty long ago well I bet\nA worked there for forty four years already for Yes sir ... gracious\nAnd there's nothing about the tremor you don't know I'm guessing\nWell no not really a there's always something to learn\nA lot going on there also we ask another guy to join us this morning and he has done so by telephone Mike Louis how are you dude Hey Mike\nI'm I'm doing great how are you all\nWe're doing good we're talking tram we kind of a sad moment but now the jury you brightened up our day just briefly what you

moment garden in the middle of a block party or the coping neighborhood cargo which is a lot of fun\nYou are you if you know how to party I Do know that the way Mr in El Paso am I what come here and also let's let's go around the room here at talk to everybody including Mike is not in the room but Diane Tell us what's your what's your involvement with the history is what\nAre you know about the trembling and what does the condition now maybe you can do is tell us that\n[noise] ah well I've only been at the park for about four years and so I dunno\nNearly a not even when\nI think if I may shouldn't have to have said I Will ask cabinet and yeah he's quite up to\nThat yesterday or the ... and you know more about that and then if I have you know I read it across his ... at that point is going to say and to say they know they\nAre trying to figure out what's going to happen in LA looking options I'm however ways to having their programs anything we have to get into any of the shops are high studying say actually happening at the base station at the base station or I wasn't sure you're going to do that or not yeah they start game that\nWe might have to defend against like say now to having I danced appetite Michael what\nWas your history with the ... volunteer ranger there for a long time\nFor volunteering under bet do as a matter of fact um gosh I don't even know how many years ago maybe seven eight nine ten\nYears later I got you beat he has forty four back they're just a little more than me [laughter]\nBut I've always loved being there just because it's such a unique place so many parents have not had the chance to go up and I can't tell you how many times I'll be a writing in the car and and explaining to people what park is and what the ... in the history of it and almost\nEvery single time we go up or at least one person in the car has lived in El Paso all their life and I've never been on it\nWe've got to fix that well I Hope we can fix that we'll see how they turn to bang on see I told you I told you buy a messenger email on Facebook to my plan is to win the lottery and go fix the traveling too [laughter]\nSo I got the same plan huh [laughter] well maybe we can do it together ... or ... that the you've been there were you there were you there you were there when it was one car\nNo no not not really I was there when I'm there was still called operation but it was the old number one the one that's sitting there and as it is sort of ... there at the parking lot yes the number one and number two yes\nWell what are you what are your thoughts about the history there I mean you you spent your life there\nWell I did a spent quite a few years there I Love the place\nUm I met a whole bunch of people that are really made my life interesting uh I met a lot of people from the cake this studio and a Mr Weiner himself in a lot of the engineers are used to work up to three up that the transmitter yes\nWell one point they had to have a guy in the building up at the top right\nOriginally every day they have to have somebody to turn on and off a the transmitter yeah they didn't have the uh the equipment at bay that a ... express now you know to be able to control\nIts automated now yes automated now and so but now they don't send anybody up there and yet Diane that tremor still works if you need to get up there for an engineer\nMad at them and they all kind of figure that out\nSo that's an engineer wants to go up that you'd have to climb the mountain yet just sick about that for a minute like\nThat uh you know I was in high school are back in Nineteen sixty one or sixty two and my wife's grandfather worked there from the get go all the time we when they built that Mr Fred ...\nAnd a one time they had a a mosque function of the car and people spend the night uh up there at that regular peak\nAnd back then there wasn't a lot of building there I'm not a lot of building a it was cold [laughter] oh yeah because he was in the wintertime and there was even a couple a newlyweds they spent their honeymoon after a couple of ... honeymoon up there at the at the er at ranger ... we\nShouldn't ask any more details about that one but I bet that was different [laughter] you're not going to have you ever climbed up on a on your own on without the trembling does ...\nMany times yeah several hikes up there there's a couple of trails one that starts in the parking lot or on the east side of the mountain that goes up it's called the direct seem a trail and then there's one that start sort of in the Palestinian found the lifestyle\nAmounts and at\nThe end of standing street and come up or the left side west slope and that's called the ten thousand steps trail I did count wants a little bit more but\nIf you really you ten thousand is not enough well what do you explain to people real quick what that was it was it was put in by construction people for the for the phone or the power lines right\nRight right here are electric company and actually they still have a little hot\nThat for years to store equipment and right for you know helicopter came more liberal or to to bring that up there but um\nI mean I'm assuming the trails are still open but with the folks in the in the studio probably know\nBetter than I gather or break break rate hikes we've got an honoring\nThat was well it ... the power poles had to go from the Rio Grande power plant over by Cristo Rey over to for a less\nAnd less way was over the mountain and so the first time they did it they they carry polls up the mountain and to do that what they did is they took a piece of the sedimentary rock and flipped it over and they went up a little bit and flipped another one and then flipped another one and those are your ten thousand steps\nOtherwise how can you make step on a mountain like that but that it's a fascinating place and we do hope it gets back open well but don't tell us some of the early things have happened in in your in your world that you remember the\nThe ... the construction before was open to anybody there was a a a wasn't a car that went up and down it was a bucket have you seen that\nFilm ride I I've seen that they're saying I have pictures of that myself um the construction was a quite a feed you know there was a a forty people they hiked up there with piano wire and then they started sneaking up a cables until they got the the main cable up there\nBut uh it was quite a quite a job you know\nWell that and then what I saw a video of it is that old film of transferring to video and it was a you had to it was a bucket where the pull up the middle the polls attached to the cable\nAnd somehow went up and down and if you wanted to stay in that thing you held onto the poll that site otherwise you'd get flipped out of the bucket [laughter] and I saw in the film like oh my goodness this was a hazardous pay duty back there\nYou know back in Ninety seven uh I I quit working for another company to start my own communications company and that's when I first met ...\nAnd uh I had my own repeaters up on the mental fun in that building it was widely assumed that the why their side and uh in technology has come around so much more since what we were talking about with buckets because I remember a trench transfer putting my equipment up there we had to use it on one of the flat\nOne of the flat or cars or whatever you call it the fact that it's not for me if left arm and a very interesting you know I I don't know I every time I rode that tram up there I was always thinking I Hope that little cable holes\nIn 'em [laughter] 'cause it's a pretty good dropped down [laughter] oh yeah well so far it has I may [laughter] and\nThey have two of them now so what what did at one time that the the whole thing was replaced it at some point because I remember seeing pictures were the main or re on top of the building was a little further over toward the mountain and am I wrong in that\nI Know uh uh the are you talking about the power out that\nOne has to be stationed there was that the towers at the base station we're in a different place on the building at one point\nNo it's just that the building or expand it expanded ... of happened yeah okay I\n... my mind was like I wasn't as soon as I Am Michael we're going to take a break if you want to stick with us please do so well can you bring us back maybe after about ten thirty I'm eleven thirty\nAre okay but I Will put John holding drop off as you wish\nBut we're going to do what we call really a truly a trivia and it do we do we covered the trivia Rick I don't think we didn't cover for the second area uh we let's see if we if people can get these questions are not oh yeah we did\nOoh no here's the bonus when we didn't know
