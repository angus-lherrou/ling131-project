there are players would not be kneeling during the NFL anthem is a Dallas Cowboys I don't think anyone would presume the Dallas Cowboys don't understand ... access\nSo I think that you may have over corrected a bit in terms of some of that law lack of enthusiasm among Hispanic in an African American voters by going a little bit too far too fast and it created material for crews that have seized on with law enforcement leaders and certainly in the two televised debates them health he\nAlso has announced that ah that he opposes a ice and would like to abolish ice or at least picking up on some comments that have been made by other national Democrats um how does that issue like that which seemed to me would be another issue that might appeal to Hispanics\nBut do Hispanics in Texas do they want ice abolished\nNo better than an amazing job of identifying thirty percent issues with Texas voters are seizing them owning them and then not relent him\nAnd he does it over and over and over again he started on impeaching Trump that's thirty percent issue in Texas He started off expressing openness to abolishing ice\nYou started on sanctuary cities which he supports he started off thirty to train dollar Medicare for all proposal you go down the list um so again it if he was trying to sort of use a dog whistle to Hispanic voters to try to create enthusiasm\nThat strategy um we'll see if it works I suspect it won't work\nUh but but no ISIS popular a B because in Texas broadly speaking if you take out the urban areas where you have large concentrations of minority democratic voters are and I said to hundred and forty nine out of two hundred and fifty four counties in the state of Texas you have\nProbably pretty high up job approval for what the work that ice does and trying to shut down human trafficking uh trying to prevent or cottage trafficking trying to just basically enforce our laws which unfortunately is something the Democrats don't appear to be very interested in so\nI yeah I I'm puzzled I've never believed that too is going to win this race I actually don't think it's going to be that close at the end of the day he's never had a path to victory he's ever seen to understand the math in Texas and he's never moved to the middle in any meaningful way that's kind of like I just don't and that that's\nGoing to come to be a real shock to the Democrats but I'm the show for the last three weeks saying that he's going to be pulled the both the upset so well we'll save the type of their production invite him back after the election but let me ask one by one thing that came out of this article was Texas has the lowest voter\nTurnout of any of any country of any state rather the country\nYeah we do have very little very low turnout and I don't there there probably are reasons for that as well uh it's probably a complex picture um I think part of the reason is that our race our elections are just not been competitive for very long time as I said earlier Democrats I Want to state wide elections just Nineteen Ninety four their candidate for governor\nA has been such a disaster that she's going to lose about twenty to twenty five percent that he got it's\nIt's not just taxes swimming National League for the two thousand fourteen midterms Hispanic turnout nationally it was only twenty seven percent\nSo you've got a huge issue in Texas bad of course you know better than we could ever do that but this is I'm telling you as well as the Democratic party has got an issue across the country this is this was within the Hispanic community the community has to take responsibility for its own abdication abdication of his responsibility to exercise his constitutional right to vote\nAnd that was and that was appointed the NBC News article them and they use ... and the other is just one example and the wise there's problems in Arizona there's problems all over the country ah where are there doesn't appear to be a ... even the type of voter registration is not ... and Ronald barren as a question for you or a map go ahead\nMatt ... you'd mentioned this earlier and you kinda stole the thunder abide by bring this up but um you did mention that Hispanics are you know they're very hardworking they're socially conservative they're aspirational there and you know it maybe if we had a president that didn't call them rapists and murderers um\nThat they is it hot is it not possible that the Republicans actually have an opportunity to make really decent in Rosen of Hispanic votes if they did it properly [noise]\nAbsolutely absolutely they do and we have to be far more careful how we talk about the manic Americans at times some of our Republican leaders test use language that has been unhelpful where there's not a problem we've had in Texas and it's scary I think that'll buy ... you know but\nAlso situation where I you know governor Abbott running for reelection also according to the polls is doing very well\nAnd again the difference between this panic relationships\nBetween the Republican Party is very different from Texas as it is in the state of California Kobe I thank you very much for joining us to see they offer your assessment of the vote and uh in not only in Texas but also nationwide and so far as the Hispanics are going to turn out in large numbers they\nWas a surprise for the Democrats on the germs

[noise]\nWell come back to another edition of your past so public forum on your host Andrea book during this time around by Joe Lieberman daughters committee member for the mercy and Maryland retreat hosted by the queen of peace church very much for joining us hello thank you for having me here [laughter]\nSo ah the ... upcoming book is called the mercy and married retreat what ... what is this about\nThis retreat is going to be offered by father Michael gamely and it consists of having an experience\nWith the blessing mother happy her having us understand just a deeper understanding of adoration\nOne of the areas that he emphasizes greatly is a quote from St John Paul the second where it says how much the world needs to understand and accept defined mercy and he'd circles around this principle the entire conference and retreat\n[noise] so this is a a retreat basically run again to merge a merry specifically the known those you know the Virgin Mary and the way that the the Catholic faith\nUnderstands and has specific respect and admiration for yes exactly okay and so that'll be going on October twenty six I'm twenty seven or a queen ... piece on our beloved here on the west side right\nYes that'll be friday and on friday it starts at seven Fifteen PM and then on Saturday morning at seven forty five in the morning we definitely encourage everyone to be there thirty minutes before um before a seven forty five\nSo so increasing outrage and understanding of of the significance of bridge I'm areas in the Catholic faith ... what is what would be the draw for someone who who may not either be you know a perfectly practicing member or someone who might not be perfectly involved in the face at this point\nYou know we all walk a journey in life and um many of us look at the spiritual aspect of what life has to offer\nAnd I believe that for that individual who who'd simply wants to see what can I Do extra to allow this journey to the just incredible smooth and a amazing\nAnd I think that that is one of the most important things is it starts to enhance strengthening and just allow your spiritual journey to grow into a whole nother level\nSo for people who who might not be terrifically where which might not be that many people as well but there's a woman over says what would you characterize the nature of the religion joined me most most different ah aspects of Christianity focus on on Jesus as the Christ himself but then again in the Catholic faces a particular respect for for Mary\n[noise] you know the blessing mother and we call her the blessing mother the rules that she carries in our faith is primarily centered around she was a mama and a mother who had to journey in her life from the very beginning what it was like to raise her child with her husband Joseph\nAnd the ups and downs and so what we do is we look at her from that perspective we come to a point where we fully understand her role um and for that reason call her blessing mother as so many of us the um trials and tribulations that she faced here on earth\nHaven't um we face a mother's um each day of our life with our children and so she has become just an incredible example in for that reason we've been arrayed her and we use her to help us in our journey here on earth\nFor not just as a spiritual idea would also as a practical example in in many ways and just everyday life\nAbsolutely and and father ... that's an amazing job of allowing that to come to life for us\nAnd so your father do we um\nHe's a an author as well and he'll be the um one of the keynote speakers of speakers during the surgery correct\nYes yes and he is known for the book thirty three days of mourning glory well well I'm a respected and uh used by millions of people\nOkay so for this retreat what kind of an plus you know they're hearing speaking about things like that one of the kinds of things are people going to experience during this retreat\nWell we'll start with mass on Saturday mornings so for all of you who are going to be there um in early in the morning [noise] math will start will begin then we'll go out for a break to have a very simple breakfast\nAnd then he's going to begin a series of a conferences where he talks he allow he talks about a personal testimony that brought him to the time of of mercy um spins a great deal of time on St Paul I'm an St John ... seconds on the ... and the greater mercy a pope\nUm and then we'll then we'll have will break for lunch and then after lunch he'll continue with the conferences there is also going to be a period of time in which we will have an opportunity to meet him and to um\nExchange thoughts there'll be the end it his entire team will be coming in which are called immersing missionaries and we're going to have an opportunity to be there with him\nAll right so it's a friday registration and some of those men primarily Saturday's the primary of and so what kind of people don't just think that I mean what kind of position or mindsets of someone being really the most out of this kind of up\n[noise] I Believe the bats mindset that people can get is to understand that they're going to have a strong they're going to be able to develop a stronger commitment to their daily devotion and leave with a greater understanding of what their spiritual journey is going to be all about\nPeople who have been involved in this in the past who have gone through it have a have told you about what the experience was like\nThey can send me an email at ... Acosta an a a C. O. S. T.
