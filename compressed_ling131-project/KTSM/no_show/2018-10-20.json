{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "Well let's be honest America's a better place today than it was forty years ago or even six years ago\nUm there's no doubt about that\nBut we have taken a major step two steps probably five steps backwards with this idiot in the White House um\nHe has given a wink and a nod to these groups or the white supremacist groups and basically I'm given them the okay to\nCome from out of the shadows are\nComing up out of the underground and say you're evil vials spiel on race and so forth um\nDog dog whistles as we call them now dog was was except with him in trouble or\nHe is uh basically allowing them to say the things that they normally wouldn't be saying or a regular basis and um\n[noise] he approves it I refer to him is a white supremacist in chief um because he has their support David do good at Charlottesville David Duke even a little bit to the fact that uh they voted for Trump because he has their backs\nSo um\nWe have made progress significant progress but we've gone backwards with this a fool are occupying the White House\nAnd I definitely feel that that's just a lot more in the movie I mean let's talk about the timing here did you was there any particular moment you're trying to capture when you came out with the book was that just say that's when he got around\nTo telling it [noise] you know I've been asked a similar questions by by reporters are all over uh they want to know what my motivation was what I was trying to accomplish a\nThey have some idea that there's a big metaphysical thing to what I did I just wrote my story 'cause I had a unique story that I wanted to tell there was no intent no purpose in my eyes simply a had a unique story that I wanted to get out\nAnd I'm putting pen to paper I had no idea that it was going to unite the national discussion like it has than that I'd be in the middle of the conversation I'm I'm Glad it and then it's happiness result but there was no intent behind\nNo I think it would be fair to say that the movie is a bit more pointed at this point in time I mean there's a reason that you know Spike Lee and everyone was they they really captured on your stories that okay this is a story that needs to be told now at least is a sense he really seem to get particularly with that the closing segment of the movie\nSpike will tell you if he were here that they had to connect the events of forty years or forty years ago to the events of today in order to make the story ah\nHappened and uh he did a masterful job of connecting the events of or that I participated in in Nineteen Seventy two\nTwo thousand Eighteen I'm I have no complaints with what he did with my story a\nSpike is a master at his craft he is a to us the black community is a treasure\nCultural treasure I feel he should be a cultural treasure to America as large a his body of work speaks for itself and right now this is a punctuation and\nThe body of we're\nDefinitely and so there again rivers talks about how this my performance say a word season but that's something that that uh that spike or anyone else ever wants to really hear about at this point in time right\nWell they don't want to hear about it but spikes not here [laughter] ... here at ... you can see well here at I Believe we're going to do fine in the award season or in some capacity I think will be in the running a four major awards uh [noise]\nLast time I checked a they were citing six different categories um\nAnd uh\nOh I Know as pets and I will be the Academy Awards or in the Golden Globes during one of these shows at some point in time [noise] I'll\nLook forward to that for sure I'm One of the things I wanted to talk about in the book is some of the stuff that almost fits into that kind of stranger than fiction category some of the stuff that if they had put it on the screen\nPeople wouldn't have believed it I mean in in the in this\nUnbelievable story that I mean if you hadn't lived that people will be like you could you made that up you can but no one for like you can't you can't make that up expect people to believe it's two implausible there even some details that even if I can see why they didn't put on like describe what happened with with your head when you first joined when\nI was Nineteen and joined the department or the I had to go to see you tended in charge of the equipment requisition\nOr to get ahead um standard police cat [noise] and um I had a\nI had a little afro at that time and um\nThey asked me to a car I went to went to see him and he gave me a has those about is two sides is too small\nUm the skull crushing huh yeah wouldn't uh wouldn't get over my afro in fact the SAT on top of it um and I I'm told him it didn't fit the he left he said the country here and the fine I walked off\nAnd I decided to flip script on him and I walked around town in ... during lunch hour looking for a place to eat\nWearing this had on my head just sitting there looking like a fool and ah I I knew it looked like a fool people would haunt their horn pointing at me and I weigh battlement smile and a one day I came back to\nThe department and the chief of police was pulling up in his parking space and he saw me he said was your head on like that is a little too won't give me one the Fitch he said a telling to I said to get your head that fits your your head and a direct order\nI did and um he reluctantly gave me one eye reveled in the fact\nThat I have to be met his own game and I got to have to fit wow\nSo you you you got the happy but it took a\nOne of many you know small though impact the examples of the situation was again being you know the first black officer in a in Colorado Springs maverick wasn't I wasn't the first black also is the first button detected detective rather correction definitely want to get that correct because\nBut and then now one of the I think one of the best parts of the end of the book is that you kind of revisit those statistics as they are when when you published the book of where they are now now there's there's dozens of people you know black people on that particular force now is well\nI Believe the numbers right around forty a may have changed his book came out\nBut forty a blacks I'm One of them is a female looted two years ago they had a commander um which was the fourth highest rank of officer in in ... I'm not a progress has been made [noise]\nI certainly great so so since people are so enthralled here where to begin with is a copy of black klansmen or will be given away on line here the first person to comments with ah what Ron extra curricular in high school was it off in high school\nWill get this a signed copy of the book but I guess\nIf there's one thing you would want people really take away from this book and we we talked about a lot of different lessons connections to the Higgs\nIs not a thing in the past like a lot of people think and don't get hung up on the labels of clan of\nRight and you know Nazi skinheads are all one in the same they're entertained where you think people can do that in their lives\nI think people can infiltrate have by simply recognizing that the uh the problem exists the mosh Riggs is you can confront said monster infiltrated in your own personal life and deal with it that way\nUm don't be afraid of these people these people are your next door neighbors are people you sit next to Hugh in church or their everyday people who have this extreme a or ideology and you have to be willing to a capital\nSo does definitely functional or I Want to say thank you very much guys for coming on the show here we've been talking with Ron and Patsy ... worth of Mel black ... and the book and Mel movie fame and they do much for joining in with us joined us here on TALK of us will say thank you very much guys greatly appreciate you taking the time I got out of your whirlwind tour to come and speak with us here\nBack at home here in El Paso barrel best ones make no doubt people were happy to have you here things a little pride in Austin high price [laughter] then once they were doing this for taco Paso our guests next week we'll be congressional candidate Rick Seeberger got always looking for your comments and calls and the focus on a taco Paso on Facebook\nI my host aged ... to him to the next week at every Saturday\nNews radio six Ninety is Tate GSM am El Paso [noise]\nRadio I'm Angela at us and it's not patting official says Eighteen people are in custody\nFor the murder of Washington has ... Saudi Arabia top prosecutor announced the results of a limited investigation on state run TV friday the ... was killed in a brawl inside the Saudi consulate in Turkey two weeks ago president Donald Trump called the arrests a great first step\nTen o'clock and raises an added to ruin us get don't junior is here the man who has a job now is\nCreated business or the name of your wedding businesses\nFrom this moment what he ministry and what you do is marry people it's it all kinds of weddings do we do ... location weddings even go to the bridges ahead to what the prisons yesterday oh wow and that's so that's something that's really increasing you went in and imprisoned and they let you out that's it yeah check it out of jail card even\nBetter but Ruben is condone is also the man who was in charge of the uh the information shall we say about\n... Cristo Rey threats that's an unusual mountain\nIt is it is it has its history and of course has been there for Seventy night where the mountains been there for\nAges forty five million yeah that's right yeah I think popped up forty five million years ago out of nowhere yeah way more people long before I mean I take out here on yet they just barely made it in in the timeline but but the the whole unknown yucky went right by there\nThat's a very historic mountain because of what has gone on around it right and now it's on top of that is right and so for those who don't know explain it\nIt's on top as a monument to Christ\nThat was built in the Nineteen thirties was finished in Nineteen thirty nine\nAnd of course ah over the ages of our committee and our group is taking care of maintaining the monument to the ... the amount Cristo Rey restoration community that's right 'cause you're always restoring it it's it would restrict restoring and maintaining I think that's what a you know maintenance and kind of keeping it going for future generations has been the goal\nBut it's a constant constant battle I mean is this the last couple of months has been ridiculous why well because we order you know material to the the screening that goes on the road to cover a potholes and and the stuff that washes away and then we had a big torrential rally had an area wanting to get out that we had to go back up\nAnd it takes the cruise you know at least three or four days to get at ... covered again and then it just rained again the other day so the crews are up to this morning as a matter of fact the guys were there this morning I'm On the radio other up their work\nAnd show you know have that and say we know how management works at a clear up there that they are up there today and then of course they're getting everything ready for next week's pilgrimage into force at Seventy ninth annual pilgrimage and Sunday Sunday Sunday next week now this\nYou know I it's it's funny it's like it why would somebody want to put across up there I mean who could come up with this idea just like a let's just put is catching\nWasn't it the pope well it was a it was a call from the Vatican at that time during the depression you know before a Depression era that uh they wanted to\nBring pilgrims close to the Catholic Church again and bring people closer to church and he put out a call for\nThe parishioners and and uh churches around the world to draw people in\nAnd a lot of them decided that they would do monuments if they would do some kind of attraction something to bring\nPeople back together and here locally we had the Colleen of a local a priest that was a sign here to the small town area that had the vision of building this monument up on top of this mountain he was whom a father cost a lot of CEO sta Costa\n... and so that guy's he had division they looked at the back window and said well there's a peak of a huge little interesting little mountain over here why don't we put Jesus up\nLook at what came first thing he did he say yes we are just going to put his stature there we just going to put across or what\nI mean what was the vision division that he has the story goes I mean I get I got the story early on of course grandparents and ... and I'm a third generation volunteer myself along with several of the groups and the the guys that are up there\nBut the story would come as is that uh you know he was a a a parish priest that was sent here from shaft or Texas ... area and he was a sign here and that he had this vision he wanted to build something he wanted to do something\nIn answer to this ... call to to build a monument\nAnd the story was that he was looking out the window of his of his home was was there at a at the churches I Will say oh dude under right there in small towns and he had the vision that he saw this mountain any pictured a monument to Christ up at the top of the mountain so at that point\nHe discussed it with the congregation and of course everybody thought he was crazy about Monica put some kind of mind and I thought last [laughter]\nAnd then they didn't know where the property or who own the property if it was still in the U.S if it was you know but because it was right on the border in Mexico New Mexico they didn't know he was going to do it anyway it wasn't anything that was the that was the idea you know and and he pretty much took it upon himself and\nAnd then further close the budget as everyone knows was very stern very did you know\nHe baptize me and then he passed away right after that I don't know if there was an incident\nIt get white [laughter] you'll get him out to them out from that was that he couldn't take it anymore [laughter]\nBut uh but that was it I was born in sixty five and I think in August uh they baptized me if you are well I think it was ... and October and he pass shortly after that so I never got to meet him other than that\nWell how how big they put it wouldn't class at the house said was that\nThere was a twelve foot wouldn't cross initially and that was taken straight up the mountain and it was built in and you know we we knew that they had built this wouldn't cross but we never knew the history up until a few years ago that I was having lunch with my uncle Tony uncle twenties Ninety six years old\nAnd they only was involved right he was an altar boy he was after boy he was he was there that the time than that if it goes to head this\nThis idea to build this cross and I learned of it having lunch with my dad and uncle Tony sitting at the kitchen table any trend of me says they did I ever tell you the story but that cross and I said no so I flip my phone on and it started recording handle good and he started telling us the story that he was you know they were that they had have masks on a Sunday Morning\nAnd dream Massey told all the gentleman all the all the people in the congregation he told the guys all the men to bring their work clothes next Sunday because they were built for ... so they all brought their work clothes and he had a bunch of lumber stuck back during the behind the church and he went to\nApparently he went back there in and told them this is what I Want and they built the twelve foot wouldn't cross the following Sunday\nThey uh they got together and he told them that we're going to climb up to them and bring your shoveled\nSix and they dug a hole in stuck that cross up there on the top was the first actual recording pilgrimage if they made\nSo that was pretty pretty you know what year this was thirty three thirty mile ... three so that we ... it was it and my uncle Tony says it when they left the church that morning he they had left church method let out after he had told everybody\nAnd he was driving down what was my son will now George Donovan because they were actually he was also doing mass uh up here by Anthony they used to get Houston double up and give mass at that church over there so is there driving down my son when he was pointing at the\nAt the mountain itself and he says up there you go see this I said this where I'm going to put this crossing they thought it was hilarious he says oh these is gone crazy now but here it is you know and and he got his vision you know got got got the idea put into place\nAnd so that was the beginning but it it's turned out to be how would you characterize the monument now how tall is it how big is it\nOh it's it's it's evolved well not evolved against the idea for him evolved over the years because it wasn't necessarily what he wanted he wanted a big one you wanted a big one he wanted something bigger and then he and he enlisted the help of the vocational school there are a small town\nAll the guys were ... the guys worked at smelter town right to them\nRight right and then the students there that we're going to the vocational iron works class he got them together\nAnd give them an idea that to build an iron cross oh now that things are they went up there and they they substituted they wouldn't crush took it down and they plan to the base a cement base and they and they and they built in erected this thirty five foot\nOr iron cross it wasn't like I mean we know about that one oh you know there was in the interim than the can down but it still wasn't what he wanted wanted something bigger and didn't wouldn't cross the pieces end up somewhere you found them or something\nRight that wouldn't cross was found unfortunately that was kinda destroyed at the time but there was and and uh and and that's you know been gone but we had we had located it for a while and then all of sudden disappeared\nAs soon as I said the evolution of the monument at the top ended up with a thirty three foot high how ... how to use it based\nIt's forty six forty six with debate with the base and it's a twelve foot base so you know it's a it's a it's all it's a pretty big monument there\nAnd it's carved blind and maybe not blonde limestone Bud Light limestone\nIts various quarter of an limestone that was sent elected by the ... what's that we're in what kind of a quarter of an ... was that many of his color I guess it's a ... color that's according time they'll be in ... he found that down near Austin, Texas yeah looking around for a while to get some stuff right now the most senior\nCoast or the one that actually reached out to be so useful that which was the Spaniard a sculpture that the sculptor who came from Mexico City he got those telegrams through from a a new disclose stuff out of course there to come to pass so he had a project for them and they had apparently met in Europe somewhere maybe in Spain that they had met before\nAnd uh in in title enlisted him to to come to a Paso to to work on this project in he accepted\nAny live down in the in the canyon area down there right in a small little house for a while\nBehind actually behind the actual mountain itself towards the art of would exist now is already knows yeah in that area there\nWow and I just started Venus wouldn't really cooking it but that early moment that came along with it laid right in the forties very interesting stuff El Paso smell Cristo Rey is a thing although it's in New Mexico\nAnd Texas and why and why is it el\nPaso is now Cristo Rey was built El Paso and so but it was built by the people of smelter town in the surrounding areas around smelter down one of his stuff all over the past so and it was passed when it was people that end and it was owned by the diocese of al Paso\nThe diocese of El Paso looted southern New Mexico corrected that was it was Catholic jurisdiction of El Paso that's correct and that broke up in eighty three and two of the judges have lost cruises was created and so they they took it over and they sort of like don't care about it as much as the guys and smell the exactly\nAnd I don't think there's a connection you know that that there are families worked there that they built this monument with their hands and and the work and effort that went into it so I mean for for New Mexico it's a it's a of course the Catholic trying it's a shrine to somebody in the port us which is their insulin park\nAnd they may be getting rid of the store items if you want one this might be your\nYeah this is the exactly what they've got all this great stuff that you can buy it Christmas is coming and then also October twenty eight that at a eight eight am at the last Sunday hike as can be Halloween hike\nThere or not they got it hike this time it'll be hiking the

national is facing charges of trying to interfere in the\nUpcoming midterm election in the U. S. N. B. C. C. Williams the detail\nOf what the charges say is that for the past several months she's use social media platforms and Internet Web sites to create these false email accounts and other entities all intended to undermine the election\nUm basically what they would have to do is of course they would have to do some actual research and get some you know not just um\nLike word of mouth but try to pin down some a documented fact about the house or whatever it happens to be OK okay but if you have you you have to have something historic out yeah yeah pretty much I mean I'm more like I'm not much as I Love my house\nAnd it could be a store it's it's an old house it's not a historic house it's\nJust all you want a B fall if you'd been ab fall then yes I but I also get the grave you have a problem but I mean mark Mark's out may not be stored although when mark becomes famous someday we'll go back and make it harder for the Texas historical commission\nIf a an event occurred if it's\nA ... fifty years or more it's considered his historic in general\nA ... a topic um it can be historic um if somebody died say within the last\nTen years it can be considered historic as well so those are requirements in the state of Texas their their their guidance guide guidelines so\nIt wasn't just has to be a person staying there suppose your house was the first one that was up\nPoured concrete structure so it has some kind of architectural significance or the first of any of you know a like a myriad of categories well the mills building\nFor example you mentioned poured concrete that building is a in a store yeah or if you're on it\nYes and I think it might be the seconds of of that type of up or concrete\nSo the thing is though is that's that's what makes things stores like the humidity's a prospect ousted punch will be a state I Lived in that that could deserve a monitor or various things could deserve a marker and so what do you have in the works right now what is a marker that you've got going on\nWe had ... okay we have a list that we've been working on a recently and\nUm there there are various categories um we have replacement markers and then we have new markers now the replacement markers some of the replacement ones that are kind of a deteriorated or there's some wording that's not appropriate\nUh today is that was back then when they were first put up are going to be replaced and those a couple of those are the costs are tease\nThe ... then through now there's one on the on the west side or were Keystone is now and one in ... coral both of those are in the works right now his replacement mark\nAnd obviously the coming over ... just recently thanks to Bernie Sargent than and other people got entirely I mean there's science throughout the entire length of it coming through the area ...\nIt was a twelve year old yes over ... you see all of these are gearing Williams in Gary ... so so that I mean the ... just in and of itself\nSo now those markers ... separate from the ones you're talking about yes yes so you're talking about distort markers that are metal the heavy duty that's correct they have a lot of writing on them about the events that you're talking about and then once we just mentioned\nOr the new markers for the ... which is a pretty good size sign with an symbol on yes and something about us or roadside most I rode markets\nAnd or ... or worked developed through the national Park Service okay they had to have final approval from there so that's a separate process altogether from\nThe ones we're talking about the THC get involved in that at all or would you know they may have directly to the part I think they were involved yet but but mostly the Park Service and so you'll see those down down if and drive in wherever it is the commuter rail\nYeah we don't want the real one yes and so now the ones that mark is talking about is we're trying to pull out areas on the ... which is enough itself historical but the different areas that have specific significance than trying to put markers in the sense that we have one that we have scheduled ... Keystone\nAnd then we have one that we have scheduled down in South Dakota right\nNow we know those two points were on the commuter rail absolutely and what in the middle of it there may be appointed to which is not really define because one of the problems was the river moved out or maybe the road moved a little bit as well we have we don't know within ten feet exactly where it went\nBut in some cases we do for example it puppies restaurant absolutely I'm kids you know yeah that was the ... the ... the original concrete road that they poured for the for the what was the highway we'll begin with a B a I was a\nThat high Bankhead bank here today highway went right through that area and so it was the first road they put in concrete\nYou can still find conquer it out and if you extended it through what is now ... building you'd go right through his kitchen allow I think we could put it right in the middle of puppies restaurant I don't think he'd minded blow great interest attraction we go forward is stored Margaret Pepe\nIt'd be a little problematic [laughter]\nBut that's the kind of thing you guys would sort of not admitted ... so ... you get a request from somebody how do you get a request this email you are\nBasically people view I'm pretty much email the um the El Paso county historical commission and it's a little bit complicated because you do have to go on to the passive Kathy website right now I kind of work your way through it or do you have a phone number you want to ...\nUh people can call at three ... three five to six eight to seven to if they have ideas for new marker say that again slower for people who live where I live three zero three or five to six uh-huh eight to seven to I think I got it okay and I if you wish I can talk about the process here\nIs how do you ... okay somebody holds across the whole process of what it's all a mark I would like a marker for something at my house or somewhere nearby that I think it's cool\nOkay so so are they can talk the committee get the ... of the county historical commission can initiate a marker too so this is the process if I'm I'm and I'm quoting a bit from the uh Texas historical commission websites guidance here on this\nUm so the applicant research is a topic and writes a narrative\nThen the applicant would contact the county historical commission in this case the El Paso county historical commission\nAnd the commission forwards the application to the Texas historical commission\nThen the applicant requests um ah the THC excuse me request an application fee and then the THC reviews and scores applications that THE accepts public comments on applications and the applications or approved in January\nThe THC requests marker payments and the applicant sins in the payment\nHow much money will that varies from the markers I'm right now a subject marker which is the most common kind is that they raise the price just for this year or just this year and it's a two thousand two hundred right\nNow for about for the fabrication it's ... dollars for the application so so make the metal things to sort of ground metal thing salt total it's twenty three hundred if you include the ... and that's the one of the large ones that had a large I Know sometimes the county will pay the fee that's that is indeed correct that our where he appropriations or for the initiating a certain\nAmount of markers ourselves also if a person sends over I you know they said just something and we and the commission agree that it has a certain amount of historical significance that is really important to the area we could just run with it in which case we would pay for the entire McKay okay or\nYou might see somebody else pay for it outside entity that some people are extremely proud of their you know their family or or their house or whatever and\nYou know and they have the money to do so it helps out you know but but it always has to go back to the facts ma'am I'm I'm not kidding what what's the what's it you know how they said the market value and watch this I Want to hear that yeah that's what you saw that I start to finish\nThat process that the markers staff and prepares the inscription and inscription sent to the county historical commission and an applicant for review then changes if any are made to the inscription and then once approved by the Paso county historical commission the markers ordered a foundry cash and ships the marker\nAnd then the count historic commission and the other end or the applicant installs a marker then the county historical commission and or the applicant plants marker dedication and that's a big thing will tell you I'm already time or data markers staff enters information on an atlas or there is a Texas atlas for\nAll markers and that's a good thing and there's like two hundred and fifty some odd counties or is it would I oracle commission and every one of those in most of them and everybody's trying to get this to happen\nLike how long is the normal process\nIt really depends um\nFor a subject marker which is the ah has to go through the most amount of you know groups jumping through\nIt actually takes a few years now there are other kinds of markers that we haven't talked about like cemetery markers which are\nSmaller we just had the dedication for one last week which I could talk about that but the Bailey a little rather Bailey yeah there are a little round markers and those don't I mean that when took long overall but those and be say a\nOne to two year process so that was longer though that was like that one was a ... a member of Bernie was a volunteer at the gas ... because they they actually documented as many graves as they could out there\nAnd there were Fifteen hundred yeah so their entire process it was amazing and I I hidden behind building out there I Am really I'm just I'm more of a the ...\nTo thirty PM it's a tour of the pass up in North mural and this is followed by presentation by Dr Melissa
