I think it's ... I think it's their responsibility for both parties\nTo educate their constituents about what's happening in the world yeah absolutely I totally agree with you know do a show to fanned the flames that somehow if you're going to go up there and you're going to get a march for a repeal of the of the electoral college\nWithout someone explaining to them that folks it's not going to happen and here's why it's not going to happen I I\nGo you know we're ... we're talking about the average ... Democrats and the problem is to get back to work\nFrom an hour ago is that the average Democrat has not accepted that Trump won the last I Know I and\nI don't know how big a problem in terms of division I want to hear Peter in terms of bigger fish I first off I I I look at that election as not Donald Trump winning I look at it as Hillary Clinton losing\nOkay the deck was stacked and she failed to actually play the cards that she was dealt in a way like to when she lost the election that's how it is I don't know\nAny democratic voter who still doing over Trump winning even the ones who held their you know who were super Hillary folks the ones who held their nose in voted for they all acknowledge she lost it will it mean whether Russia was involved or not she lost by more hasn't put anything out to make us think otherwise you know the day the message that you said it needs to be\nImpressed upon every voter and anyone who's undecided are out there just remember elections have consequences yes absolutely simple real with your hundred percent or whether you're a Republican or Democrat and I hope you know if you're undecided you're a Democrat um keep that in mind your vote\n... no vote is trivial every boat has an input you go and we watch later\nYou're but you've got to explain to your to your constituents when the election is over\nYou'll look your ... your fight harder you run a better campaign with better Kennedy's the next time and that's all you may change you can't just say okay Donald Trump elected you know was elected president but like for college and by the way he's going to make appointments to the Supreme Court and then you've got people half the people who may be Democrats they're saying well\nWhy does he get a chance to make that point I may not heard anybody say that route you know look Merrick Garland was put forward and what that's a different story but there's been an attempt to de legitimize this president from the day he\nWas elected president ... ... and a half hour days yeah and you know nothing but it's been one thing after another like Russia somehow influenced the election in ... it's one of ... after a ... we know Russia was involved I mean that's that's a fact that every intelligence agency is has agreed upon that they didn't change one vote your\nLeader now do you believe you're a cyber security guy do you believe that Russia and China as the president has alleged are both involved in this campaign I Am beyond a shadow of a doubt certain they are they on your your how are we generally attempting\nI mean a cyber espionage um if you're a sophisticated country with a lot of resources like China is on China has launched\nA cyber attacks um one actually out in Nineteen or I think Eighteen or Nineteen Chinese spies who were summarily executed so we know they have the means you know they have the ability um Russia we ever all of our intelligence agencies have agreed has done so um and they want to impact the upcoming election and\nThis and is doing so it is doing so I mean there will be the next ... we want to have you back on before before the elections but I guess I Want to come back we'll focus most of the show on the charges that you just made their very serious there's something no matter what your politics are I think you want to know that your vote doesn't count to just important

going on but questions because you'd be happy information you might not necessarily get the mindset the performers asking for rights and so you have the people that are slanted I mean it's really important that even if you're not you know a student or a parent attached to pedal hills high school you can still come to that if I'm correct\nThat's correct and that's what we also do a show with our students um some of our students may not be able to attend the event but as long as that there'll be other\nFast the night that the other high schools even outside our district and so we're we're very fortunate that I think our city or chamber um our community has come together to really get that information to our our our families so that our our students can go ahead and I know do what they need to do so they can have that ... ... secondary success\nRight so what are some of the the most common questions that come up during these events what are some of the the kind of sticking points that people run into as they're trying to get through this and if they really need the help on\nI think one of the things that I see a lot is that is prior to let your fast so there's a thing called an ...\nEssay id and that's something that you need to apply for\n'em in order to um because when you're doing it passed but it it the SATs almost like an ... an identification number for you\nI'm so people get confused with that and um it's real simple process and also you can go on on the website to the government website and apply for it ahead of time so that when you go to pass the night you're not there having to figure that out at that moment\nSo I really encourage the ... the parents and the high school students to talk to their ... because they have all the information in terms of making it easier for them you know\nAnd that's actually what we've done a couple of hills um our counters went ahead and we used a meeting with our students and\nBut I didn't that website and that time in the school day to go ahead and apply for their fast I said it's a it's a process where you go on line and you submit your\nYour information um and your Social Security number and you just submit that to the government and in a federal government comes back with an email with your um identification code\nSo that would be your way to sign your document um of course now I'm everything's on line as far as the applications concern and the parents would have to do the same thing so we can help our students um either with us it in a campus and but parents when you also have their own essay ID\nSo there's a lot of ground work to then coming to the apps and that a lot of stuff that needs to be done ahead of time that is unheard of you if you do it but if you try to do it all at once can be a little overwhelming yeah but this is true threat is that what what was the biggest misconception people have about the whole process\nI think one thing that I hear a lot is that well a financial ... for instance if your family if you think you make us over the certain amount of money you feel like you shouldn't apply because what for my child her daughter is not going to get any money so I'm not going to apply we've all\nHad this misconception of that and they also have the misconception of immigration status it'd be really afraid to fill it out because of the immigration status but there are so many different alternatives for that that people aren't aware of and that's why it's important to come and just ask the question because I think a lot of times people are afraid or they just don't know\nSo they just decide not to do it it's always better to ask the question and and you'll see that potentially you'll come out ahead of that exactly\nThat I'm particularly right particularly since I mean this absolute self again pretty much all financial aid I'm ready to begin with come not even from the federal doesn't believe in the state level ... often gets routed through this form out is right and\nThat's exactly right and and we always encourage students as we speak to them that um the FAFSA is you know this whole um huge a piece of information that if as long as they get that application in there that can be eligible for all these types of aid it's not just the grants and so I'm an over the free money so yes\nSo it's very important and again that fascinate series is happening now through November aid at a fifty plus high schools throughout our region that again October Eighteenth is the one for pedal hills but again you can go to anyone anywhere in our area we're talking with Diane in Rico had counseled for pedal hills high school and college Lopez manager of coaching for all Paso chamber of commerce\nThat goes very much for talking to us about this thank you and your if we said at the website to find the information on this little Paso dot org slash FAFSA dashing nights that's S. A.\nS. S. A. dash nights you're listening to build Paso public former host editor book\n[noise]\nBack to another edition of your past a public forum on your host ended ... er during this time around by careless words communications manager for the wind WC El Paso and when Sosa vice president for all possible but for to talk about the walk a mile in her shoes are coming up over much joining us and looking at you\nSo brutal may have no idea what is walk a mile in her shoes\nFor a walk on my own her shoes it's a crowd funded\nFundraiser so gentle managed sign up register and they crowd fund from their friends family colleagues\nTo reach their own personal going to help the YWCA reach our goal and then they wear the rent high heels and walk less my cynical mile for anybody who's curious it but none of it's not a mile\nA symbolic mile in rent high heels to support YWCA Sarah McKnight transitional living center which is where we serve women and children who are experiencing homelessness mainly due to some form of family or domestic violence\nGotcha so the event is both a fundraiser to customers in competition as well and the on your website or what do we feel Paso dot org you guys have kind of current ... so that donation about right so it's not even just competition it's active competition right\nYeah so we like to say that it's really funny then there's competition between participants between teams\nAnd then of course you get to wear red high heels and walk around and have a great time and then we have an after party hosted by aunts and eleven in downtown El Paso so a lot of fun but it's important to remember that it's very very serious cause to raise awareness of domestic violence and to raise funds to support those who have survived\nAn experience that might not be women or their children as well at our transitional leaning center\nRight and then uh Wayne a with a oh Paso electric you guys probably have one of the top teams and one of the end you're one of the top donor getters yourself\nYeah so we want to thank America our CEO and they'll pass electric de do totally support this program and the YWCA\nAnd being a big sponsor of this of at 'em and then together our team or believes in this event uh we understand the ... the reason that we're doing this and why we're standing up for this awareness for finally violence for these women and children that are houses transitional living center\nAnd so that gives us an opportunity to where we are more fortunate than them to help them out and and it and to give back to the community to these women and children\nAnd so I understand that you all the the team bill passed other team had a chance to to visit the the transitional living center\nWe did we were given the opportunity to take a tour of the center\nAnd I will tell you Andrew that are really open to the eyes of the hearts of our of our guys where we came to see what we're doing what the purpose of this was and we we got to meet some of the women and the children at the center and see the facility\nUm which were you know again gives them can be secure in safe um but at the same time I'm there need as many things and um we we hope that this will help them\nContinue to prosper and get back on their feet and get back on the community with jobs but at the center is is a well secured and uh they do provide the women a lot of opportunities to um be educated get some self esteem self respect back\nUm and they have a lot of programs for those women and their children\nBut during the tourism anything in particular that that really affected your that really stood out to you\nI think the one thing I when we first got there um we were given the kind of a general tour and we met a man a mom or two but when we saw the children returning from school\nAnd to see the children in in how happy they were to be at the center\nUh that was a big impact me I'm used to small children not knowing really what's going on in their lives but to know that they're they're with their mother and that's something he just has that impacted me and to see the conditions are you know that they're that they're in it was the safest secure but at the same time\nUm it it's it's an interim basis kind of thing for them so the children had the biggest impact to me\nThe children and their reaction miles so how long is this have been been been going on and off ... so\nThis is our nine year alone is event so it's it's grown every year and we're really hoping to make an even bigger impact that here we have a goal of a hundred thousand dollars to read well and we are at about eighty so we're pretty close and that's there still time to for people to register to\nAnd if you're a woman it's an event for men but of course if you want to support you can encourage the guys in your life to register or you can just go on and support either that\nEven in general or somebody that you know that's participating or if you find we have a team like Wayne's team we have I'll pass logic but we have teams from all sorts of organizations we have a team called the mighty little boys just ended up a fifth graders from Mississippi that who find her just to pay\nOn their own and that's something that they have decided to take on that you could support that team but any amount helps us reached that goal and\nLike we were saying it's it's\nReally impossible to understand that\nAre are\nThe women are centered go through so much before they get to us and then when they're there\nWe try to help them with things like childcare case management life skills classes things that if you're an abusive relationship you maybe never had a bank account in your own name you never knew how to write a check maybe you didn't have a job you never all sorts of different things that\nAre not the case for everybody there but for a lot of lot of our limited is the case and things that are just second nature to a lot of people you know opening a bank account writing a check a house\nIt's really supposed to be everything they learn is supposed to be to help them move to self sustainability to help them move to something permanent for themselves not all the women there have children so for themselves or for their families to make life the best for them\nAnd to move on in their life to get past this really terrible chapter or whatever they just experienced so\nLike I said it's a really it is a fun of it and we have a lot of fun\nIt's a lot of falling on it but a very very\nVery very certainly it's one way that we you know why did we see our mission is to\nEmpower women it's part of our mission and this is a really great way for men to engage with that mission and to help the YWCA achieve that mission in ways that maybe we have something called the women's engine in April on they're not really interested in that because it's called the women's luncheon but this is mathematically for men and women can actually support them men in this endeavor so\nOctober Eighteen to wear their registration is open or why did you see a El Paso dot org you can register onsite starting out for will be there the ... fix the after parties afterwards where will you I'm some competition will award a those who did the high fund raising the team with the highest fund raising the\nIndividual that had the highest fundraising and it's just really I mean we just have a lot of fun so\nI Hope more people will join us this is a like I said it's our ninth year so now you know and then going on a decade next year twenty Nineteen so hopefully everybody can come out and like Wayne was talking about it's it's really impossible to hear those stories are from people who have been through unimaginable things with their families\nNow so um yeah so the work the fundraising all of that is of course very important but then of course the the walking on my own her she was the actual physical actors who can help raise awareness I guess ... for you what do you feel what do you hope or would you tell people to get out of this when they see you know yourself doing this kind of a\nWell you know I I reach out to family and friends and and uh the first thing they think about that he wants to me a picture of us read high heeled shoes\nAnd so uh you know it is fun and it does generate some interest in that alone to see the guys are in ... and we did some photo shoots with ah our team in our in our ah and our safety shirts in our heart hat to the past electric in front of our power plant we are narrowing you'll choose and are crazy socks\nSo you know it is a fun event but I think what we can lose focus on his ... and I've been stressing and that is for these women and children\nBut um yeah for two courage my family and friends if they just want to see a picture of obviously I provide that to them hopefully that'll show that too much but uh it is I Will tell you Andrew a ... yeah I appreciate and ah ... women who have to walk and I used to work every day\nIt is it is a challenge um but you know it into Dave's actually we have to do to to get this to raise the money\nI'm all for it so um yeah it's quite a bit to come out in the hundreds of men walking around the the plaza in red high heeled shoes and hopefully no one is a far falling or spring unethical that's quite a quite a feat cars are higher up than there used to live and I\nTo rent it though like I said oh gotcha Ronnie and I'm like I Can't get out and we don't it's not a race but they they've been doing it from the beginning and then they challenge themselves and they're just they're gone oh\nJeez well hopefully they will hurt themselves but again that's coming up walk them out in her shoes on October each team for information was the why do we see El Paso dot org
