good stuff\nObviously yes the bottom line what is it all about we are big brothers big sisters and we are a nonprofit youth mentoring organization\nAll money raised at ... at dance for kids safe stays local to support the services we provide El Paso children and how our program works is we\nFind volunteer adult mentors we screen them we train them we um prep them and we matched them appropriately and compatibility with\nThe children in our program and these kids range in age from six to Seventeen years old and if they come from all different backgrounds all walks of life\nOr some of them may be dealing with bullying or maybe they've got a parent that's deployed or maybe they had a parent that's passed away and um sometimes they're just struggling in school are struggling at home with their family and\nFor whatever reason they just\nWant and need someone in their life to talk to about school or peer pressure or their hopes and dreams or their worries and their concerns or what's going on in their life\nAnd that's where our mentors step in and serve as an amazing resource for them is sounding board a support role model [noise] um and they get together a couple of times a month and we provide ongoing case management and support for them\nUm that we provide lots of opportunities for fun events and activities in the community months leave for the participants to participate in for free [noise] um and so it it's amazing what a difference it makes in these children's lives they\nAs a result of this very simple friendship and uh they do better in school they are less likely to get involved with gangs and drugs and alcohol and delinquent behavior of any kind they are more likely to graduate to go to college to have higher household incomes as they grow up [noise]\nUm the the impact of mentoring not only impacts them right then and there as a child but it has a ripple effects throughout the entire community that this child now is a part of and for the rest of that child's life they will see the positive impact of having a mentor when they were a child\nWhile so it's a lot of area packing up and so I mean ... reports support through the organizations those other free events going on all that kind of ...\nYes and you know what we are also really excited about wanting to promote right now we are in the middle of a big one hundred challenge and that is to bring one hundred mentors in one hundred days\nBecause we have a whole lot of kids on our waiting list well over one hundred children on our waiting list and we just have to get out there to read the word that there is this need and that it's not a hard thing to do you\nYou step up you get together with the child a minimum of twice a month you have to be twenty or older um and you do of course pass a background check and come to an orientation an interview so we can get to know you [noise] um\nBut beyond that you become this amazing friend support role model mentor toward to this child and\nYou know we have this new new campaign going and it's all about defending the potential of\nYouth of ... and so all of our mentors are now defenders of potential and that is literally an accurate statement because these children they have all the potential in the world they just need someone to help cultivate it and inspire it to come out and so\nOne hundred mentors and one hundred days is our goals we started October first and we are well on our way we want all of the El Paso community to spread the word step up if you can share it with your friends if you can't um\nAnd text be big to five five five eight eight eight for more information\n... I mean with the impact that you mentioned just the commitment of just two two times a month is what can the prospect\nAbsolutely it really does it does not take a whole lot to make an impact you don't

those years and my little sister was awesome she started out at about shoulder height to me and she [laughter]\nI was looking up to her by the end of it and she did end up aging out of the program she is a grown up now um but she I remember going and watching her and her volleyball games than just supporting her and the things that she was passionate about\nAnd that's that's all it was about it was so simple and so fun to to share some of life's experiences with her and I hope that I made you know an impact on her I Know\nStatistically that enters in general do I hope that I also made that empowered of worker fixture\nYes with um [laughter] ... for big brothers big sisters it'll pass will be dance for kids sick of and and farmers are coming up it's November third\nAh doors open that six the show circus and be able to find more information go to BBS ... dot org or look up their brothers and sisters all Paso on Facebook we've been talking with Rebecca remote will develop a drug or for big brothers big sisters they very much for coming in talking to us about older things going on\nThank you so much for the opportunity we are always so happy to spread the word [noise]\nUm recently and we have one in the spring and in the fall generally\nAnd on those days if you don't truly need expedite service you can come directly to the agency what it does save a little time in between mailing the passport that type of\nThing and it being officially received kind of right mhm so you have the kind of extra there'd be expedite fee that I might want to call the stupid fever having waited too long ago of course there are legitimate circumstance which could be late but most people it's because they they waited too long and they made poor decisions\nBut so that's the the basic for you how much is the passport itself\nThe passport for an adult first time applicant as a hundred and forty five dollars and the card which is used very frequently along the border sixty five dollars now the difference between the book in the car does the book you can use for all types of travel you need the book to fly on an international flight\nThe card you can use to travel from Mexico back into the United states from Canada back in the states and on some closed loop cruise is in the Caribbean\nUm you want to check with the cruise line make sure that line\nThey can tell you whether or not you need the book or the cart so in general just know that you know the car does not have wings and you need to get on an international flight the Carter still part of identity and citizenship but it was meant as a less expensive alternative to those living along the U.S Mexico and us Canadian border\nFor commuter space it right and so I mean we have lots of people in this community who who get that but I'm as I'm sure there where it's basically land borders of the U.S getting back in and some boats but you really have to check right\nDon't grow up so all this stuff all this information um again that website that people can visit to find out more information is travel dot ... dot Gov and then also include one of the local events are up there'll be there as well right\nRight if you want to look at passport days I'm ... different agencies have them at different times during the year so you know you may\nYou'll find that information there for example um you're looking for one for maybe a student that maybe is going to school out of state they may they can look there to to find that if they're going to study abroad that kind of thing they should be thinking about getting our passport sooner rather than like\nAgain and now is a great time because it's a low demand part of the season and things can just have a faster again as long as you have your information together and that was the time to figure it out and these are going to again for ten years so it's a I'm sure it makes you always was a little bit easier as well as people would spread it out a little bit\nRight and if they apply early it's great for them too because then they can you know trouble shoot 'em in time and not you know they're taking a trip next week and they suddenly realized oh I Need a passport\nAnd then they're scrambling to get everything together I mean you just do it in plenty of time it's not I'm the same as maybe just\nI don't know I think people don't really think about how much is involved I mean this is your citizenship an identity document so we really do make sure that you're entitled to ... that document\nAnd that you are who you say you are and sometimes that takes a little bit of time and more than you know you would think I mean it takes a little I mean how long does it take to get a driver's license nowadays\nThat's it it's it's a bit though while\nIt can be complicated there but this is the most complicated plus B bribery laws of any standard id anyone's going to hold much should be some of the thing about more often than that [noise]\nSo ... so that when we apply earlier playoff did apply now because again good for ten years and now is the good season we've been talking with Jennifer ... customer service manager reveal Paso passport agency talking about the really great time to apply right now for your passport because it is the oil in the season\nRight and you know you can always find more information at our website at the travel that
