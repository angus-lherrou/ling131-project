were shot and you're the jaguars stadium\nAnd we have two more groups coming next year but um you know the first product is a smart security like which is actually a poor choice of taking being stolen any of your doors um you know front door backdoor site or\nIn the ... as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with the new fixture you just use existing wiring that's already there yeah no additional wires yeah it was all everything else has wireless so to basically get to ten or Fifteen minutes a project after you turn off the record by the way so\nGood point very good very good so you turn off to brag are literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm you know the nice thing\nWe'll diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide in\nBlack wearing a black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely and he downloaded the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy\nProcess okay so seriously it is that easy I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Soviet the old flood light you can just simply ...\nYes if you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the played up you're not actually holding the light in your head it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really has a lot like the maximum flood light is easier to mail that a flood light you buy the big Barcelona he really is because of the quick ... am absolutely who really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter\nUm you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification at someone's at your door so I'm at work do you get alert I'm\nIn the ... in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes a sound or ...\nWhatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise would however you set it up and your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive\nAnd you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar I mean you could as alarm that can be\nPress so if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answered the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded as to the cloud for per download and viewing later\nSo so if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter]\nYou can see if there's kids coming out and see a lot ... usually not every child likes our products to [laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years so this coach light with camera or are these\nPrevalent or you were the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you know search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the force that does come in different um different styles indifferent finishes 'cause we try to accommodate you know the delights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know is it really support sites we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nIn our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality of the camera detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera\nIt's a hundred and two hundred Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but\nBecause of our application and our software and the from where the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource um heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals so am really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day in time\nUm it's just it's again there's so many uh features in our app that customers really like and we we hear that you know quite often\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of ...\nTo ... yeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the flood lights and the coach later the other a porch lights\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed the product\nYou want to aim that cameras or you get the optimal um field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a lock and rainy and lock that camera into place and then and typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the live feed or you're watching a video later you can ... you can actually ... so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if using them in with the pension is great great\nSo I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines if someone has a question about the maximus lighting or

with maximus lighting and we've been talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates LED lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds before before what before you see the\nRight so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and we were in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed so if a if\nA driver or FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package

right away super\nAll right let's get to the phones and if you have a question about this feel free to jump on board again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five in Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I just had a question for the cattle and talking about ... what the camera uh-huh now what happens if somebody perfectly comes out there in damages that covers it is that possible for them to cover it so they can't do anything\nWell sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten seconds buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get to the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors but the blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question no die and you're thinking\nThere's not alarm goes off on your phone it how many were actually not a light off the wall fake so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart in order to where you're already said hundred eight to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI uh I have a question we shoot the runaround what trick or treaters\n... yes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights is the on your front door um I mean that's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet mean your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she couldn't do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um\nYou want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any\nOf your life you know turned off every ten minutes though the turn of the house and go wandering if there's a way to the jets offense\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control ... literally we just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera\nAnd you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera and beyond that you can actually turn to the bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once installed a product you can kind of tune\nWhich alerts you want to get the ones that matter and again we've built all that features into the product in the apple very cool and then\nSee that's man you got to think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five or Sheila welcome [noise]\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or any how Kyl's or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I\nDon't I mean I don't think of the show\nOkay well ... actually today\nMarks ready to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home\nNo matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone and it says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either their wife eyes out okay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power this time we get that question it's something that\nI'm interested but we don't we just pointed does need power to operate\nInterested you yeah all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful oh All right um I just fell apart\nYou can pick out a podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solve it online dot com but one of the questions I have for you is we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also is and again did they have any video of this happening at all\nNo yeah\nBut I'm the max and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting\nThat wouldn't be a problem though right we're going to we're going to one of the videos is to send up to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we ... we both add on to the front of the video\nSo you would get the person coming up to the door\nAnd see them in the video before they they damaged let's keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture it's not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right is it actually it is to a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what's there yeah it looks like a ... coach late would know the cameras there unless you're really looking forward\nTo but if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome\n... were catch a don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nI second up on that answer possibility that the way we do I make sure possibly go buildings hold on a device where you can\nHave watched the first stole a car and insurance tying health or the security mile vehicle to\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I have at the first time I've heard that question it's a good\nWell that's a great college that one day [laughter] yeah sure [laughter] yeah but in the Google it certainly could be ... up their litter sure\nI'm In\nLove at great thank you very good thanks angel appreciate it and again these are\nAvailable at Costco it's available at home depot smart listeners I'm telling you what\nRight there and there were actually the promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every store willows lows carries I Believe in five or six hundred stores okay I'll take care of the product to so okay can they order online course yet if you Google the maximus smart security ... light you'll find all the different the coverage platforms that\nYou can buy the product okay I think I Know the answer to this one Andy welcome\nHey my question was you touched on our lights earlier but as far as our in the camera I got a ... actually just hit the light switch as I'm walking out the door am I going to lose the functionality of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that so that the camera can not be turned off I mean you get an education at the ... the cameras off line\nBut um we recommend that you actually eliminate to switch so that the powers never uh never turned off and then just programming is on your apt to do whatever you want to get in and you can turn the alerts off\nToo so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off you know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure but we recommend the optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off\nRight All right very good thank you up by the way we got one line open and we got just a few more minutes with mark if you want to grab it real quick it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five eight ... two three eight to five five um we're just going\nI mean I'm sitting here I Know it I've been stalled it um door bells\nAbsolutely yeah so you know the products that we've have in the market or so just wildly are performing in customers are just you know there's just so impressed with the products and it's really improve the the quality of their lives the convenience of the ... of of having the the cameras and knowing

Jaguars T I Am a bank feel\nResponding officers found five people shot at the scene or transport the local hospitals fire rescue paramedics\nRight again it's eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five we'll get to Jim Jim welcome\nYes there\nAre good morning here um I had an eight hundred and eighty five dollar electric bill on my own\nThree months ago holy taught by a hundred and twenty five followed by seven hundred and fifty that started analyzing everything from the pope to the bases and so forth and the south in South Carolina so it was All right ah shutting\nCoverage um several things um [noise] the house was encapsulated\nAnd they put to a good size humidifiers underneath that it was about three thousand square\nFeet on that for uh-huh and when I was analyzing shutting everything down isolated\n... fires or they were using the equivalent\nOf a hundred and thirty three dollars a month well and my\nQuestion we could go further into it if if you please but my real question is simple and easy is the ... suckers twenty four seven because I'm\nA ... if you don't you know I can cut a\nHundred dollars probably why they are and then on my pool pop I can go to\nYour right right well that's great question a demon of fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even a little tiny portable ones\nWas misled I was told when about pest control company\nWhen it was done that it would have your house so playing you know underneath and it is you know it died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy yourself\nAnd you know but um I was\nTold that the money saved from that and sledding factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so one is running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot at my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little ... or\n... even in areas like from one side to the other you know how they said today humidifiers a ... is the extremity on the kitchen side I'm a little higher mixture extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the ... the percentages I mean is it below fifty is above fifty or\nIt's below fifty book I'm a I've had some pushing and how much of this because uh even though I'm a figures guy the humidity humidity is not what am I right things but uh I think I've heard figures in the thirties or around forty\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern is underneath the house a that was mode and every time we had the rabbit treated\nRight well and it was probably run in Seventy percent them\nAnd and so once it was treated the um the humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally ... so you have them and they did all that water vapor\nWhere you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal right right and I know exactly how much ... joined I really ha negotiate if you work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those ... fires all the time they\nCould possibly maybe once a month a run him for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity as you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do just\nTotally locked and you know yeah I mean his hair free all your van shipping closed off and everything\nRight so what I Would do is I Would go and I would buy a little um like weather station it's about the size of a book you\nCan put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want and then the sensor you just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is is there a you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house now home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know Eighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOh it's way too low yeah you'll never needed that low\nYeah well I was told by another pass guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted it fifty percent okay in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and the weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows sure sure\nAnd then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden that humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive down to maybe I don't know forty five percent questionnaire\nUnless I'm abusing your time or\nThe pope puppets of a it's a um one and a half horse and that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right and I was told by ... or ... that once the temperature of the water hits sixty five and below\nChemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nWell that may be I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense it's it's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why the bumped going\nJim we got to go but monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you got to remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nThink it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside you got a big cold front coming through Florence\nWhen it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate I'm at that point then monitor where your humanity level is All right

them\nWe can kinda rejuvenate them you hear me talk\nAbout a program called ... and we have Chris with us from mill think Chris welcome that almost scary Sullivan warning Gary how you doing I'm doing great how about you not too bad\nThere you go so you heard the stage kitchen cabinets I don't know round the handles probably most people's ah unless\nThey're always using Vilsack you're probably going to find that a black grimy oily substance around the handles of cabinets or even on the doors of kid myths and tell us a little bit about ... got a long history\n[noise] yes you're most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm Zoltan ... he was a master cabinet maker and you know productive is fun creations and that's when most like furniture polish and cleaner was developed\nAnd really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish it'll take that Greece and grime off those kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural luster like you said especially on the handle you're called gang you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors you get that build up in most ethical clean right down to the finish\nSo that grime we have is that cooking oil or what is that grime or a combination of several things I guess ...\nExactly it's a combination that's from ... from the oils in your hand on the Greece's you're cooking on and not all gets on to the cabinet and you don't have using other uh you know use the ... other products you have to clean 'em and then go back and Paul ... or ... you know clean and polish almost up\nNow when you use use the word polish I I Know people use different spray cleaners different spray wax is to give them a little luster but even that wax over time get soft and grimy correct\nRight you if you ... over the years you get that build up where you can almost scrape of where you're from there yeah yeah most that doesn't have any ... in fact most sick remove all that ... built up and clean right down to the finish show on your dining room table you get a heat ring\nThat white ... from the wax built up someone such hot cat on there and I kind of military whack so since most Sacramento's wax built up it'll take that heat ring right off the dining room table watering knocked the coffee table\nAnd it will certainly have a lot of those calls and the next two months I guarantee you so uh so the ... there is no whack sitting there in yet it cleans what what's the secret sauce and you can't tell me the secret to the you know I mean it it's going to be something special is of the silicone or no silk ...\nBuilt up as well right on your furniture and art art or furniture polish doesn't have any water in it it's pure cleaning and portion ingredients in their trade secret ingredients in house formulated and allows our product to do what it does\n[noise] so anything that would about laminate because ... cabinets and stuff like that they get grimy to work on it\nRight laminate painted cabinets um it's even good on your hardwood floors in laminate force you got to lose their directions on a bottle yeah they looted quarter cup a gallon of warm water you'd be amazed by the ... that lists and the shine it leaves behind\nNow does it have to be diluted for the cabinets are just like the floors just for for\nJust for the floors otherwise you use it straight and I guess you just put a little bit on it and Ronald Reagan is\nYeah you just actually slightly dampen your towel and then at the mill sector the towel that activates the [noise]\nThe cleaning agent in our products cleaning ... at the same time sure even came to watch you know we had to hurricanes down south or using candles that candle wax gets on the dining room table or any which surface ...

New York and New Jersey\nSo uh it's world we live and\nI'm sure eventually to work its way out but uh you know yes\nYes nothing nothing they can say about that [noise] All right against the eight hundred eight two three eight to five five a Janelle also posted a question on her Facebook page and it says hey Gary heard you talk about this someone about\nGive it to her holes in a driveway from ... is the word it some in the surface of the concrete just pops up holes are about a quarter inch deep\nAnywhere from two inches to four inches in diameter and um the product you used for that she wants to know what to use for that what you do is you will remove any of the residue from the spoiled area\nYou would remove any dust from the spoiled area then when then you would come back and you would wet that area down you use a hose you need to use the pressure washer you just want that hydrated\nAnd you wanted as clean as you can get it then the patching material is a quick creep ... product is called vinyl\nConcrete catcher and Daniel I um I don't know if you're writing it back to him but we might want to do that to a violent is vital concrete patch or and that can be applied up to a half inch in thickness it's a powder you mix with water\nAnd uh you let sit for about five minutes and it's a it's not a slurry it's a patch it's almost like butter in a tub at that point and you can use a trial you could use a wide taping knife and literally just go around\nAnd just move over those spoiled marks on the driveway\nOr the negative of that of course is no concrete matches one concrete from the neck so if you have a very gray concrete\nUh this might be a little lighter than that if you have your from the south and you've got a little reddish concrete this is a little more of the great side than they do so tense if you've got a lot of it\nAnd of course there's also products that re surface the entire surface of the concrete\nSo that might be something to but the name of the product is vital concrete patch or\nYou can find it and most any hardware store or big box store\nOr write to again to get a question on board simply Dallas up at eight hundred eight two three eight to five five or the Facebook pages Gary solving public ... then you know he's got all kinds of things to do now [laughter] you like in your job today [laughter]\nSo um yeah [laughter] ... you can't say because it gets taken off the air [laughter] so a year\nSo you could also go like I said our Facebook page Gary self and public figure and a poster questionnaire and we can get that answered also given the number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five it sounds a little bumpy it's the first time we've tried it and so I wanted to give it a whirl and see if that's something\nTo make our show a little bit easier to handle for you as you a\nTravel around on the on the weekend so I wanted to pass that along a again that ... sale is going on that goes through Monday\nAnd uh we do have podcast on our website scary Sullivan online dot com or we're talking about the chimney and I hit a chimney sweep on a yesterday and I asked him if he has backed up all the way to Thanksgiving I think he can said close\nSo when I can kind of Star Wars ... in August ... encourage you may be to do something in terms of getting the chimney inspected um that's really the best time to do it right now every chimneys sweep a that is worth to solve is busy\nAnd there is an association if you're going to call someone to inspect your Jimmy it's a C. S. I. a certified chimneys sweep and a lot of cases are almost all those guys have cameras where they can literally inspect the inside party or to me if there's a problem they can show it to you\nAnd I think that's really important\nThat they can actually show it to you\nSo uh anyway\nThat something if if you didn't get your Jimmy inspected and I know you may have to wait a little bit but I Would definitely get on their list right again ah well Mark's got a question mark\nWelcome or a comment hello hey Gary how you doing today doing good sir I just want to let you know I ordered that ... that

color a moment to go talk about all these I O T devices Internet of things devices that can be an act\nAnd according to the IT professional though I work with a fellow says that um what most people neglect to do this is why the devices so ... is they forget to go in and change the the fault password on these devices and oftentimes\nThe default password might be a string of numbers like one two three four five six\nOh that's really easy to hack so you want to\nDo whether it's a baby monitor or it's this lighting system\nAny of these Internet connected devices you know get into the instructions there and look for where\nThe password set is and go in and change the password come up with something unique\nYou know only new rules about passwords Rosina combinations of letters and numbers your\nAnd character signs and and that should\nMake it more robust and I guess the other thing you want to do too as well as is most of these companies will ask you if you want to be on an
