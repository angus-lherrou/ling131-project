slowly disappear and I say slowly because you might walk out three days and that's going on my walk out after three weeks and say nothing going on you're probably see it lighten the little one day you'll walk out to be gone\nAnd I know it sounds crazy but um I get all kinds of calls and emails about uh how wonderful it is and I also get some calls were appeared on three weeks ago Gary nothing's happening and it give it some time but there's three ways that the the one is the concentrate at spoke of the other is they've got a\nI don't know if it's a quarter half gallon or somewhere in between but it's already do use bottle with a little sprayer\nUm and so that's available\nThen there is also one\nIs that is a different formulation that you just connect to host to the hose and spray bottle\nAnd you just have added it the the bottle itself and the mechanism minute actually dilutes the product it'll do I think twenty two hundred twenty four hundred square feet and that spray all go

five hundred dollar repair a fifty dollar repair it'll definitely ... so what are we looking\nWe're we're looking for cracks where the door meets the frame little gap\nAnd if you can get somebody outside at night with a piece of chalk and you're on the inside and you get a little Penn like flashlight just go around with the dorm meets the friend the person on the outside that they see any light penetration they can take that little piece of chalk and just a you know put a little marking on the frame itself\nAnd that's where the leak is you might want to take a look then it changing out the weather stripping and there's all kinds of weather stripping so we can choose from something as simple as a a foam within a nice of on the back it's not going to last year very low but certainly take care of the problem this year there's also an E. D. P. rubber\nA which is much more durable which is a stick on also and then there's some with frames that are more substantial with all vinyl bowl and the woman I'm frame that's the direction I Would go also the joint between the frame and the exterior in the interior walls might take a look it\nMay be putting some uh ... and they're the one thing I don't want you to do is don't concentrate on ... the bottom of that frame\nAnd a lot of cases if the openings or at the top or the sides and you know wind driven rain and water gets in be fined that frame if you see or clock the bottom that water can escape\nAnd then we hold that water in and that's why you see so many door frames that first a bottom twelve inches that wood frame is just totally rotted\nBecause we've trapped that water in there so you know the clock and can be done on the sides that could be done on the top but not at the bottom also take a look at the bottom of the door at the threshold there's a couple of things there that are creating a seal\nThere's the threshold which is wood or aluminum and we'll have either a piece of metal in the threshold or again a vinyl insert a little vinyl ball but\nWhen the door closes it can presses that and creates the seal also in the bottom of some doors they're all different they're all different all manufacturers do differently there's\nEven a some doors at the bottom of the door to part you can't even really see that the sits on top of the threshold there may be some channeling in there where there's a vinyl inserts there and that's how that seals made but again check it\nBecause those vinyl bulbs and a vinyl slash they wear out and it doesn't take long for in the world either\nAnd all that cases you're in business there's\nThere's um obviously if you have an issue with it and the parts broke and uh you got to get the part and there's a lot of window parts companies out there and you can also look on line I mean they'll have six and seven million ... million with an M but um at least you can still find parts\nFor a lot of the western window up in the northern Ohio areas one\nAnd uh there's many throughout the country really but um meet that fell to show all the dime tells me is infant Tori is in the seven million range so uh\nTake pictures trade pictures order them online um any gaps or flaws in the construction around the frame\nUm can be cocked again always be careful of clocking any piece of wood down at the base a lot of times you gotta let that water Cape and talking at the bottom really can cause bigger problems um weather stripping on some of the\nA ventilator double hung windows can be replaced\nAgain knowing the type of knowing the configuration of the channel a will be key but those\nWeather stripping parts can be replaced\nAnd it is just like weather stripping a door and a lot of cases just sliding it in to the channel so those are a couple of things you really want to take a look at it before it gets too uh too cold out cleaning windows [laughter] and I know they just lost a lot of people they don't do windows but really cleaning windows\nOr extend the life of a window remember window glass is a liquid\nYes it's a liquid\nYou look at really really old glass eighty Ninety a hundred years old you ever knows how it's wavy\nAnd it's a liquid but a glass um needs to be cleaned it can get a little pits in it I'm\nIn one of the best products to for cleaning glass that I've come across is the jaws glass cleaner or J. ws I Know kroger's carries it and a lot of parts of the country now you can also get it in on line at the jaws cleans dot com\nBut I Would highly recommend that in fact it's a ph neutral there's no silicone or alcohol in that\nAnd what that means is you can use it on a glass like um high def TV screens computer screens getting and use it on your eyeglasses I'm the one of those things that what about yourself on screen cell phone screens another one that a lot of sense to you got to\nUse a P. H. neutral or civil no alcohol no silicon glass mayor I had a friend of mine asked me the other day said actually my TV screen but now I can see kinda ... street so that and I said\nWould you use\nThat issues in say a common brand of a window cleaner and I said it's got ammonia in it it's got alcohol in it it'll streak that finds screen and they go well how do I get rid of it you don't\nYou don't\nAh so ph neutral or products like the jaws cleaners um\nWould highly recommend that glass cleaner and you can also get it on Amazon meeting about that prior to it because of the spray bottle and um it's got cartridges so once you spray that onto\nThe glass and you do all these windows in your bottles half empty you\nDon't have to go out and buy another ball you when it's all the way empty you can fill that up with water\nTake that cartridge in just put it in the neck of the bottle and run the sprayers through it and it just versus um the concentrate in with water and you've got another bottle you're you're ready to go\nSo um you don't have to keep buying the bottle and all that saves on storage and everything else but\nThose cleaners a check that out another tip on clean the windows and we're talking about whether ... just kind of getting things all straightened up um is some paper towels not all some paper towels\nHave a little bit of wax and them so if you're using\nOh good products like a jaws where it's gonna be streak free always use a micro fiber cloth I'd stay away from the paper towel summer great I'm not trying to just knocked\nPaper towels newspaper that works good to know no ... newspapers but a micro fiber cause the ph neutral product like Charles\nYou're not going to have any street you know the glass so then you've lubricate decides to replace the weather stripping and you clean the glass so he did a really good job of uh\nUh getting those windows are ready for winter and again just make sure they're locked when the weather gets cold enough even got old wood windows you may not realize this you can actually talk a window close\nSo you know the old double hung wood windows when the wind blows you can actually hear rattle\nAnd um I think we've all lived in a house where that was the problem and if you still have those in your house or you can tighten those up there is a product called draft stop\nAnd what you get a clear talking that you can literally clock that ventilator closed can't open in the middle of winter though\nAre both cough closed income march that little clear ... will simply a peel away but if the windows are in the budget or maybe you're just you know bought an older home you're refurbishing it you've ... close to take some clear plastic\nLose when the kids in put those on the front I I'm telling you can take a really old drafting in official window and you get yourself another year or two worth the life of there and really minimize the draft are coming into your home so that's a couple of things if\nYou know I'm not really encouraging you do that right now but [noise] come January that might be something you want to take a look as if we ever really really cold winters just

grade there's probably some below grade too but let's address the one's above grade when you're examining the foundation and you see cracks in the foundation those can be patched up\nWith either a zip it mortar which is a neat little package a murder that can be applied to a vertical surfaces I'm you could also use the hydraulic\nA concrete patch little darker and color in most cases and I'm also dries really fast but if it's above grade I don't think you really need to hydraulic patch you just need some zip it motor to cover it up also look at that ledge if you've got a brick house\nA encountered this not long ago when I said really taken that walk around the house examining needs things keeps not only moisture output keeps insects out and I have a an invasion of aunts\nAnd I'm sure we can always talk about using products are getting exterminator and take care of the answer but really why not take care of their entry point into your home and when you're looking\nFor a a problems when you're doing your weather ... and we just talked about cracks in the foundation take a look at the brick\nOr sometimes right on that foundation sometimes to get the binoculars out and just kind of looking at the whole field or bricks which you're looking for is cracked the brick\nA crack\nMortar missing mortar and that's exactly what I found which was right on the a ledger the foundation and that's where I was having the invasion of the ants come in and they're marching right through the mulch and up into the crack can\nYou know we go we solve that problem by getting in\nA some patching materials as in solving that problem but that's the type of things you're looking for a crack brick a missing more uh cracks in foundations and get those things sealed up also you get utility pipe she got ... phone lines electrical lines cable lines\nMales slots all those items that I just mentioned\nAre penetration into the envelope of your home and addressing those issues with a ... keep the moisture out some parents have to do that\nAnd again when every year doing a like a gap between uh say gasoline is run through the foundation or phone lines or whatever\nA low expansion phone to get back into that crevices and seal it up is ideal yeah you can use talking if you want in fact if you want to finish it off with talking that's fine too but I get that looks Manchin phone\nThere's different types of phone high expansion low expansion if it doesn't talk about the degree of expansion of the low expansion forms usually used for doors and windows\nSo you just say for phone for doors and windows and\nAnd that's what you'd want to use around the even the host bibs that are going through\nThe um through the foundation also take a look at the clothes dryer vent boy I'll tell you what their big gaps around those things are great entry point for mice and a lot of places not far off the ground\nIf you take that ... and you can just take your pick your hand and just see if you can shake it wobbling around I think you'll find that a lot of cases\nA ears does wobble around you can connect that to the brick or the woods citing caulk around that or again getting some low expansion foam in there and then securing that good will seal that up and uh keep critters and called us from going in\nWas it to my son says in the laundry room was always freezing cold and sure enough um that the drivers vent close my goodness there's an inch around that entire hose that entire vent pipe and once that was sealed up and connected certainly took care of that problem\nHer and

would we had a call yesterday in fact in I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was they would call him and I can't remember how old the house was whether there was a new winner old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and there were suddenly cocked underneath it so it was hold water and it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can yeah yeah it can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's all you hear about all the ... or ... columns and whether there's solid columns order there how columns [noise] uh there's there's a there's definitely ... yourself um and remarried factor to prop hockey products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm whether what starts real bad with what starts to rot\nI'm rather than having her ... her entire column which is you use our hockey product called liquid would and where he talks and talks to patch up those bases and it's a real simple process or any of your home or you can use these products\nUm their ... and our liquid would product\nOf penetrating a pox would hurt her so\nWhere would start school go bad and it gets a rotted in hockey and saw right um what'd you do your brush away to lose crumbling materials that that that would rock creates and then you want to saturate all that or anything with black or using that liquid ... product\nAnd go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into the wood fibers\nAnd ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that stuff that serial hired all back together\nUm and mix up monolithic repair heartening all that would\nSo I'm so structurally it strong\nYeah absolutely absolutely the the liquid will it has a ...

rotted areas with that liquid water and then uh you actually acquire would've ... while that liquid would still wet ... ... ... ... ... is another two part of ... rather there'd be a liquor or like a party or solar ...\nAnd they use that to patch and replace the missing sections of all it\nSo you can go in and rebuild or anything that's missing and you can do barrel check cracks splits in the woods or you can rebuild entire\nYou know chunks of of material that you need to so there's really no limitation her to the scope of repair that you can make up something like that so\nThat was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was asking me whether that would be a good idea or ...\nOh I'm fall down basically and I'm going well you know if you don't want to go all out right away I mean we you know and\nThen I went in explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that the ticket for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nOh right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there are there ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so you know when you're when they're making that type or repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural\nUnstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ...\nNo you folks at every turn him good news about these products I Know because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about it then I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the restoration industry\nAnd and now reaching out to you know the D.

I'm In that ... again you can't get a puppy knife scrape off that wax ring and then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal\nA little bit easier to make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed in Mount ... on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a wax ring butts in case than rubber I'm In you'll tightened that up real good your ... on the floor of the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your problem [noise]\nAll right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that and the Charles welcome\nGarry Yes sir I got an interesting problem alright I had some holes in my garage walls and and I got those patched just fine [noise]\nThe problem is there's a ... on the war that looks like it's found with a ... like a quote unquote a plaster tight that's kinda runny and rock\nOkay I'm Wondering how could I replicated back [laughter]\nMillion dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nBecause we all have our own kind of artistic touched do it so some people do um ah do use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others will have a half moon or half ...\nUm type trial remotest [laughter] at a ... what do you mean by gripped\nUh it it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like it was just going to be when they put it on the walls\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping ... I Can't really visualize what the design would look like ... I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was a big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... spin out the ... of that topping compound and then probably take a like a wallpaper and brush a\nIn literally do what you just said kind of drifted or that's what I was thinking\nYeah yeah I think and and there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people try to imagine how that person put that on a big piece of cardboard and try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you come close but it sounds like if you're talking about\nBut you know a dripping or a a rain type a finished on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted a you know just maybe just a little bit sicker than paint and just kinda I'll use the word slap it on with the ... wallpaper and brush\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a pre mixing you're [laughter] yeah\nYeah yeah just use a regular um yeah pre mixed a I call it ... it it just makes more water and to give it more rummy\nShowcase that sounds like the solution\nAll right good luck tonight thank you take care Bye bye [noise] all\nWell we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred eight two three eight\nTo five five earlier in the show today somebody called and said men I loved that middle seat furniture polish one of my favorite products to it cleans and restores\nWoodwork wood furniture and perfect for kitchen kid that's it removes the grime the dirt scratches the old wax from the wood and then restore says by the way it's also great for removing the heat rings in water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's middle sick\nAnd it's M.

know this blindness too fat\nAnd and I know exactly what you mean is just to Smith of fat to get that rule or to push jets flying in take a snippet of that's flying in and get the next size down there's there's only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down you only got to go down to the next you know the next size will will get the job done for you\nWell the one that I've had the most trouble with is um screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it hasn't\nReached someone once you go into the group mhm there's a slight recession intellectual side mhm was it's like a ... it's not a\nI'm familiar with the flats blind to and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I've a big screened in porch and those panels all have the flats blind and um I trying to think how I chose this point I think I hit some at the house\nI'm In the one I head of the first one was too big the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with the roller and I don't know if if you yeah I I didn't measure so I don't know I had one that was too big and I use the next ... damage\nIt worked fine but I I get the challenge uh but I think if you can measure that actual opening\nA you address the the issue but I I get it on Netflix buying that can be a challenge [noise]\nAll right thanks much down a couple of tips too if you're gonna work on that um you know doing the show for thirty one years you kind of forget some of the tips you passed along in a screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's gonna be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in\nA lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year you would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows if you've got fools screens in your windows I'll bet you it's going to block a third of the light that's coming in your house may be more\nAnd if you get a good fall day papa new screens out you know if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen now take a look at the screen screen that the fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years\nAnd they kind of gets thread bear\nAnd now the fall is a great time to go ahead and do your re screening get it done on the big flat surface reach screen the screens allow more light in the wintertime\nAnd then you'll be ready to go in the springtime when they go back in in in to know which one goes into\nA witch a window\nStart with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharply input number one right at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house number\nBut replacing that a a screen now is a great time of year to do just that and the ... line that you're pushing that rubber eyes a membrane into the groove the whole screen intact\nThere's ... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... blind mice no we've got that wrong ... blind mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as from what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat and the wind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's climb into the groove\nSo good time of year to tackle that particular project a hundred and eighty two three eight to five five Marilyn welcome\nCarrie yeah I never I haven't\nHeard fire\nHaven't Eric I when I went to a ladder Palin here and I read the directions we have our our people are\nSo I had to come out and get out of having a little bit of problem or anything\nI can get are you finding them around the drain\nRounded around that area okay around that drain also [noise] um yeah\nWell one thing is and then we'll tell you about kind of maintenance so we don't have that problem uh one of the things the shallow bowl\nUh with some\nLittle water a little apple cider\nA low apple cider vinegar in a drop of liquid soap\nAnd set that up there'll be attracted to that and I'm that'll attract them to that and they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they like everything else are looking for food\nAnd that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on the sends a little gross or they're living on the bacteria in the scum that's in the drains All right so\nI I say often everything we use anymore as Jill we got ... ... ... ... everything's jailed and that sticky\nSo like me I use a gel a shaving cream um shave in Washington dumped going down the drain but that gel even though goes down the drain it starts slowly\nA coating the top of that trap\nOr the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe\nAnd that a gel combine with flaky skin some whiskey yours is a bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they started feeding on that and so there is a a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria\nThat creates enzymes that eats that bacteria [laughter]\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes okayed that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current pipe and uses a maintenance product gets called drain\nHow right at her\nFour ounces of water I think it's a forget whether it's a court of water but what I'll do is like\nIn the bathroom vanity a you pull up the plug the the stopper or you put four ounces of dream but when you're a little warm water and\nThere are you let's sit I think it's ten minutes and you release the water in it flushes Dan Coats the inside of those pipes if there's any minor blockages it eliminates that too but that starts eating all that bad bacteria\nAnd so you've taken their food source away\nOkay can I get that at the box or am I\nAm I I picked up at a sightseeing\nDo best carries it also uh I don't know if it's in the big box stores or not\nI get that garbage hair ... really\nGood I forgot to tell you about and I know other people listening let's repeat that that little splash guard that rubber ice bladder we put in food it grinds up its spits it all over the back side of that\nAnd it has to us right now you're in a how and\nWhy they're quite radical and now like the power of Africa that had like ... ...\nOh yeah yeah ... yeah\nWell the the ceiling probably less than the others but um I'd say a polish every two weeks it all on it just makes that granted scream\nI'm so cleaning it you know whenever it gets ... granted does\nWe clean it with uh the wipes all the time and then polish I'd say maybe once every couple of weeks or so and I was like granted really pop usually around the holidays coming up I'll take a little spirits are water spirits the granite and if it just you know doesn't appear to be soaking in\nI let it go or if you can't over seal it so no I just kind of protected\nOK okay

I had a handful there had to be a couple\nOf is that right yeah the the the cider vinegar kind of the same way but I liked\nThe idea of uh uh the cup in the Saran Wrap on\nTop of the they crawl through really just put a little kind of hold the tip of a shiny I sure they crawl in there they wire round but they can't get back out excellent excellent Lucian all problem\nThere is there's certain like thank you much burden appreciate it already\nOr I think you're really good alright used cheap here just I'm just saying All right let's get to a Larry Larry welcome\nOh yes sir um I got a\n... year my toilet ... think tank in my house for toilets year and a half ago I started noticing that when you flush them sometimes they're flush slowly starting to get worse [noise]\nI had to shut the tank and that any problem I started adding more water to bowl sugar water when it flushed and she actually [laughter] um\nIt has they might check to even the vents to make sure those aren't impeded with anything\nI had went up on the roof got ... in the air rent and I didn't see anything with a flashlight but no I not had anybody actually try to go down through them and I haven't tried to good actor I mean how long\nDo you have the septic bumped\n[noise] um it was about eight months ago now [laughter]\nYeah so it shouldn't be plugged up that fast I was a kind of lean still to the house the rest of the dreams work\nDrains were fairly well I have no second sort of three toilet you started with the caller was closest to drain when Russia\nBank ... moved to the toilet which just a little bit farther away now the toilet the farthest away from the main drank mhm still seems to me flushing fine but I have noticed just a couple of weeks ago that if she gets a little bit slower edits going\nOkay if you put anything in there possibly too but you know like a septic tank additives and we can't flush the toilet at all\nNo flush yeah you got a little bad sometimes go far sometimes they'll just water the water drained spot on the no actual\nBy ... ... um\nCan you got any other noise ... like I'm I'm I'm back to the air vents so can you hearing gurgling unlike the child\nThe vanity or anything along those lines\nNo I I put my ear against the main drain and it seems to me going find one in Washington\n... [noise] are we getting enough water transfer from the ah ah from the closet into the bowl\nI added more I don't know if it's not coming down quick enough [noise] wow that's a common where flushing them more and that's a common\nProblem not so much related with a septic tank but if we don't get enough philosophy of water coming from the a tank into the bowl it'll just kind of ... will you know sit there in ... uh so\nWhat are we able to water and ... yeah you might\nTry that okay let's just try that and I was there anything\nThat I can use the ... I still wouldn't be harmful to ... ...\nYeah the drain bow that I was talking about that would be one also um there is a a\nUm there is that septic a but if you just say the clean I'm not really sure you're going to need that I'm Still kinda concentrating quite honestly on the toilet itself\nLook at but I think the toilet or invent that leads yeah I think but I didn't try that on the climate or stick anything down\nThat's kind of the two things I'd focus in on you can listen to other people call and have their ideas usually when a venue here some uh gurgling Larry where it's kind of like grabbing for air maybe through a drain\nAnd I work I Would think that the other drained her brain slower to ...\nYou know so I'm kind of back to the whole velocity the flush um sometimes those poor holes just over time just get clogged in diminishes the force of the flush also\nTried adding vinegar to the back of the ball over like a couple of weeks period of time just to add more and more to it as I go and hopes to clean that out I don't know if they're cleaning\nOut of harms another thing you might try if you're familiar with the prophet called seal are taking a court of seal aren't just pour it in the bowl of the toilet let it sit overnight\nAnd case or you know that's again to see a large calcium Lyman rushed to just kinda cleans that uh we're the advantages and different things inside the toilet\nOr sometimes that'll solve some issues and so there's a title sales in flushing yeah there's a couple of other things to try and maybe the ... hour is not harmful to accept the anchor it's a it's a mild acid\nOkay so like the vinegar just write little stronger right okay All right I'll Try that\nOkay hope it works for you thank you much Bridget by right or just about forty minutes after it's up there it's eight hundred to three to five five\nMy right to the one more to like to get nine thousand Daniel wants his bonus I guess I don't know\nBut it's yeah Garry solving a public figure that's our Facebook um if you just go to that click like and what you will get in return is you'll get access to a lot of different information that we post all the time in fact he just posted the pot gifts for the uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Money Talk with Bob Brinker", "city": "El Paso", "day": "28"}
