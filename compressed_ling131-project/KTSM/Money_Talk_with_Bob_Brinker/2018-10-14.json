pedestrians were killed and Harry last weekend\nAnd the department of energy has a map on their website that shows you what the our values should be for the attic area\nFor the walls of your home in fact if you go up to a place that sells insulation that energy map is right on the bags of insulation so you can do that too so let's just say it's an hour forty two and the insulation is maybe in our three per inch of sickness you can do some quick math and\nI figure it's going to be around sixteen inches of insulation somewhere in that area and if you get up there and you're\nAs you and you got five inches of insulation you you know you get your work cut out for you\nSo can you put insulation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the insulation which I Hope you don't have\nUsually vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house\nIt let's say five six inches you know you've got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down on faced batting or you can blow insulation in and you could blow a cellulose insulation and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up the soft advance\nIf he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up in fact you shouldn't insulate over it at all ever never\nIf you have older can light you want to make sure that they're protected you don't want to insulate over them\nBut for the most part not a difficult job if you wanted to lay bats over that's fine bats are not quite well you know they're still gonna be a gap between\nThe would up in the addict that the Joyce the presses there's going to be a little scene there where's your blowing it and it's kind of film and all that area\nBut just adding insulation real good idea and get it up to speed the LA Times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are this is remodeled should be ours is but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do\nAnd also when you get up there just kind of take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic find mold on the underside of the roof maybe some rotted would maybe you've gotta moisture issue maybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in there and the nest was made in the inflation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got a breach somewhere in the middle of that house it needs to be repaired and maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point\nBut a lot of times it's outside it's out of mind\nAnd that's not always a good option so when it comes as we say to start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable of getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do an energy audit\nAnd address those issues eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nSir how you doing doing great\nRight now I'm them at all a cabin down in Santa Fe on the Tennessee River uh-huh I've got a guy will too but I kinda like at that rate foam inflation uh-huh have you here money going to do it right or wrong you write a while\nAnd the crowd things underneath it it got on the side of a mountain so the lord and it won't be jumping up in the attic he wants to spray it you're the top of the roof of metal roofing\nOver two by four that are on that yet a Mars Arnold ... over the vertical raptor ... didn't they rode out some kind of ventilation ... now certainly inflation unit hung in groups filling in it\n... but I have no way to get that phone to stay up and then do the dominant very we should just spray the top of the roof okay ... part of the route\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that room correct we're just going to encapsulate that whole ... area correct\nThat lady okay you don't need to do any um property marathon it if he does it that way\nThat's correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] I'm an older\nGuy I'm not going there I'm not going there so uh [laughter]\nTo answer your question yeah about Fifteen Years ago a company called ice ... started this process of whole house in ... and ... and it really is it makes an entire insulated Ava low to the house\nFrom the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require soften venting it doesn't require roofing a roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now so if you had air conditioning or heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's\nKind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever perfect the challenges that houses really sealed it's really super energy efficient you just gotta be careful that we have good I'm clean healthy air another word sometimes when we over\nA ceiling over inflated house you've heard the phrase sick building syndrome\nThat's when pollutants get trapped inside the home in the house can't breathe\nSo one of the things you might consider down the road and you see how it goes is\nWhat they call an error exchanging unit so it's actually bringing in some fresh air outside in a very small amount but\nClinton that knew of Mitsubishi the ... the little unit\nOkay right okay so it's exchanging air it's bringing Erin is pulling air out yep yep that's perfect man you're going to have a cabin\nOkay well that's what I needed it now has a dollar twenty five square foot like\nMan I really don't know I haven't had a price gal I really don't know I really don't know but you go that way I think it

off people a ... they wouldn't be in business for four generations\nBut having not inspected good idea\nAbout I'm changing the filter do you do that regularly you should\nUm and I'm going to be very general here but changing that filter every Ninety Days\nIs where you should be you know one of those big four inch pleaded filled her show those good six months and you got a little fifty nine cent far because one sure thirty days but most of the police didn't want you can get Ninety Days\n[noise]\nSo changing that you don't need necessarily a HVAC company to do that that's something you can do you keep your\nCalendar on your phone or if you keep a paper ... put it down on that date Ninety Days to change that\nSilver but having it professionally inspected and a lot of people just want to I'm\nJust check it and make sure it's good in a lot of people want to know what to say they have really good specials because if there is something they would like\nTo sell your furnace if you've got a good reputable HVAC person and they're running a special for I don't know Seventy eighty fifty I don't know you pick the price of oil inspecting clean your furnace okay and then they come in and they say well Mr Gleason\nYour he changing it is correct and you need a new furnace or this is done you need a new furnace\n\nI'm not saying everybody's a crook all I'm saying is careful be careful yeah exactly it's a lot of times they'll actually have camera inspections and they'll show you the crack and then you'll say okay maybe you get to ... maybe you won't I don't know it's up to you but don't make a panic\nDecision if you see the correct that go ahead price it out for me\nIf you're in a situation where it's really really cold in January you got to make a panic decision right that's where you kind of want to get this out of the wing now\nAnd if you're not comfortable with the person telling you that it does not hurt to get to quotes because there's a lot going on and the furnaces there's a lot of choices to make\nAnd when we have ah let's say under pressure and I'm not just talking about pressure from the from the technician I'm Talking about pressure from the weather we don't really do the research that we need to do\nA lot of times you know what what branch should I buy you know what the real important thing is the technician you're using the company or use and I said this a few weeks ago\nOr whether it's a roofing company ... company if you're dealing from a company has been around a while has a great reputation they're not going to carry junk because they're going to warrant that for a long time\nAnd they're going to be there for you so finding that good technician that's what you want to do so anyway just\nGetting nothing inspecting getting it done or\nThe key and please if you get a carbon monoxide detector in that house\nSmoke alarm in the house you could say that\nAbout year round but it's really important in the wintertime if you're not having that furnished checked in the chimney inspected potentially there's things that can go wrong and you know we'll hear about the news\nHouses get closed up and then this family had a carbon monoxide problem and\nYou know somebody passes away somebody's ... the whole family is very sick you you want to get that thing care and in one of the things that's interesting over the years I've done different stories in carbon monoxide if you feel like the whole family's got the flu but when the kids go to school they feel fine\nAnd you know they have a carbon monoxide detector they may not have the flu they may have mild carbon monoxide poisoning 'cause that's what it's like you can smell it you can't see it but the effects the human body is flu like symptoms interesting yeah\nSo uh I you know this one lady I talked to their family had a criminal oxide problem when the kids went to school and went to an overnight and one of their friends' house\nKids weren't sick lady when she went to work she was sick she got home\nIt'd be watching TV should have a headache just feel lousy wake up\nTo be horrible good work feel good huh and what it was the the the pipe that go into the chimney was closed and\nDidn't have an inspection and the Jews were going right into the home so make sure you get a carbon monoxide detector but it's very very important\nAh John welcome morning how are you

uh you can use different um like a grand a gold they make a grout stone cleaner it's going to take some scrub and\nYou can use a Mr cleans scouring the sponge a that'll clean it and then the secret is to get that um get that sealed\nAnd that's the key getting killed so\nI mean in the path to clean it but it just seemed like a material that I purchased a you know didn't clean it like a more value there yes you could always tell that it was wider over there\nWell I'll tell you what I just clean some gr out uh with some um granted\nGo route cleaner and then I see that with the sealer and we're

deal that the algae uh-huh well back now but I I kind of like a skating rink and we we brought this guy yesterday and we were going to do it today and of course we can't because of the training that we wanted to know if they're wet and forget what the hell I'm On a brick [noise]\nMm well well hold on you use the wet and forget correct we gave him I think yeah OK did to get rid of it are no good okay we\nGot a lot of tree okay and it's that the attack\nAnd is it back in the exact same place where it was yeah\nWell that that surprises me a little bit Maryland because the wedding forget it does do a complete kill and the complete kill should I'm not going to say prevent because that's too big of a word\nLet's say slow down the progression of ... gross a so it does leave they I I guess it would leave a little bit of a film nothing that you should be able to see nothing that shift\nThe slippery but um since it is a complete kill it should take longer for the ... growth to take place now you say there's a lot of woods and a lot of shade so the idea yeah so yeah\nSo let's do this um I think that whole problem is telling us something we can certainly use the wet and forget again and lemonade ... you know it works um in it'll kill it but I think we need to get that brick sealed oh\nI think what's going on remember the mold the middle do the algae to fungus the like and all that can grow unless there's moisture so we've got a shaded area we got a lot of ah um dust that's on that broke we got a lot of\nA morning dues and drizzle and he keeps that brick wet and if that brick isn't waterproof per se it wicks that moisture in and it's um it holds that brick or holds that water net brick\nFor a longer period of time so if we get to a mold the bill doing everything off and then we use a brick ceiling\nOr brick waterproof and 'cause you don't really want to seal it you want to allow water from the backside to transfer through it but the rain water you want to keep it from absorbing into the brick and then I think what will have is we'll have that problem pretty much fixed up\nNorth side of the house and it kind of year we hardly ever get any\nSend right here right right right and how old is the house\nOr the how forty eight years old okay but getting their patio with cutting last fall okay but we did not feel it\nOkay so this is on the patio this was on the floor so that kind of a reverse rain\nYeah we had company coming and they got it yeah one name and what yesterday\nYeah it yeah you need to get that sealed there's no question about it\nSo you can get out as so we can spray the wedding forget on their if you'd like or if you want something um that's immediate so you can do it you know in a day or two\nUm we could use like a high grade a a missionary cleaner in fact there's a website let me just give you that Marilyn you couldn't decide which way you want to go okay we know the wedding forget work so but we also know it's going to take four weeks to get it to clean and the time of year we might want to move a little bit faster\nSo it has to do that when I get\n... probably I I don't have the label in front of me\nI had on the label can we read that\nOkay well if it doesn't ever precaution know it can be spread anytime the K but I'm the website that what you look at is called masonry defender\nMasonry defender\nAnd what they've got his they've got a main street cleaner\nIt's a high grade oxygen they bleach which have recommended for years it's you mix it with water you spray it on your weight about ten minutes\nThen you take like a big street broom and your scrub scrub scrub pick your hose rinse it off\nAllow that brick to drive for a day or two and then apply their paver sealer all that there's there there's websites got six products on it [laughter] okay so it was real easy to find an order right on line and are you what the ... cleaner and then the brick paver sealer\nAll right well that's you\nKnow there you're

Ninety five percent I'm home a leaky duct work\nAnd another misconception that's out there and then you know you may hear someone say well I knew that you can tell late yeah well it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it's prone to having you know points have leakage\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't know this but was Seventeen years old my job was to run duct work and I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right\nThat when we put those two foot pieces together we didn't have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of growers and that the setting of the the ... and certain states across the country have code now that require that for me the old when it's installed tell\nThem when you were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duct work at our home so we need newer technology duck works\nThat probably help huh\nIt would be OK Harris yell help yeah\nWell we're going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the homes of leaky a duck work if we changed it you you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that is true All right so I'm ... so it's a good bet that every one that's listening\nThey're not getting the efficiency of that furnace they're not getting that heated there\nTo the places they want so what is zero seal\nWell they feel is a technology that been developed about Twenty years ago and by the department of energy act really uh-huh yep down at the UC Berkeley\nMhm mhm um and it was it was developed to help make the duck system more efficient ... that the best way to put it to fill up the tiny holes\nAnd crack a that our our typical and into an adopted some ... and ... also at the at the long term uh you know almost permanent type illusion so once you do this technology\nAh it failed up the duct work and it's guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test that to last up to forty or so in most cases uh as long as you're going to be in your home\nRight right so it's kind of a liner well kind\nOf I I some people at the simple if I look at it like kind of like six of flat in a way okay but\nAnd to be real precise about it it doesn't actually coat the duct work when it does is it find those holes okay like they have a balloon pop a hole in it mhm you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure on different right right\nAh our technology and able to find those holes and then he alone from the outside in a negative air pressure exactly that's exactly right\nYeah ... ...\n... is that right okay All right so ah so\nI had just done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\n[noise] Thirteen Years ago and and I notice the difference immediately so if a homeowner\nFirst of all you got to find a deal with it in stone that I'm assuming that you go to our soul dot com\n... dot com and there's a locate are there\nAre okay so I called this company up and I say I want you to check my ...\nThanks a A R a system itself will check to see how leaky the duck forget so we do a before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine [laughter] they can run a test\nTo see what they charge you ... you know like a blower door to us for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests and there are similar okay I'm different dealers approach it differently a you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways scary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really it's really pretty easy to find a you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence that fine well\nUh one of the easiest of course you mentioned that right when we began this segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal for that that far room to be colder than the rest of\nThe how old is normal it's Ninety five percent of which [laughter]\nBeing you need to stay informed news radio six Ninety Days [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nRight back at it ten minutes before the top of the hour we're going to continue with our project week it's going to be a long one of the day because it's a fascinating\nProduct um talk into Tracy Martin She is with arrows see on talking about a eliminating leaky duck work in a you know you're paying for that either they're supposed to make sure gets\nTo where it's supposed to be you know if I'm buying a new furnace and they're probably going to be a lot of people buying new furnaces you're in the next month\nYou know I mean we turn us like just you know the blower is bad or I mean you couldn't just I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here but people find out that I found out last year\nMy furnace was bad just about this time and it's kinda like ugh but when you're working with an H ... guy I'm can he checked the duck worker ... because like if I'm buying a high efficiency foreigners\nAnd I got crummy duck work\nHe he you know can he helped me at all\nHe sure can and there are so many different ways to check for evidence of how your ... you know performing how healthy in the ... there are simple tools and find that a lot of contractors Carrie it's called a smoke prefer okay\nYeah holiday it would have done that gets a little too but that will blow the smoke and find air current\nFor example he put your hand ... you're talking about that experiment ... right right see smoke coming out All right shouldn't be anything blowing right right and you you turn on that smell pepper ... you see that it's blowing either sucking it in or pushing it out\nThat's not a good one yeah and in for a red\nOr let's say that by asked this question so you don't have to have the big blow tests that I had yeah you do not eating out so they shoot an infrared camera on a wall and all of a sudden you got a big old red line going right through the middle you were like what's that all of\nA ... it's like the ... right in the wall and he had in the heat and cool\nAnd like you got to register behind the wall and that's not helping anybody\nThat's right that's exactly right\nSo in all HVAC guys carry those for the most part\nYeah and more and more these days mhm but at the home on an island and I would ask how are you going to help me make sure that the Clinton is going to work your way to pursue what are you doing to address my doctor work because I Know how important it is a daddy Clinton\nAnd we also know Ninety five percent of the people heavily ... that's right so so we already know you're not getting your value when you buy the new economical\nYeah like I was getting a lot of that a lot of the equipment manufacturers now ...\nConsumer literature they are now including warning about hoarding ever got brick right and they're saying there are things that can do if they are caught because Harry cause any fish and the drain shut assure you ask about your duct work sure\nPanic because they got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent furnished his not lowered my eating build one bit yet that why it happened\nYeah sure you're right All right\nSo if you are buying a furnaces getting installed talk about talk to you technician really about the thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leaky dj because otherwise you're not going to get the value of that I'm highly efficient furnace if you're living in an older home and you got\nThe coup spots throughout the again get a hold of an HVAC guy limb to thermal imaging thing go to ... dot com in a you can find somebody that's uh um skilled at a installing this particular thing and you say the paper that usually in around the three years yeah on average\nYeah that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're perfect duck working in a nice nice uh efficient furnace and I have a steel and the duck we're\nAll right Gary I can do this one in my sleep you're good I was thinking to myself that might be an unfair question grow up with a well known now or in a\nKind of fun because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do all of the things that that can do um plenty that can do one of or two of the things that when they break it down for a year ago\nA if you're a homeowner who has their own deal done on your desk work and the things are going to notice they're going to be more even temperatures throughout your house none of those hot and cold spots cool\nAnd you're also going to notice a difference and the humidity you're going to be able to better control\nThe humidity in your home so you have a dry hole or a superhuman home that should be even doubt that should be a big benefit air quality now this one this is near and dear to my heart I'm going to be breathing the nasty contaminants from the ... faces in the attic or the ...\nAnd it's being sucked into the leaky Duckworth gotten right\nAnd then as the the lady of the house I might not have done that much ... and so that's that's a fun one my wife and he made those are the more than I just wanted to read on the dining hall a job a\nDumpster well she doesn't go he'll\nGo less dusting less allergens energy savings you will notice that as well and then this one is also I think really important and that is it's going to produce heck and prolong the life of your HVAC equipment and it's going to make sure you you get what\nYou paid for next year you get the efficiency which are hoping for and not show doesn't make them\nAll right um music playing Tracey thanks very much for a swim in the studio in tow letting us know exactly what folks can do because I Know this is a big problem I I get questions

ended up here I got mine at best I can get them on line or whatever kind of very accurate and rechargeable and for two hundred dollars worth\nYeah in fact one of those things and thanks for that tip to Scott because one of the things I was going to interject\nAnd I ran into this a number of years ago when I talked about thermal imaging is um you know somebody brought up at all you can get a nap

phone ones are when that's you know might give you a basic idea but it's not going to be super super super accurate so just go through that and they're All right let's get to a rich welcome\nGarry show thank you\nHave a a theater fence that we put a twelve years ago and when we put it up we stand it and now it's\nTo the point where it needs to be re saying okay my only question is does it matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm going to guess that's\nPretty I'm pretty much a mute point at this point probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just making sure it's a really clean\nAnd that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up um that can be done fairly easily I'm using an oxygen needed bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use the would ...\nThat really opens up the wood fibers at ... no matter what you use for the use acrylic or whether you use a oil base\nUm it'll get it'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's gonna last longer\nRight but uh if you had an oil based on who the only time you know there's always there's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that there is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names is is it is neither in oil\nBase Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun um in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon it lasts like seven years is good stuff but if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it\nBut if it's just an oil in like a ton Laurel base or\nEven ... base or or water base at this point I think just\nGet in and oxygen a bleacher would break ground or you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great one other question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fun\nWill that my friend is is I I don't know but I'm all about that first you gotta know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're all\nAnd K well maybe money [laughter] they they kind of started operating like us at that point out and ride retired I think you've had by by\nMaybe a spray or maybe it's a prayer would be cheaper than paying the grandkids it'd probably be a little bit better job just saying I don't know you don't know yeah you're hanging with the grandkids right yup All right good man good man\nAll right it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab a line as we talk a little bit about home improvement remodeling repair again it's eight hundred and eight two three eight to five five lines are open so have added Terry welcome\n[noise] hello yes\nMy ... now you talked about that one to call at the bottom and then the one that didn't have the smaller ones some place\n[noise] what's your problem what's wrong with the mode\nWhere I come down and sometimes it does come K. and I checked out problem with them and asks how they are and and replace at me wrong I Want to try what you had\nTo All right so um so the flush is not not working around it's not removing all the way so right usually when the waste is not thoroughly removed it's because the\nAmount of water that is coming from the closet to the bowl is not coming with enough of a a velocity there's not enough of it that's number one the other thing is\nThe the bent pipe set you check the top actually kind of come into a bowl of the toilet to takes water and air man and sometimes that little vent becomes um calcified ... narrowed opening so you don't get an affair to make that happen so\nAh let's work on the vacuum first\n[noise] um and and you know so we got a fifty fifty shot hear Teri ... a bottle of C L are\nAnd that that get back here than the burden on the phone I have a bird thanks ... makes all kinds of\nNoise he has a bird's name [laughter] hide fly directly I play it over five is Seventeen year old oh my gosh he's an old friend he's an old friend and say okay what are the product\nOkay it's called C L O R\nMhm and it means calcium Lyme rushed remover it's a mild acid you just take a whole court bottle and before you go to bed at night you just pour that whole court bottle in the bowl into let that sit overnight when you wake up in the morning flush away\nOkay yeah I remember that but I couldn't remember I had a little more care that I write everything down there who said that what ...\nSo that's that's that's the one chance the other one is the water that's transferred from the closet to the bowl is transferred through little holes underneath the ...\nPlain dog okay you're\nNo doubt that because it really didn't want to have to stay on the big problem and my cousin told me that firing down here and clean the mind and but that one one like upstairs in a real real oh darn\nWell let's hope that uh let's see all our works\nOh okay well thanks a lot I'll give it a try it and then I went it's kind of haven't replaced anything in the tank or any place ah oh gosh for about Fifteen Years so uh\nI don't think it's really you know it's more the issue with the tank then the
