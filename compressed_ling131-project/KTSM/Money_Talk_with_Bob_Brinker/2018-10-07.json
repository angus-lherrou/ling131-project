... lawyer at the time of really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through\nEvery one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job pointing out the hypocrisy here [noise]\nUm I mean if we're if we're going to have a serious conversation about drinking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss ah and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there's no we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is\nA fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and where it's just snowflake gonna vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had seen a real warrior and pushing forward look at a hearing and Grassley knock on the Internet and I think in the crap\nYou're exactly right and then they could we could go if we would have had like Harvard or calcium or China I think he can hear that we might not next heroin you and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrats\nThat'd be ... they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at it gate or\nFive thirty percent margin that people want to see happen often from five thirty percent margin that people have North Dakota once the cat and knock at first it would be political suicide\nOr hike camp or match or you're not vote for the nominee don't ever get out of principle because there are lapdog but they might get out of their own political interests loop Beckley right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins\nAnd Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri\nBecause if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get I mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah I mean [laughter]\nDon't come at a real don't drunk principal is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's a conscious of the conservative ham and if you know if he is then now we're in a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter] you are\nDelusional

his own state race it off to the northeast\nNew Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says go I'm only

E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened out we have Carmen best story he's with GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that almost scary Sullivan\nHey good morning Gary how are you doing fantastic how 'bout\nYou I'm doing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years\nOr that's we have we had incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and\nA lot of people I guess just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so can you can you comment just talk about an overview of lightning in general ... kind of dig deeper\nWell it's a great time to be talking about lighting October is energy action month\nConverting incandescent are halogen to Eli day is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting shorter and actually getting longer\n... really has changed with almost come full circle Gary in terms of like bald performance and we had CFL we can add energy savings and long life but Canada sacrifice that\nLike quality or that slow warm up for that flickering\nEli is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent ... in terms of bright light\nDental\nComes on instantly what great color\nWithout having the sacrifices other things that we had with CFL and get the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you Eli de lighting is super energy efficient as\nIt is if you look at age sixty why incandescent bulb now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm Mm LAT\nIt's using eighty five percent less energy it to the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty ... light bulb mhm\nUsing less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty ... so it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than a traditional incandescent off\nNo when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got a one or two ... made the entire switch I get in there and I see flood lights they see\nYou know what is um you know like a sixty ... old fashioned bald and I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli ... correct\nThere is like with anything in a home improvement store or had a mass merchandising store or there is different is in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality because you're looking at\nLA de la ... brightness they don't want to necessarily at\nThe water's edge because really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what all is looming right the sixty what bothers going to produce about a hundred women in the first ... for as\nI thought that has around ... author lumens\nThe second the you might want to look for his life so there's different tiers of LA days okay some last ten thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which will be three hours per day is dairy equivalent of having that bought last for Thirteen Years so you can do something different on your Sunday Morning instead of just like\nAll like the last one I ... it was like thirty thousand hours\nYeah isn't that amazing that it was fantastic ... that's perfect for me [laughter] and then\nThe third thing the thing that LA to his kind of opened up for us as on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the software in light\nOf incandescent bulbs and they can provide that but not everybody wants incandescent like light or maybe in different rooms to your house you want to create a different mood or different effect mhm and that's what ... has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now\nIt was a vintage lighting oh yeah ... where you see the like old ...\nExactly right from inefficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more electricity but not providing a whole lot of like a lady now has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight\nGlow mhm but using a fraction of the electricity so you're using\nFive lot instead of terms he was perfect person and you're getting along life for this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent\n... also switched ... and get those benefits\nWell just taken everybody back from when they went to shop for their first Eli de bulbs they were confused about lumens they were confused about energy savings they were\nConfused about the lighting and then different people start talking to them including me start talking about Kelvin units right up to seven thousand the lights blue and super bright and I made a mistake myself buying the wrong brightness a ball but\nThe reason I wanted to have young Carmen is genie lighting his finally got it together in terms of changing the whole lighting industry back\nTo where it was where you've got you didn't know that the mood or the light of that ball which is you know like a softer why the bedroom like you made it simple and I love it [laughter]\nWell for most people spending hours thinking about writing is not what they want to spend their time on\nYou know coming a PHD in life falls is not really where they want to spend their time or energy or effort going down into basically simplify it now with chocolate consumers we know that people use light differently in different rooms of their home well so now that there's a lot of\nNumbers and things on the package that frankly get pretty confusing so he could provide\nThat down to three different types of light there's relax which is a more warm comfortable type of light similar to incandescent you might want to use and a bedroom or family room places where I kinda wanna unwind okay there's refresh\nAnd then turn it off the air you want to do is that South on it and take a scribe eight\nAnd three minutes late wife and that right now huh it gets off of that\nSo just regular table salt and a a ...\nThat tent regular guys I won't say what that is that well then I felt as though as bad\nExcellent Victoria thank you\nYou're welcome and I have always a pleasure to show\nThat you very much call anytime soon ... by by by All right there you go I knew somebody I Know\nI I don't know about\nPressing machines but Victoria did and she knew how to clean them sort of thing I thought you knew everything no sir I Do not know everything John welcome\nGood morning I was just turning radio station I heard your show thank you [noise] ah I had a lot of like ask a question about a light up\nAnd make a flight that reflect the light out of work that are out of ... out there may be a threat to life for showcases yes why couldn't they make a reading light\nThat reflects light downward so or you can read I use the though Condes flights with one of the the ... oh [noise] oh I'm Seventy one so I think my eyes need more light up my eyes are okay but you can't get a good reading like\nI'll tell you what when when you listen to Carmen and he was talking about different lighting and putting\nIt on the back end of the big part of the Congress\nOK I'm One of the things that I I Do is from personal experience All right so I too was always in search of a good reading light and I'm\nA CFLs are horrible for reading a incandescents yes they're not bad uh especially the old soft white were good\nWhen he talks about the LAPD he talked about three different types of lighting and you can get really involved in nearby even talking about the brightness of the light is its measurement is cola Kelvin\nUnit the higher the Kelvin unit the brighter in CRISPR the light is so in the scales from one to seven thousand so if you had a light that was\nSaved five thousand or six thousand Kelvin units it would be a really white almost bluish white Chris ... lite\nWhich is excellent for reading G. E. rather than getting into this whole Kelvin units because nobody's going to do the research to really\nLearn what I just talked about it they've got different categories of lighting from relax to it's called relax refresh in reveal\nIn the reveal is the one you're looking for in that is a higher Kelvin unit light it is it is it is super Christ and it's for real close work or reading\nBut they're reflect light doesn't reflect light or do you put it in like into a regular lamb and a light goes up through the shape to the to the sailing well look I always look for like ... like an eating lamport reflects stuff like the actual lightning but only downward\nI I don't think it reflects light downward but this light is brilliant it's brilliant light I I I Would encourage you to give it a try I don't know what that reflects downward I Know the latest that\nCould affect the reverse aging lap mhm every direction you know to to the area and they put that coating on top to wherever reflect the light\nI remember the old fashioned incandescent it had a little silver kept to it [noise]\nIt reflected them but I have not seen one in in L. E. D. like that but again if you're searching and try and different lighting John I Would uh\nI Would encourage you to find a GE reveal I think you'll find it a really critical light and a do it doesn't reflect down I think it's going to be a brilliant in terms of being able to uh see the details and help you with reading so that would be the tip that I Would offer you\nWrite from there we go to Alex

Koch all the way around it but everything I've read on the Internet shows that eventually though who should fail\nIt okay keep gone\nThe other the other is are you can do it it just has to go in under the under lame and and then um there's ways to make the post um have I have a thing that goes around them obviously that's\nA Butte are\nWell you know like a ... exactly that that keeps the water from him help training um and then the others are floating back you could do a floating structure on putting basically on top of the\nOkay for me or that one I'm familiar with the first to 'em\nAnd and I yeah so when you first asked me I said I'm not an expert in doing it in the first thing I was thinking was your first option and that is where you puncture at UCLA there is a modified roofing cement that will seal that but anything\nLike that will fail I mean it might give you ten years maybe Fifteen\nA but it'll fail a eventually and so you know if you stay on top of it that's fine but it's gonna eventually fail the boot I'm I Am familiar with that and they use that concept really on quite a few different roofing apparatus is I'm\nProbably the most popular is like a bent pipe that goes through a roof be at flat or a even shingle roof\nThey use that booth concept where it's actually applied underneath\nAnd the puncture is you know the the ceiling that actually takes place by this booth and slides over it I Would say that's going to be of those two because I'm not familiar with the third month of that particular uh choices I Would do the one with the boot\nI'm it's going to last longer and you're not really\nUm you know puncture through it you are to a degree you're building a rounded\nRight [noise] so okay well thanks for ties up like ... or ... or I take care of by\nAlright Fifteen minutes after the top of their eight hundred eight to three to five five that's our phone number you can join us you're at home with Gary Solomon\nOne on one with Gary televise every weekend classes began and one eight hundred eighty two three saw your hat\nWith Gary Sullivan\nEl Paso skews radio guy [noise]\n\n\n\nAll the holidays are just around the corner and it's time to take a look around your house both inside now see what you can freshman up\nUgly counter tops old ... floors did you know you can do it yourself\nAnd it'll be easy which spreads don't buy Deitch coding stuff's amazing it's a role long coding that'll give you the beautiful look stone renew your counter tops floors even outdoor walkways before the holidays dice buildings are available at home depot dot com or factory directed da ... ... dot com\nAnd then each year from grand a gold Lenny you've been telling my listeners the three steps to care for natural stone clean the own polished but how do I know when the seal\nYou just do a simple water test you put a three inch diameter of water to let it sit there for Fifteen twenty minutes at what shall we beat on the surface if it starts to penetrate or lay flat on the stone that you know it's time to refill\nThanks Lenny the best sealer to use and the one I use myself has granted cold go to grant a goal dot com\nGet ready for fall and winter with Lester industrial strength silicon lubricant it's the perfect partner to get all your tools and equipment ready for the season\nIt's great for shovels and blowers were keeping Snowe from sticking it reduces\nFriction prevents rush to protect from moisture use it on all your rubber car door and window gas gets to keep them from sticking in the winter to pick up a can of blaster industrial strength silicon lubricant available\nAt Lowe's or a major hardware store near you always use bless their products and work at like a pro floating shelves are so hard to install you never get the screws in the right place it takes a bunch of tools and then it's still not level\nWell I Love the new high and mighty floating shelves they install easily in drywall in seconds without a single tool they're template and building level show you where to place the mountains pushed the mountains in with your songs in slightly shelf on high and mighty shelves a variety of color styles\nAnd sizes can hold up to twenty five pounds find a retailer at designed to be stuck up ...\nHi I'm Lana costs and a farmer ...

the cabinet or been more does have as I said in interior\nA out kid the water base enamel which is um is very good and they have a matching primer it's called advance\nAnd advance comes in a ... comes in a set and finished comes in the semi glossed it even comes in a high gloss finish and uh it has a matching primer a perfect for used on cabinet tree or I Can't tell you over\nThe years and I've done this for a long time over the years when there is a painting issue\nA very very and I don't know if I've ever seen it\nAnd that is that the paint was bad\nI'm sure it happens but every paint manufacture every paint batches May Day keeps samples of the tested in case of consumer has problems with the with the ... and then they go back in the paint company and the pain company will say it's usually your preparation or there's moisture involve or whatever the problem is and\nI guess if it comes to push comes to shove they test the batch that they have on file and\nYou know like I said I don't think I ran into where\nThe paint was bad it was always the apple of cater and it was always\nThe preparation or there was water getting behind the substrate a but if you do the preparation and you can just about pain anything alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nDoing Gary Yes sir fine\nHey got an a some kind of bounce off you got a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub and I'm putting a shower stall and its place hum and all the ... is in right now\nAnd when I the shower up to the army chief I'm\nA blast a drain you familiar with those\nTell me what's the name is again this is so cheap I'm a drain that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass pipe\nStraight and the BBC comes up\nOn all okay into it and he put that new frame washer and they're right and he tightened down okay so it's like a compression fitting\nExactly and it's about an inch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there was a great big hole underneath the original Plame was put in for the job and that's where all the mice were coming in\nAnd so I boxed all that and so now you basically have to have a boxer with farming\nOr going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that and when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it will be buried in that box um and I can't afford to have a weekend and and so\nThe BBC's been tested no leaks that's all well it up really nice my concern that in the brain washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neal praying a gas can actually call it a washer\nIf I put some silicone seal on that gas as well and fly it down into the drain and it goes around the b._b._c. and then I tightened and not on top of it um ... when that silicone dried I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking\nBecause if I get a week I'm never going to know I have a week because I Can't get it on\nThe shower vase once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on that makes sense that [noise] um [noise]\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber ice\nIs Robert Robert it's round about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the [noise] the drain it so he got their compression not and it's supposed to you know basically compressed than\nUm but the b._b._c. can move a little bit and I live in a little bit I'm I'm afraid it that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak\nIs going to go over the water she's going to go down that box I built in actually rock what time\nIs at the end of the world I mean ... is that a cesspool if that happened\nI got to tear the or the quality of a mobile home care the blanket on okay\n'cause it's kind of the showers kind of in the middle okay and I'm I'm a ...\nIt was like yeah take up the whole sharp pain or anything like that\nIf I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the shower so it's a full size to the show you at the bottom half and he got when I when I put that on and I don't recall in those two together like manufacturers are supposed to [noise] I'm never going to get it out [noise]\nSo you got to come from underneath\nI thought I'm going to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have\nA week and Ross right yeah right and then it might come back so one of the problems I have with the silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nI'm ... and I don't know I Would have to look into that\nIf I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's it's it's designed to to work together as one grain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an inch thick you know we're pretty sure that this about an inch cause slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taken those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it fails and you hit a leak and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nI Know we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world it is we're terrible it's you know not like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can you can repair it I'd be comfortable with the ... washer um I don't think I Would\nUse the silicone unless I was really certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the ... and I'm not going will compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you call and you know if it fails five years from now that's one thing if it fails a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of disappointed\nI Would need a pretty more should be good for a while\nOkay I'll give it a shot [noise] All right good luck to you John I think\nHe blessing that sometimes there are people that chime in with their experiences too so yeah\nUp with the ... the perfect stormy episode is your number one TV strains that says we top TV stream is our radio very low for\nTaking my call you bet um we bought from South ... to put in our maintenance building uh-huh [noise] and um it it will go in the office and the bathroom [noise]\nBut when my reading they stop directions hair and suggestions or it has happened chair needs to be between sixty five an eighty five year around for the life of the product and that's just not going to happen [laughter] maintenance building\nThen that's probably the wrong profit I guess yeah I guess we should get that get back in ...\nYeah because it's gonna happen it's going to affect that it eats of I don't know which do you have is it to connect do word has kind of like a song and it has the the east of there\nAnd his team Howard the whole that whole back at the ... or whatever that is\nWell obviously there and he said that they\nPut on there is compromised and women you gets below sixty five degrees so if you're not going to have it that that's not something you want to use\n[noise] why you know when you go to Florida and one or two like hardwood floor in your house uh-huh um you have to keep that at sixty five or above ... we don't\nKnow okay no no\nHardwood floors I mean they're all kind of different there's all different kinds of it eases there's obviously a reason to manufacture does not want this\nUsed during temperatures because they know what's going to fail\n[laughter] okay and I didn't have Daniel I had another question All right we'll see what\nI'm writing or shall I call the advertisements uh-huh hate your house right have yeah I've never heard of you to talk about that\nYeah in fact we even had a gym for runners shield on back in the summertime uh really but yeah um so it's a lot of paint it much much more than a paint and this is um [noise] it's\nGot many benefits it's I'm very very durable it's much thicker than paint it also has some energy saving properties it's got a um it's got ceramic coding in it\nWhich bounce back you know solar heat game um\nGood foot go over a looming fighting perfect fighting as something about it was put on a fixed mhm [noise] but you know if something wrong with that right painted that want\nOkay well again and how long ago was that\nProbably Twenty years later that's pretty good and money tied yeah that's pretty good [laughter] so that's really bad but\nThat's really your option so aluminum siding whether you go with the rider shield or you go with paint\n'em is is probably one of the best substrates to put a coating on because it's it's stable it's not absorbing moisture um it's like ... not going to crack it's absorbed moisture so it's very stable\nPreparation again the key runners she'll do that the runner shield is just heavier duty than a pain it's like I said it's a coating it has reflective properties\nIt's going to listen I mean not paid last really good\nSo that you know I mean that's certainly an option for you or the rhino she'll be probably wanted done I I'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that I forget what the war and he is but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years\nUm but I it's perfect for ... it's\nFeet for aluminum or vinyl siding\nGreat okay I'll I'll be looking at a fan\nYeah getting what it what it's going to be and make your decision\nPaul Beck and call\nYou're quite welcome Ellen thanks take care Bye bye yeah that he has um [noise] well\nI'll tell you what if you go even ah I I kept talking about the signing but even if you're a\nDuring the run or shield over would\nAgain it's it's a more flexible sicker coating than some of your paint so ... there\nJim welcome yes or how the\n... comment on the guy but shower base or the chart was uh-huh and I put a piece of hard work off underneath there on a box you Bill uh-huh so um [noise]\nIt doesn't change the water would have it like first of all make sure that the the shower doesn't really have somebody wrote a bunch of water while he's on to their native ... not going to bail begets I\nAgree and and then when he\nSo instead of being ... completely what would that a piece of artwork walk on the bottom or if it does grip and he's going to have to go under there to ship as dripping\nRight he'll ... he'll see on the ground below that it's ... and it's that\nThat's not a viable option you can use fast ball that sort of expanding ball uh-huh in my mice will not eat through that he can all caps late that whole grain system with that well\nAnd to ensure the ever does have to get into that dream bidding spray it first was kept long or a coating like you use on a\nGarage door chain overhead is your have long base and the ...\nStick to that easy seed and let it dry and then ... that whole thing was that also\nAdds some insulation properties to uh to correct yeah I I didn't remember what part of the country why didn't they ask and I forget I

I think that would just damaged the plastic\nYou're right in and that that would be a good solvent to remove it heats up but not going to work on that I'm really the only other thing I could think of and I hate to see go run and buy a bottle ten dollar increase of remover but you hear me talk about a political ... piece of remover\nIt and and that's that's not going to hurt the plastic um it's word he sort of I don't know if it's going to remove a boxy though I'm\nNot really sure what fun there because you know how it works it's more or less like to choose you pay right and and I can't even though I had a huge that on another part of the helmet it it's\nHard for me to think that that got on there and weighing down because it's just that it is not liquid they've already said\nYeah [noise] so did you use the glue or no\nYeah I did but unfortunately I I just can't recall it very well put it in the mirror you know that that little tiny too but that clear what it was\nYeah so they're so like a super glue right\nExactly yeah yeah\nSo that's I Know a cruel like and there is a super glue remover\nUm but again I don't know what that's going to do that plastic shield you'd almost have to try it down at the bottom to see if it's going to do that shield I think quite honestly I mean I don't know what kind of glue used but I Would bet that's\nIt because the ... that is really really thin and ... runs and\nIn fact some folks make a sign of acrylic that as a gel which is a lot more manageable um but there is a two ... of equal size as the super glue that is super glue remover\nAnd um you know that would be something I Would try uh did you say you tried dean natured alcohol\nTry rubbing alcohol\nAnd then I tried the good stuff and then I Try to hobbies all there yeah and I thought that would cut it for sure I I'm not sure what the scary because okay it's\nIt's it's it's you know it gets unusable now that it's right or anything I Do it it's it's worth a shot\nOK okay so okay where am I going to get stuff you're talking All right so if\nYou have any good natured alcohol in your house try that if you have any nail polish remover you can try that\nI tried that I forgot to mention I tried that after the out of it that they then what made it a liquid solvency\nAnd spread it\nYeah and then so that the super blue remover\nOr you can get it at a hardware store and I think\nI feel pretty certain ... it's going to do what the finger nail polish did is going to liquefy but then it's going to smear another ads you all day I was going to have the blood it was like I

sure it's in good working order it's not too late\nBut I get on the phone right away [noise] All right you got the\nPhone number we're going to get a right back to work we've got to Michael Michael welcome\nI Yes sir I have a\nQuestion for you I I have at least ... voters on my house [noise] mhm and solve the problem we make in the Senate butter or anything and I you\nKnow so you got the the gutters with the helmet on the top of the top her\nYeah yeah yeah is it all one piece\nYeah [laughter] [noise] how much of a gap is their\nHobby just in my hand in between there wow and they're getting down in there\nHuh um\nThey keep going up to ... yeah oh yeah no I'm not sure so I don't know\nI I don't really know if the gutter brush would work on that I don't think there's a big enough gas to get that stuff in there that would certainly\nUm keep the\nBirds from making a mess in a nest in there it's just kind of like a bottle brush Michael that slides into the gutters but I don't think there's a bigger enough good up a big enough gap free dislike that brush and\nIs there any kind of chemical or\nThere is a a product that I don't know much about it um and I don't know what it does the birds or anything like that called um tangle foot um\nYou might take a look at you can get a garden stores or hardware stores\nUm it's a sticky substance\nUm\nBut that that would be a possible option I don't know of any spray\n'em\nThere's no way to really put any wire barrier like a hard work lots in there I don't suspect\nIt'd be pretty\nYeah yeah so if you're looking for a quote chemicals spray something along those lines you might just Google a product called tangled foot it comes to talking cartridge\nOkay All right good enough yank you thanks again reading member somebody\nAnd uh I don't even know if it's made anymore used to be a\nPretty popular product but I'm\nAn environmental standpoint I don't know if it's out there anymore my check that I'll check it to the next break right to a Wisconsin we go amber\nYou're welcome yes my name is ... and I love your show um I have a\nProblem I have a little bit and let me mine and a heart transplant and we recently moved to a trailer that would donate it\nAnd what do you think about a month a year\nAnd we have a leak in real and and pretty sure that there might be more on the Internet and not happening\nIn the insulation mhm\nI have ten dollar hit hit that lady I'm Wondering if you think that they were\nTrying to remodel trailer with a pen and now it or what we should\nBut I think the first thing you need to do is you need to confirm whether there's black mold and there are a dangerous molded than they have to be black a dangerous\nMold or not um and you can do that by um\nInexpensively amber it's um it's a five minute mold desk at you can get them it ace hardware it's almost like a pregnancy test kid it's a little plastic device in a swab\nYou don't have to swab the mold you can just swab around the tops of doors you some of the you know there's usually dust on door frames a swab that and inserts that into\nUm into this test kid is it'll tell you if it's dangerous mold or it's not dangerous moment\nIf it's dangerous mold\nThen you really got to consider whether it's even worth remodeling that um because that could be not only just in the insulation that could be on the\nUm backs of the uh panels of the walls\nIn other words that trailer may not be able to hold has value to take care of that\nA particular you know the issue so the first thing I Would do amber is is test for mold and then kind of make the decision from there as far as the league you know whenever you have water introduced to a house\nAnd you have organic material there is a good chance you mold and may not be black mold or the dangerous times more but you would have mould or you would have maybe a common variety of mold that wouldn't be so dangerous but I I'm thinking\nYou got some big issues with the roof leaking and you've been sick and you've got um\nUm you know you're able to observe that there's some mold and the insulation of patching the roof I don't know how the trailer is I don't know what the problem is somebody to take a look at it and see what it would take to get that straightened out but I I'm going to venture to guess that the answer is\nI'm no it's it's probably not going to be money well spent in that trailer or to um to get rid of the mold and to reconstruct it [noise]", "show_name": "Money Talk with Bob Brinker", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "07"}
