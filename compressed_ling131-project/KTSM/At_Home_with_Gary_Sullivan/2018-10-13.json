{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "So we're going to take another quick break right now when we come back I Want to talk about authenticity with watching\n\nWhat's going on rock and roll lovers and he went on a journey back to this week in rock and roll\nBack in Ninety seven were Jerry Lee Lewis records grief falls fire now famous hours into the green balls in my recording sessions Jerry ... began arguing with the songs too simple brand new record talk loudly over each other and we lose to believe that his music can actually\nBe more for moral good\nAs we can find the Ohio State university marching band please hang on will be the first time doing things on Illinois becomes in Nineteen eighty five is designated song of Ohio\nAs we can Nineteen eighty eight blue in the dark side of the moon's finally left no more than two hundred album charts record breaking seven hundred and forty one week\nAs we can Ninety Ninety any better lives from his home in San Diego to Seattle where he meets his Pearl Jam band me was the first time a week the recording to becomes the ... of their debut album\nBetter was chosen based on mobile he added two or three song instrumental demos ban may\nTwenty well record label losses in mind we only vinyl anniversary edition of the Beatles and then we print divergent any musician Ringo Starr during the run version reportedly selling on ...\nAnd there's a lot\nYou can go to Facebook Twitter Instagram or ... trust and sent me a message that way I'm I'm always happy to answer questions if I don't know the answer I Will find it out for you and so I wanted to talk again about authenticity of watches [noise]\nNow uh we had a a lady come in a couple of days ago with a watch that she purchased on line and she wanted it authenticated that it was a two tone style Rolex\nThat she paid eighty eight dollars for an ... she was told that it was authentic and she came in here and wanted us to check it out for her\nAnd so there are a telltale signs that those of us Rolex professionals use when we're looking at a watch to determine if it's\nAuthentic or not now just to refresh my memory in Nineteen Ninety two\nI became a Rolex dealer at my downtown store um and then in Nineteen Ninety six I Believe\nI became a Rolex dealer over here on the west side and so there have been many many watches that I looked out and many that I've repaired and we still have a lot of new and free owned Rolex is for sale\nAnd so you get to know what it is that you're dealing with but remember that styles change marks change the way things are designed to change and so if I Would use the knowledge that I gained Thirty years ago\nFor now I Would be way wrong every time somebody came in\nBut I have to read and keep up with all the new developments in all the watch friends that we do business with so that we can keep up and give you the right advice\nAnd so you really have to be suspect if you're spending a little bit of money even if they say it's authentic now the good thing about it is if it's been misrepresented there's\nTwo things you can do you notify pay pal and that's why it's good to pay with pay pal or credit card because both\nOf those places will get you your money back and quickly without you having to deal with it\nAnd you can put a review or a complaint into whatever site you got it from a less it's a site where that owns like a store and their work it out of their back yard and they don't care if you say oh yeah it's not authentic and I want my money back\nYou never know you may never get your money back\nNever send a certified check or a wire\nNever ever do that because you're kinda stuck trying to get your money back and if you use a credit card or pay pal you're much more likely to get a refund on whatever it was and the reason is that when we\nUm when you charge something here it says that I then we run it through a terminal and it gets deposited in our account\nBut if somebody complains and they find that that complaint is valid they can go into my account and take the money back out\nThey have the power to do that and so that it's really hard to um it's well it's actually easier to get your money back that way because they will work hard for you and they will make sure that you're satisfied that a lot of the credit cards have like a Ninety day\nA policy where you have to be satisfied and if not you can return it and they'll and you'll get your money back but you have to find out from your credit card and you know credit cards are the same thing as far as reading the terms of engagement or terms of agreement\nYou need to see what you're covered for now you may not have to read that but just call them up I did this the other day when I kept getting membership fees on one that I only purchase\nBecause I wanted to get some free miles and I used I did what I was supposed to do but I have is the credit card for three years and I finally called them up and said what are the advantages\nOf me to use his credit card I already have another one from your company but this one's a platinum and I have a gold\nAnd they told me and once they told me that things had changed what I got originally with that was no longer and so I finally said just go ahead and canceled that card and I don't wanna pay membership and I will lose anything specific so you need to call the credit card companies and find out\nWhat extra benefits you get by using them\nAnd write them down so that you remember to use them\nSome of them have free a reimbursement for things on an airplane or a when you charge or a rental car they cover the insurance I mean there's so many things and in fact the last time we did it was about two years ago so\nI'm Glad I'm bringing this up because I think I'm going to put it on my assistance log that they should do it on my credit cards and find out what the benefits are\nThe only problem of course is that I have to get on the phone because they can't give them my username and password and mothers' maiden name and date of birth and security question to answer [noise]\nSo that's how we got into credit cards from authentication but don't ever buy anything without checking it out especially if it's on the Internet now if it's a company like\nA big department store where you feel comfortable buying their that's one thing but if they don't have a physical presence [noise]\nAnd if you don't really know who they are don't take chances you also have the chance that if you give 'em your credit card that the credit card number could get in someone's wrong hands and then you're going to have identity theft and it's going to be one thing after another\nSo you know there's been lots of other things that happened I'll tell you real quick that one lady called me and told me that she's the granddaughter of a lady in El Paso who's Ninety four and when\nI called the world's worst boss the new ... new jobs like looking for anyone with a bowl we'll just go there must be\nHygiene let's talk about that job you posted for senior manager okay I've got a lot of applicants already posted on that huge national jobs like what a waste one guy says he's been everything from don't walk or do you get home uncle you here staying home uncle and dog Walker here super one guy who loves animals\nPosting on that huge national jobs like just wait times ... irrelevant applicants are we're looking for people who are willing to have a great sense of humor and here's a guy who's this guy\nDriving clown not qualified to me we need serious applications from local candidate know resumes from me on a huge national jumps right please don't remind me Dave do\nReal do you find your perfect local employee elbow so ... called local

really don't care if he's not write us to tell us your data was until somebody that that would be a real big move Dave\nYour dream now just when you come down to drill merit how\nDo you are you\nLearned out territorial haunted house on an avenue and you're open ... Saturday morning members are in a giant Gallagher trio haunted houses are used\nYeah they're very Montana there was only twenty nine year old ... ... you know when\nYou're going for Ninety wanting overview was\nThere was less so I'm getting older one need to worry about swollen yes you do\nDon't feel like a crack between your your a buyer steps of it rises or something\nYeah um so tell me about the correct how big is it or is it just the hair will\nWill you advice me to get back to Raj okay and that's what I got ... okay and I also got a little bit of sand to put in there and the bad rides but I couldn't remember the stuff you're told me or like quick creek\nKids self leveling your thing crack sealer ... say that again please self leveling year thing ... okay\n'cause I'm ... I'm going to the big box store today yep\nThat's the one you want to use it's got the best ... got super flexibility and um that's that's the guy that's the guy\nAll right ... thank you much John and uh you bring up a good point whenever sanding whatever using any types of ... compounds it's imperative that we go ahead and ...\nPrime that first and I'm not talking about skipping that step if you have a self priming paint\n... it's just a really good idea to just ... I and I know you've got to buy like a quarter primer and you don't want to do that but if you can get that done especially if you have an area that's you know let's say the size of a\nHalf dollar or something if you can get that primer on there and then use the pain was a primer on it you really going to minimize\nThe flashing it'll do what I mean by that is that patch even though you're putting pain on ... shiny\nSo ah certainly recommend doing just that eleven minutes after the top of the hour and let's get to a Chester Chester welcome\n... Chester yeah I'm here Yes sir\nYeah I've got a project I'm In the middle of a\nConcrete for and it's over and it had a indoor outdoor carpet go down to it\nMhm well over the\nYears it's been a cut and\nPart of a poll up and left a concrete bear and I've got to replace it\nNow there is a little bit above the residue of the glue that we used to go down mhm now I'm going up\nBut a pale and stick\nA carpet tiles down to replace what they're now ... and I'm just wondering if the um how to deal with the that go that swept over\nWell it's always going to be a good idea to remove anything that's on the surface whether it's pain or whether it's an adhesive and when you're removing it he's a from a concrete floor there's\nBasically two ways to do it you can do it or mechanically or you can do a chemically so you can either grind it off\nOr you can use a stripper product to remove it and this is indoors so you'd want to use 'em you know a non toxic uh is he serve remover one I recommend is called blueberries they make a blueberry he serve remover\nAnd um you can use it indoors you put it on let's sit for a few hours and come back and scrape it off but always a good idea to get anything that's all on the substrate completely off before really do anything\nOkay [noise]\nI have one more little washed out just hurt you tell the guy before may about a crack\nSailor Yes sir that's a self leveling Europe the and\nYeah and it depends on the size of the correct whether I recommend that or not\nYeah yeah this this ... about a quarter of an inch\nQuarter of an inch yeah you can use that or there's um\nYou know he was talking about backer rod and everything else so that cracked up to half inch wide they've got something that's quarter inch or less there's also a product called crack seal that quick ... makes it comes in a court jog with all nozzle on it\nOkay and that does a real good job of judges filling quarter inch cracks or even hairline crux of the you know some down to an eighth of an inch a self leveling also done after we traveled\nUm it's not quite as flexible but you don't need it to be quite as flexible\nYeah OK yeah there's some there's some little eight tension hairline\nToo yeah that year thing wouldn't fit in there so you'd want the product called ...\n... or ... thank you\nAll right very good Chester thank you much I Do appreciate it

you want for this is called the older ... concentrate\nIt's four ounces to a gallon the secretive using this as you want to saturate that\nAnd one of the challenges that we have and you said I think

you know what the weather good weather [noise]\nAnd then ah\nSo I think it was around ... ... and April early may that's what I stand it\nSo that's one of the challenge if that's stain his deal that would I'm kinda\nWondering how they urine is penetrated into the woods\nTo create to smell and to hold that smell for two months so we certainly want to saturate the wood because and I use the word saturated cause that is the way you should apply it but I'd really concentrate on where the boards about each other okay because that probably is unsealed\nI'm In maybe a cut down between the boards that are unsealed urine was whipped into the woods and hence we have this lingering odor yeah but I feel real confident that that product will eliminate your problem wing\nOkay All right so shady Yes

license is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy\nProcess okay so seriously it is that easy and say I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Sylvia of a old flood light you can just simply ... yes\nIf you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the plate up you're not actually holding the light and in your head it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd uh went that's once that's mounted you take up to light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nReally a fear because you know let light the maximum flood light is easier to mail that a flood light you buy the big box slowly really is because of the quick ... am absolutely have really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's that your door\nSo I'm at work you get older and I'm In the office in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes the sound\nOr ... whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise what however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can\nTalk to them have a conversation if you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar alarm that can\nBe press so if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for for downloading viewing later\nSo so if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter]\nYou can see if there's kids come into the house and\nSee a lot ... usually not every child legs are products Weaver lots of stories last couple of years to sell this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you were the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an engine again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light a application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the poor side does come in different um different styles and different finishes 'cause we try and accommodate you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any ... competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as it relates to ... you know really know competitors\nThe flight there was another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe and our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera\nYeah the quality of the cameras detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera [noise]\nIt's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera so detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the from where the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource hum heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals was oh am really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day in time\nUm it's just it's again there's so many features and our app that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle when you talk about the distance but its position of all too\nYeah so it's a it's a ball basically um both the the flood lights and the coach later the other a porch lights\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball and that can be when you first installed the product\nYou want to aim that cameras you get the optimal a field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a locking ringing lock that camera and the place and then typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the live feed or you're watching a video later you can ... you can actually ... so you're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if using them in with the pension is great\nGreat so I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines of someone that has a question about the

radio six Ninety Katie as Sam\nAll right mark hunting cut he is my\nGuest she is with maximus lighting and we've been talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates LED lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds\nBefore before what before you see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weeks in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver of FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video you actually watch the driver walk up to your house and put the box on your

hundred eight two three eight to five five in Diane welcome\n[laughter] mhm how can we help me yes\nWell I just had a question for the cattle and talking about ... what the camera uh-huh now what happens if somebody perfectly that their damages or cover it is that possible for them to cover it so they can't do anything\nWell sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the share of the um the view of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you got to walk up you got to get the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means is on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on and the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question to die and you're thinking\nThere's not alarm goes off on your phone if somebody were actually not a light off the wall face so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\n[noise] okay I can think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart in order to what you said a hundred and eighty two three eight\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI ah I have a question we choose to run around the same trigger heart\n... yes I mean the um ... you know if if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean that's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the Arab you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she couldn't do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any I\nI just curious 'cause we are very true life you know have them all turned off the air every ten minutes though they're turning around the house and go wandering if they are the way to get the sense that\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control is Bones Are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once you stole the product you can kinda tune you know which alerts you want to get the ones that matter and again we've we've built all that features into the product in the up very cool and then\nSee that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five she'll a welcome\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or any how Kyl's or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I don't\nI mean I don't think of the show\nOkay well ... actually today marks\nReady to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone that says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either their wife eyes out\nOkay or the power's out but we don't offer um any type of supplemental power at this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nUm interests so we don't meet the disappointed does need power to operate\nInterests you you had all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful oh All right um I just thought", "show_name": "At Home with Gary
