{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "Talking about it I could talk forever about the jewelry business and so I appreciate when you come in and say that you hear me on the radio and that it was something that you didn't know that I taught you\nSo thank you so much listeners for listening to me and letting me talk about the one subject I Love the most jewelry and gemstone [noise]\nOkay so remember if you have a question you can give us a call at five eight four zero zero to to you can go to Facebook Twitter Instagram or interest look up Susan eyes and and send it to me that way you can go to Susan ... dot com and hit the contact us button\nOr you can call the radio station at five for four or five eight seven six while I'm broadcasting here from the show and they'll put you on the radio\nSo remember when it comes to knowledgeable advice on jewelry come to Susan\n[noise] so at this symposium there was just so much that I learned but mostly what you learn when you're a a perpetual student like me\nIs you learn how much more you don't know and how much more you want to learn and so every class I take about diamonds they talk about like where they're from or how their mind I Want to know more about that and more about that and I think that's why teachers become teachers because they love learning and they love teaching\nAnd I love to go to these classes because I learn new things and then it it motivates me to learn more and more and more and so you can go through your whole life just being motivated to learn [noise]\nAnd I feel very privileged that I'm able thanks to you the support of El Paso and making my business success so that I can afford to go to these classes and symposiums\nThe other thing about this symposium is I was asked from the American society of appraisers to do a poster it's called the poster session these um uh our topics that people that are experts right about and then you walk through and they're like little exhibits\nAnd so I decided to ride on the difference between appraising and ... and um luckily it was accepted by the jumble logical Institute of America I Believe there were Seventy seven from all over the world\nAnd mine kind of critiqued why just because you're appraiser doesn't mean you're ... and just because you're a ... just doesn't mean that you know how to do appraising and so it was the difference and the similarities between the two\n[noise] and so I Will be posting those pictures on my website soon but what's great about this business is I never know what's going to walk in the door\nFor instance this morning it was a pocket watch but right after him came in a man from Mexico City who was referred to us with these two rocks that were of course all gold color\nAnd he had he wanted to sell them and as much as I like to learn and keep learning I have to rely on experts when it comes to something like that so of course I started asking all the questions where\nDid you get these and of course he got them it was melted down pieces that were from a mine excuse me\nWell gold coming out of the mine is not here it's mixed with other minerals it's mixed with stones dirt all kinds of things so I couldn't way it and make him an offer I couldn't test it 'cause I could only test the outside and it's got a lot of impurities in it\nSo I told them the only thing I could do was have it tested in refined and then get back to him\nAnd he understood what I was talking about it was English and Spanish he understood a little ...\nBush and I try my best to talk as much in Spanish as I could but I don't know all the technical words of for my business in Spanish but we were able to communicate\nAnd he agreed to um to let me do that and once we do that then we can assume but it's only assumption that whatever percentage of gold in the city has that it's the same percentage in the other ones and that way I'll be able to make him an offer\nOn the gold are based on what the um what the results are from these now that's kind of tricky because just because\nTwo are like that doesn't mean the other ones are like that so we'll see what they come out I have no idea if they're half gold three quarters gold I don't know if they're twenty four carrot or how much care it wait there isn't there I Do know if it's natural gold\nIt's going to be twenty for care it's not going to be outlawed humans do the outlawing\nBut it's going to be mixed with a lot of things and I don't know what and how much percentage\n[noise] so um that's one of the crazy things and I just decided this morning that I'm going to add a page to my website on unusual request that I've had because I Do take a lot of pictures\nAnd um it might be an interesting page for you all to read when you want to know a little bit about us and what we do and those rocks will be there\nSo another and so will some of the watches that we've we've looked at\nAnother story of something that came in was a man looking for a diamond\nAnd he had read a lot on the Internet but of course it was on a ... a site where people are trying to sell their goods\nAnd so he was assuming that everything on there was accurate and when he started telling me and asking me questions right away I said no that's not true where did you hear that oh I read it on this site\nOh I read it on that site so if you really want to know about gemstone the best place to go is G. I. A. dot edu\nThat's the um school that I went to that's the one where I've learned everything from that I Know I'm plus a got gone to other seminars and seminars that they've led and that's the best place or if you want to come in I have a full library\nOf books and pamphlets and all kinds of things because you can never have too many books too much or too much jewelry and your life that's one of my models\nAnd so it's really interesting what types of things happen here and what people bring me now sometimes they'll bring me rocks with a gemstone in it or like a crystal and they'll say what is it now if it fits in mind machines and if it's something\nThat I can test I can test to see what it is but the machines have limitations and you can't put heavy rocks or big things on these machines that are made for gemstones\nSo sometimes we have to send them out for a certification or sometimes all get 'em inconclusive test results\nSo all tested with five different machines and it will be natural diamond all ... all one machine will say according to what the machines is that it's a synthetic or\nThat it's a cubic their county or something like that and so if I don't get conclusive information than we have to send it to allow that has millions of dollars of equipment and scientists there that know how to use those machines and can send it back to me with a full report\nSo if you have gemstones that you've been\nKeeping or you borrowed or you got 'em from someone in the army or you bought 'em out overseas and you want to know what\nThey are we can tell you what they are and um [noise] you can bring them and there's a charge to do the\nUm the identification\nAnd if you want a U.S to give you a report we can give you a port report we can pretty much do whatever it is that you want if you want a value we can also give you a value so I'm\nBringing those gems says and I love a good challenge and I'll tell you what I've seen lots of things that when I looked at I felt were one thing and when I tested there was something else we also do coins but we do not authenticate coins\nAnd there's a lot of fakes on the market now online they're making fakes as good as they are the real thing so I Hope you've learned something today I look forward to talking about Christmas fare next weekend and we'll see you next Saturday at twelve thirty\nNow Hi I'm Susan eyes and\nAs a native El Paso and I started my jewelry business with one focus in mind making sure our customers are always proud to wear a piece from Susan I just find jewelry and watches thirty two years later I'm Still

you want to deal with the professional I don't think there's going to be a product that you're going to use but here's here's some of the developments that's going on and granted fact actually hit the guy on the show I think it was last Saturday or maybe in the last hour the name of it\nYou may hear me talk about green a gold a lot they make a lot of different cleaners and different things like that to people that own granted cold is a three or four generation granite company\nAnd one of the things they're launching and this is what's going to get you the information is if you're buying a

of the top granted people in all the city's so obviously you don't have a uh granted protection plan because it wasn't even though I Do but he has that network\nAnd um I once you go to ... dot com my

up here and I think I really need to get an order before a snow and all that kind of stuff right what's your recommendation on how long should wait\nWell um you should wait until it's dried out in the way to find out if it's dried out it's usually a moisture content of twelve percent or less\nUm there are meters that'll tell you how much moisture and that would or just get us Brits are bottle and spread some water on it and if that water soaked into that would right away it's ready to suck in the stain um the the brand that I'm recommending is in the ...\nA deck stain you'll get an extra season or to a life out of that holds up to the sun well it's a mold and middle due to a degree resistance got nano particles ... great stuff um it's ... dot com there's all kinds of videos on you can see\nHow they recommended supplied even though it's brand new you still want to clean it with the oxygen a cleaner hit it with a deck right near that opens up the wood pours which allows that stain to penetrate even deeper\nJust pay attention to the temperature again I'm not real sure what that limitation is on that stain it might be forty five degrees or so so you're going to want to pay attention to that but literally when you clean that deck you can sustain it two hours later so it could be\nYou know maybe a little work on Saturday little work on Sunday and be done\nSounds pretty good\nYeah well one other thing just just ... most of the damage is done to pressure treated wood is caused by the sun\nIt's not the snow and it's not the rain so this time of year if you got caught by the

Gary I'm I just wanted to ask you a my wife and I are building new or in the kitchen part right now are trying to figure out some of the more interesting [laughter] it as a quick\nOh yeah the ... that\nMy wife is really interested I'm right now our kitchen ... it'd be a white kitchen and she won a a print arm think uh-huh and then we're trying to figure out what that material is cause that others yeah several out there but it's trying to figure out what you ask them what could be the most durable\nFrom ... so the question so what are you looking at like a glaze porcelain and then a composite that type of thing\nUm yeah and she's also looked up the cast iron where\nOr when the name on it now as well yeah well in there if you had a\nI don't I I you know what I haven't really done a research is saying this as best I think one of the things I kinda like right now it's kind of the composites only I mean the cast\nIron I mean let's face it the cast aren't ... been around for hundreds of years right I mean they're pretty drew role but you know if for whatever reason we drop a big old iron skillet they have a tendency to chip\nA composite it a composite I think is a little bit I'm less likely to be damaged to but I haven't really dove into it to really compare that to\nHave you looked at the composite jet or not\nI'm a little bit here and they are but I mean we just kind of started within the last\nDay All right well those are the two main ones that I Know a ... in terms of their ability and that's the two I guess I Would investigate further I\nI don't think you can go wrong with either but porcelain blazing does chip I mean but you and let me put that in context to sodas granted you know and and they can both be repaired but I I just kind of get\nSome uh folks that are selling both um you know get to a a ... kitchen ... show room and in give it to people that are ... both of them all the time get their take on it and there may be something and I'm not even aware of shown to be honest with you to\nThose big farm sinks are beautiful and they they are trendy right now\nYeah I Know they they are already friends on it All right my friend daycare thanks Bye bye and if if you're listening and you have some take on a love to love to hear from you too so feel free to jump on board and mark welcome\nYour longtime listener thank you\nGot a two problems here in the same area let me give me a little background first it was just for a church sanctuary where we had a slam problem okay started where we had a pipe shall we had to replace the current but what we're used to\nWe found that the slammed in one area had a reason not to to fight break [laughter] um but it was a difference of one inch between one slamming the either\nSo we put another great system around the outside that seems to be working we finished at July and it's a lab is or\nBuy happiness but not as only half an inch change in elevation the first one I Want to know is what you're suggesting is on fixing that slab of looking at things want us to just grind it down so that you got to eat and ... between the\nBoom and the second is\nTo kind of a a section out a Fifteen inch section is about forty foot long area that we got this problem in and cut back section out and in a slope down from one slap to the other there so I ended up looking the same but they're two different methods\nIn terms of cost a big difference I guess between grinding and then I'm cutting the whole sly about reporting and sloping correct\nI haven't really priced him out yet I I\nI did get a little price one time on on the cutting them out I did not get a one on how you\nWrite in your own them down how how sick is this lab\nLab is five inch five and\nSo really grinding a half inch shouldn't you know create any a issue with the um integrity of this lab itself I'm\nYou know I mean to fix it permanently I guess I'm kind of liked the idea of grinding it out or not grinding it out but actually cutting it out and replace him put a little slow but if we got a five in slab I think it's going to be a lot cheaper to grind it probably focus on going that way\nOkay if you if you cut it out with your pin it with your pin\nYeah you have to you and a half to ... at a construction joint oh\nI really look at time trying to grind it I really what I had a store one time it was all his lab and we had an area because they poured concrete when it was like Fifteen below zero and we tried the patch it first that didn't work and we try to ... parts of it they cut out and\nIt was okay it kind of work but it was very expensive to do the whole thing and then we grain part of it and it did fine\nOkay we'll look at the grinding I I Would take a look at that and that in fact I probably am both bit out and take a look and get their input on that but I think you're grinding is going to be effective and\nThat's lab is thick enough and it's going to be successful and be less expensive\nOkay the second question I got is that one nice to slabs rose uh [noise] we had two problems that habit one is that for a for daycare construction joint\nThe construction joint spoiled and it's probably at the crack probably maybe about inch max someplace to just three quarters of an inch and probably about an inch and a half white how would you patch\nAnd that's away from the joint or just on the edge of the joint\nIt it starts at the joint and then go back in ah probably about thirty forty feet\n[noise] um you could do that with a type of mortar I'd talked about a political zip it mortar which has a um ... it may not be enough he may have to just go with mortar and just have the ease of do it\nYeah so it's going to be you know paint you get ultimate production solid color staying you get fairly great protection dark color ... parents you get a pretty good protection when you get down to clear it it's weak in terms of protection\nMm [noise] but it's a little if you want so you got to decide if that's the look you want you're probably going to put that on there every couple of years or so\nYeah okay and if it's called the FAA\nDefied D. E. F. Y. you'll use their debt cleaner or oxygen needed bleach is what it is and you clean up real good and then they have a deck brighten or I Would use that object brightened a re stores that would to kind of it's natural color and what it really does is it opens up\nThe pores in the woods\nAnd that enables that that ... that clear ... deeper into the woods causing it better protection\nYeah OK okay alright me shave it All right thank you my ...\nYeah the clear is the weakest of any brands before you even get into the brands I mean you get into kind of the good type ... cleaner or ... and you get a clear six months to a year and a sunny area that's it so that's okay\nYou just got to know that you're going to reply every year you're getting clean it\nAnd re apply every year and if you're using ... that's a built in ... so it's not like you're stripping it sanding it or ... you know anything along those lines you just re apply in another\nVote but that clear it just doesn't hold up to the sun in anybody's brand it's the weakest link but you can use it you just go to ... Jeff welcome\n[noise] hey Gary how are ya I got a question to question for you know first I have a large one shake shingle roof\nAnd it is starting to get a lot of moss build up at the end of the shape okay and so I'm Wondering what I can do about that it prevented second\nIn some of these trench all rain that we've seen this summer I'm getting you know the water that's going over the gutter and it has fallen down on them I damp concrete\nAnd I'm getting some of them ... ma build up there as well I think maybe from the roof mhm so to\nLive in power watching that but uh it seems like there's gotta be something that I can do to coded that might prevent it from building up the way it is no\nJust yeah yeah well whenever we got a water you know outside we certainly got all those spores that are going to grow exactly what's growing on your roof and on your concrete so what we can do uh I guess the first thing they ask is why is it spilling over the gutters are the gutters\nUndersized do they clogged are they what's going on there\n[noise]\nAll right I'm going to try something that the gutter brush\nThing you said I think it may be a little bit on your side but it really only on we're\nGetting those trench arrange a normal rain it doesn't happen ... do you know what ... they are a fan I don't think I may be a orange yeah yeah\nWell minimum you'd want on your house was a five minute for five is spilling over probably six or the Governor Bush does a good job keeping a leaf and debris out it's not going to do much for clean gutter if it's still spilling over\nA but just keep that in the back of your mind uh obviously as much water as we can keep off that slab the better it's going to\nUm stay non moldy in non middle do so there's a product you hear me talk about all the time the wedding forget product [noise] um so the wedding forget spray they make it in a concentrated you can put it in a spray tank\nOr the hose in wet and forget you spray that on the cedar roof it will get rid of the mold mildew or the moss the algae the fungus like in and everything else\nAre you spray it on and you could do the same on your stamp patio it'll probably take\nA anywhere this time of year four to eight weeks for to disappear but you spray it on and it just dissipates\nYou might notice it or you might not notice anything for three or four weeks but it'll kill it it'll be a complete kill it will um minimize it's really gross it won't prevent it but it will minimize it\nUm you could come back on that roof and spray that every just two or three years is a maintenance spray yep as a usually that stuff's grow and a couple of years before you ever see it but it'll help minimize the re growth as there go ahead\nOr anything like what we get it then I go down there to protect it because it seems like eating away at the shingle\nSure and it is ... and it will um so yeah there's there's certainly Steelers for cedar shingle their Steelers for your stamp concrete\nAnd the more you can get those particular ... substrates sealed the less water penetration of curves\nA but first the first step is to get rid of the ... do make sure it's all gone when you come back in the in the springtime or I Would send you to a a website called masonry\nDefender or they have a stamp concrete steel or I Would get it on their when we're talking about the the fly would stain that too can be applied to the cedar Shaikh group which the minimizes water water penetration in both those substrates\nAnd um then you you know they're they're both was just going to be maintenance issues [noise]\nAnd the answer to the feds or steel concrete that Yes sir raw\nAnd they got a really good you know what I mean you know just make sure all that ... completely gone\nBefore you start to stealing it but one forget interior either the concentrate or the hose and we'll take care of the problem [noise] alright music fun and I hear ya I hear you we got another hour coming your way you're at home with Gary so [noise]\nWe can be a never ending was of things to do around your home get help but one eight hundred eighty three off your at home with Gary is Katie FM am El Paso [noise]\n\n\nEl Paso hum Hi I'm Lana cloth and a farmer ...

uh we had family over and and I put a garbage bag outside\nOnto the concrete and apparently the grease or whatever so through the bag onto the concrete and now there's a big a three foot strained by eight inches and I was wondering if there's a way to get rid of that\nYet is that Greece is that what it is great for meat or what is it yeah yeah okay um what have you tried to have you tried like dawn liquid soap or anything along those lines\nI I did not um I was afraid to use anything to push it back into the concrete march out late\nSo um I I got to to suggestions one I feel real certain about the other one\nWould subscribe and you might get it done so when I say the dawn I'm a lot depends on how sealed or how um deep that Greece ran into that concrete which is what you heard about two but Don brand the liquid so\nIf you put that on there and just you know full strength\nUh dampening scrub brush and just really work at it and work at it and work at it and then flush it and then maybe put some more dawn on their lead set come back and really working with a scrub brush you might remove that\nUm but it's going to take some scrub and um another option\nThere is a product called ACT cleaners\nI usually recommend it on a petroleum based stains like motor oil greasy anti freeze that type of thing ACT was actually invented in the oil fields in Oklahoma\nAnd this cleans machinery it's actually an enzyme it's a powder you sprinkle it over the grease thing and it does work on on Greece from meat so that's why I asked\n'em so somebody had like a ... or a concrete patio and the grease can't honor gas grill spilled um you can take this ACT cleaner sprinkle it on there it goes on it's a white powder and you just leave it alone you don't touch it\nAnd it might take three days it might take two weeks but that enzyme will actually eat that Greece out of that concrete\nAnd the white powder will just disappear also and um you know or you can get that only on the Internet and its ACT cleaners dot com\n[noise] um but that's an option not cheap but it's a it's a wonderful product for getting rid of any type of grease stains on concrete or would surfaces\nAlright thank you

Can't I Can't remember last week besides last winter but I think less what it was kinda chilly we had some pretty cold when I think we got below zero in our neck of the ...\nMy garage never go below forty degrees I get the little you know their stuff to come in for that but I never got below forty degrees amazing\nIn in ... you think about well you know my garage what do I care about the temperature in the garage well first off when you get in your car do you want it to start up right away do you want it to be struggling pipes do you want your pipes to freeze your\nBeer and the ... you know if you're in the garage that you don't want to bother those sorts of things can happen and those are important things not they have a right so now but in all seriousness the a ... a pipes freezing as a real\nConcern and there's a lot of pine earning garages and if you're having insulated garage door you're going to have far less likely probability of ah those those guys ... years ago when I was dating my ... my my my my job was to insulate those pipes and that garage\nWas old wooden door and pipes run across the ceiling\nIn may and those things would freeze every year we don't really get those didn't care then my job was to fall so now that I was thinking when you're talking now is probably not even a problem if you had a really good insulated ... is it different qualities of ...\nThere are a yeah you can get a a poly ... that's the same type of insulation and having those uh phone cuts might use ... and then there's polyurethane orange ... that's the big one yes aren't tele core garage doors used that polyurethane a phone\nAnd what that does is that gets in all the nooks and crannies and it's\nIt's a higher our values so it's a it's going to keep the cold out the warm in better than anything so yeah that's our until the court product line and it's going to be the top of the line when it comes to insulation\nSo we always talk about the beauty adores would ears are but the real bones how effective it is and how warm it keeps your garage which in effect with and keep your house that warm that really plays that's that's a that's a key if somebody has an old steel ... or ... would door\nRight yeah it's not I mean having the ... the base of a quality insulated product is important and then the aesthetics for sure is something that we uh we definitely focus\nSo I had a one of your a big dealers or bill every door on last Saturday and we're talking about yeah we're talking about getting that door ready for winter doors breaking January\nMan yeah you know one thing people don't realize is um springs need to be replaced it's you know cars when they you know there's certain things that you need to do every so many miles in a spring replacements one of those things too so in the winter\nAs the metal gets more brittle because it's cold um that's when things like that can wear out and that's that's something I Know a bill Weber and his team to a good job or placing those uh those springs when there's issues there and that's something that you want to watch out\nFor you find a good good door contractor and let them do once over going into winter\nNo doubt the key is to find a a reputable dealer or a ... there is as good as they come for sure um but if you're in a different part of the country what you want to do is you want to find someone\nThat is on the you know I'm Better Business Bureau or another thing to consider is an ID A member that's our industry so that our industry is I'm backing them\nUm and you can also go to ...
