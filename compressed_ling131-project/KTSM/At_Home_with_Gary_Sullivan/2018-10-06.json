{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "So another interesting watch story was um a couple of came in a few minutes ago\nShe's from El Paso she knows about us and our reputation\nAnd she came in with her boyfriend who just came into town from California and he brought her watch and he said I just came in from California I'm I brought her oh I'll watch and she wanted me to size it so I did and when I did it now it's not working\nSo my first thought was do be a do it yourself watch repairman do ... do it yourself battery replace or you can cause more trouble than it's worth now it was a law in jeans I'm actually you can cause more trouble than that it's going to cost you a lot of money to fix\nSo launches is not an inexpensive watches the knife Swiss watch I took a look at it and sure enough it wasn't I'm running so I said uh did you buy it new and he said yes and he told me where he bought it\nAnd I said well these are the problems\nI put it on my ah we have a lot of sophisticated watch equipment here one piece we have is where we can put a watch on it we can tell without opening it if the battery is good or not but it doesn't always work with curves surfaces and this watch had a curved crystal\nSo I couldn't really get a signal to know if it was the battery or not\nThe other thing is is when you buy a new watch it usually comes with a warranty\nThe warranty warranties usually stayed that if anybody else opens the watch the voids the warranty\nSo I told them look I can fix it for you are but if it's good to be a major problem then you're better off taking it back to California and turning it back into the store and telling them that you just bought it and it's not working\nAnd so sure enough that's what they decided to do which was really the best thing is just spent all this money buying this watch and he gets here to give it to his girlfriend and sure enough it's not working now that's also a problem with dealing with\nUm companies out of out of town or again the Internet or people that you don't know who they are\nBecause of that when you have a warranty issue you have to send it back you have to wait ... it could take weeks and weeks and weeks\nAnd here he wanted to surprise there and when he surprised or he could she couldn't even where although I did recommend and she agreed that she'll just where it all day long and enjoy it and then she'll give it back to him when\nHe leaves and uh he can go take it back\nNow the same thing happened with someone that came in that said that two months ago they had a new battery put in\nAnd now it's two months later and it's not working\nSo it could be a million reasons and I've talked about this before but I'll give it to you quick\nFirst of all the battery could have discharge uh we maintain that we only use batteries the best quality batteries and the ones that are six months old or less so we know they have been discharged\nSecondly it could be that they put the wrong battery and we had to come in this past month or that had the wrong batteries in it that they smash the wrong batteries in there and one of them even cracked the um dial on the watch [noise]\nSo that's the second the third thing is it could not be a battery problem\nIt could be a movement problem and so if that's the case then putting new batteries in will keep it going but not for a long time what are some of those issues some times the a movement starts\nSucking out energy too much energy from the battery so he uses it up quicker and that's what we find most of the time if a battery gets used up if they say oh we just\nPat the battery replaced and it's now dead again that that can be the problem now cleaning might be necessary a maintenance where they do like a tune up on the watch that's more expensive to do but it needs to be done every three to five years\nWhether you like it or not if you have a good watch and you want it to last for a long time\nYou need to do that service\nDo put it off because in the end it's like going to cause more damage\nThan if you um did it every ah three\nThree years or five years\nAlso when you are if you decide to do it yourself battery changer\nYou need to have the right tools and you need not to touch the watch battery with your hand\nThe watch makers tell us that the grease on your hand is not a good thing and you should hold it with tweezers\nSo I could go on and on and on about fixing watches that have been damaged in other places\nAnd um but for right now that's what we're gonna talk about for today except for one last story and that is that sometimes people by watches and they drop 'em or they do things by mistake but they're not covered under warranty crystals or one of those things\nUh impact damage is what they call it if you drop it and it if we could say because there's two ways that we can the first week of the if there is a gash\nThe on the case or on the crown or on the band you could see where it hit ... you can check like if it's on the bestseller close to the crystal if it's chipped\nAnd third the watch makers can go in and they can see if parts in the watches are bent\nThey could be banned or out of line there's a lot of balance wheels and things inside of a watch that have to be totally straight up or perpendicular and when they're bent they know right away that it's been a hit and that that's what's causing the problem\nSo when you come back in and say oh it's under warranty and they find that then that's not covered\nSo I wanted to go back to talking a little bit about the event coming up I'm On Wednesday October tenth I'm with a professor Gary buyer who's an expert on cyber estate planning and a administration\nAnd if you haven't ever thought about your passwords and use their names and all those things if right now you would sit down and write 'em all down and put them in a file tell somebody where they are that would be a huge huge um a gift\nFor your executive or or for the next generation coming up because the last thing they last thing they have time to do is to go hunting around for that or then contacting the company and finding out that the company won't give you that information\nNow there's a lot of other things that will be posting on our website about estate planning about your checking account and going to the bank and all kinds of things many of you probably already have very excellent attorneys that handle your estates CPAs\nPeople like that but just in case you don't there might be some new things if you haven't gone to them in the last three to five years there's always new things and the latest thing is about username and password and all these things\nThat can cause grief when you're not around to tell them where these things are\nNow the same thing happens with hiding jewelry and money\nSo many people tell me when they [noise]\nGet jury bad just hearing you coming down to drill modern house\nOr do you are you\nLearned out

be able to remove it because no blues really involved\nIn the stomach so I I Would try the lentil into water loose and cleaner\nOkay and that um to me I you know at work where we have it\nI'm sure you could just go the hardware store automotive show that I asked for wireless hand cleaner or the the brand name is Joe Joe\nJoe yeah okay\nWe did try something a handyman hours of tried to stay put on it to let it ring dissolve it and that was a long time ago I Can't remember what was that it was a liquid that you had around the house and it just\nIt didn't really seem to make any difference so\nI Hope we don't run into the same thing\nYeah I mean that is a good product for exactly what's your issue with ... um I've even way back in the day a lot of people for that type of brokers you just put mayonnaise on it\nOh okay and again with the vegetable oil ... softening up a bit okay but I feel a little better with the uh uh Leyland but if you get some mayonnaise you try that\nOkay and then the other thing was thank you um [noise] we have a a outlet in the bathroom that wasn't working it's our only outlet for everything and and so they a friend or that the handyman\nReplace you know put a brand new one and you know you got the little button and ... and the metal that you press when it hops off and and go back on again the little red like Amazon and all that [noise]\nUm so you know that for several months it's been great and\nThen all of a sudden this week and it went off again and it won't come back on the little red like Amazon you press the button but nothing worked when you plug it in and it it's over a hundred year old house ... ... and I'm really afraid that maybe there's something in the wall\nThat is a problem instead of just the Atlanta area and we also get someone to come in a professional to really yeah check it out yeah\nUm and and that may be the case so\nI'm ... I don't know how that outlet is wired for a lot of times we always we blame that outlet\nFor them but really in effect it's doing its job and I know when it got kind of like a building circuit breaker when it detects a short or straight electricity it shut off off yeah and I had one quite honestly that would go off and it turned out\nIt was wired were protected not only that outlet but it protected numerous other outlets down the line and I had an outlet that was on the outside of the house that was kind of on that same branch and it was it was outside in the weather proofing plate\nOr the ... the part that was the weatherproof seemed a little something it disintegrated\nAnd it was getting moisture in there which was causing that whole circuit to go out and it wouldn't reset Mm So I don't know how they borrowed it whether it's just that particular thing mhm um or there's another outlet that is um you know causing the problem\nYeah I'm getting a ... but I Would have to check or a Christian man yes Gen our crime that I Will\nCertainly have that checked out and see what's ... what's going on there yeah 'cause\nI I don't know why that little red light would be on but you plug in things and it's not working I mean to me that indicates okay fine because it popped out a couple of times recently like that um it makes me worry\nAnd you've got circuit breakers in the house yeah and the circuit breakers on ... yeah it was nothing went on nothing went off it's just that outlet yeah\nYeah well there's something that's all we allow him to do that either a shorter moisture or something along those lines whether it's just that outlet ... or other another outlet that's causing the problem which you'd have to track down mhm um I Can't answer but I Am good thing if it's been a trouble spot probably not a bad idea to get it checked out\nYeah and I'm worried about fire but we don't have any thing we can do it like the ... in that room talents arming bathroom so\nYou know loose wires can cause it so yeah you know you need to check it out it's really not that outlet it's probably something that's causing that outlet to do what it's designed to do yeah\nOkay All right that's right I Want it to All right do you do say you buy buy her eight Fifteen minutes after the top of\nThe hour and Ron Wilson he's up next we'll continue your at home with Gary seller\nDo have a list of things to do around the house Gary will find something for you one eight hundred to three saw your at home when Gary ...\nUse radio station id came down and [noise]\n\n\nIt's\nNo secret that at least in your guttural cause clauses inexpensive water damage to keep your gutters flowing and reduce cleaning with the easiest leaf guard I've used interested for years it's gutter brush just light three foot section in your gutters and leave him there for effect of affordable protection\nYou can install yourself no tools cutting or faster is needed request to free sample in order it good or brushed dot com or call eight eight eight three Ninety seven Ninety four thirty three main USA and guaranteed gutter brush dot\nCom have found a premium ... last the next year Caesar to versus the other ... it's called the fire stream which again it's the state of the art acrylic technology has fortified with the special sunscreen technology that's why it lasts longer\nA father directions ... year use your special clean room would brighten your you enjoy that additional season or two you can buy defy stream which tainted do at best stores or find\nOther dealers and watch the videos go to defy would stain dot com it's premium that last I've found the decorating unlike anything on the market today decorators bald is new composite decorating it contains no wood\nFiber so bold stain or fate it's made up of durable polymer that gives it on my strength plus a woman absorb water and it can withstand any climate in looks terrific decker is vault is backed by twenty five years structural twenty five years they invade in twenty five year removed one replacement limited warranty including installation in ground or water\nDoesn't get any better than that by the dealer ed decorators dot com that decorators with the gay listen if you've ever been away from home in a storm and worried about your some pop I've got good news dollar pumps to create a battery backup system that you can check from your mobile device\nThe awkward not active fiber weight D.C battery backup system was controlled technology it periodically checks to make sure your system is ready to go and you can run a test from your phone\nI Love it great peace of mind bill was dollar quality Asher plumbing pro to install the awkward not five oh wait active\nMerrill nice veterans showing how stupid and know a career\nI was Airforce from Ninety three Ninety eight that got hurt\nCombat search and rescue ...

LB welcome\nGood morning Gary his or a my\nQuestion is the one L v the flooring um I Would like to I'm going to pull up the um laminate that in my basement and I want to replace it also in my master and the kids that are all ... um\nI guess my question is thickness I'm available to you I noticed that there are\n... for me to little information on what I should be looking for as far as where I understand that but where is one thickness but then there's the thickness of the the uh the blanket fell so and I wanted to use the the um the clicking go not\nThe glue now mhm so are you asking me what sickness is the best or where\nI get for residential like ... I I notice I think twelve meal of the lowest to\nA millimeter I'm at the end of high I Know that I've seen that commercial break and go as high as ... I guess what's good for residential\n... tell me how uh where's it going again and how many people in the household and all that uh\nThere were five of us all I'd like to put it in our basement and um 'cause I'm redoing our basements while at like the pull up the um the laminate down again go with that it will be the so it's five of us in the house um it'll be\nMore for recreational use down there and then the master bathroom where my wife and I and and\nI'm so normally I wouldn't go anything less than twelve mill guy that that that's number one I I kind of like the commercial grades in high traffic area is\nUm is especially like uh you know maybe like a basement recreation area um again the inexpensive stuff in there like every product line there there's junk out there and you start getting into you know\nEven four five six meal and then you started sliding a refrigerator over or something you're gonna have problems with the separation on it\nOr that way so I don't have time for a cold winter ...\nOh yeah yeah I can use it you spray it on the next couple of weeks you'll be absolutely fine\nOh okay and what kind of feel or should I say\nWell the sealer you want to make sure you get a good breed the bulls sealer so again we're always recommended one called a brand name as masonry defender and it's a driveway and sidewalks sealer\nOkay thank you very\nVery good thank you take care and that's a good project it really is this time of year perfect ... get it down and it's going to take you know five six weeks it'll start to light ... and then all of a sudden it's affected the full story I did this on my driveway apron\nI did it in the springtime and um it was all cub black teach\nAnd I was sprayed the wedding forget on it and that is funny outta sight outta mind it's not like I was obsessed with it where I kept going out every three days and looking at it\nBut I didn't at all actually\nAnd uh about two or three months went by and I was born in the driveway one day in and what\nThat's all gone [laughter] I mean and that is the way it works it just is all gone and it takes the sunlight the rain and everything else to get rid of it but it'll work quite nicely Kay welcome\nHigh on to crash and I every time we get a really heavy rain I have water thinking into my tenure blocked off in one corner of it they crawl space and then I get these really late fall over to match the down the drain\nOn anything I can stop it from coming in\nSo I didn't hear the part that comes over and falls into the drought\nAnd yeah it's across the state that thought four feet at and it's got it and then four and they're very clean\nAnd but I can kind of looking at the Senate blocked with a flashlight I can see their stance on it flying now that where it's coming in and then you get all the time the concrete floor of the space and then it gets over the edge it across state come on the regular flowing down the drain\nSo you want to just keep water from getting into the crawl space is there are some bumps in the cross space\nAnd now I don't need when a kid like little teeny recognizing that there are I don't know what a ...\nWhere if you pour a lack of water on something and it'll have like a couple of little river coming down rather than in ...\nOkay um\nWell to stop water from coming you got to give it a pass the path of least resistance so right now the path of least resistance is going through the wall and you have access to water now is it coming through the walls are coming up where the floor in the wall beat\nA wrong block yeah okay so is there a got her on that side on the outside yeah everywhere and they're not clogged now and the down spouse where do they empty\nUh there's one in that corner and it goes underground\nAnd Gary are you sure that's free flowing all the way in removing all that water away from the house\nI think I mean from what they make it I can think\nWell that's what I Want you to check 'em because you know it it didn't leak before substance changed and are actually\nIt was like ... bought the house eight years ago and okay\nSo houses so there's there's three things that are causing the water and there it's either the gutters the groundwater the grading on the outside of the house so we got to make sure they're all functioning to start with the gutters make sure they're\nYou know free flowing in all cleared out and unless you're going up there during a rainstorm with an umbrella and watching where the water from the down spouse exit out that pipe\nI can assure you don't know if it's free flowing or not so next time it rains that's what you need to do the second thing is you want to make sure that the soil is slope away from the house gay\nOr you know we have the over\nAnd a half and the overhang that several people that I always try to water\n... when it's raining there yeah uh-huh and and is there any tips or ... or anything of the uh [noise] how about the uh pipes going around that house and we had water\nYeah we have to go there ... former [laughter] right get going down that corner but it's a white piping there I Know\nThat it'll be an act\nBut is it underground no background what good is doing a book\nOr I don't know [laughter] personally time on his hand rather I mean they're really\nDoing any good above the ground so you know there is what they call it underground French drain a that would go around the perimeter which it moves the water away\nI'm so and do some up I mean if you're looking for a quick cure or I don't know if there is one if you can get somebody net crawl space and put a waterproof pain on that wall like a product like dry locked that'll certainly I'm ... years seal that wall\nAnd make it more difficult for the water to get in\nA to Z crawl space itself so you'll still that wall up\nThe question mark then becomes where does that water go and does it cause any more damage\nSo I Would um you know if you're looking for a quick easy solution or go ahead and put some dry luck on that wall but keep your eyes open to make sure that uh is incoming somewhere else\nInto that house but the three keys to getting water out of the basement I'm telling you is gutters\nGroundwater in grading they're called the killer jeez so you're kind of telling me all those are just fine and you still have that problem so maybe sealed up with some dry lock and hopefully that'll take care of the problem if it's a simple easy to solve problems maybe it will [noise] All right\nThanks much for the call okay I appreciate it [noise]\nUh one of my all time
