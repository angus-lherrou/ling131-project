{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "I Can't believe how many people do them that have no training that tell you they can do them and\nHave very very little training and especially no specialized training from the brands that they're fixing\nFor instance most of the top brass like brightening omega all of them have um classes that they give to watch makers because there's so many brands and so many movements in so many changes in so many styles that if you learned all of them Twenty years ago you would be out in the cold today\nWhen it comes to learning about gems and jewelry watches gold\nArt all those kinds of things require major amount of dedication time experience an education\nSo you know I'm big on education and as I mentioned in my last show I went to the Harvard Business seminar and now we're implementing a lot of things that we learned over there trying to help get the word out to you a little bit more about what we do and what's important to us\nAnd of course knowledge is very important to us\nSo one of the unusual things that have happened that people have brought in our things that are engraved and you might think that engraving is very important but let me tell you something\nEvery time a person looks at the piece of jewelry that has been grading on it it brings back all the memories associated with that piece for instance if it says love Sandra in your wedding band and your wedding date\nIt brings a warm feeling to your heart when you look at it and besides that it also makes you aware every year when your anniversary is so you can never forget it\nBut just a yesterday a piece came in a very unusual piece it was a watch uh Gerard pair ago which is a small very high end watch company that makes beautiful watches\nAnd on it it had one of those Indian style watch bands that are made by Indians is when didn't have any ... just all silver and then it had the expandable back so that you could put it on without opening a class\nBut that wasn't what was unusual because we see those Indian or Native American silver watch fans on a lot of things\nWhat it was was the engraving on the back and there was a lot of engraving and it said something to my son and grandson with all my love always the date and grandpa on it\nWell every person that gets that watch is going to know the history behind that watch now unfortunately watches count last forever but there are ways that we can make them live longer in other words if the guts of the watch\nBecomes extinct and you can't get parts or you put the parts in and they're not working then most of the time we can find a a current movement to put in there that we can guarantee\nThe problem is sometimes we can't sometimes the size of the watch the options the difference of things that the watch does sometimes there is no watch available and in that case we can take the watch and display it or we can make something else out of it [noise]\nI Know that last week I was talking about these unusual gold pebbles that came in ...\nBecause of what I talked about on the radio I decided to make a page on my Web site that's called unusual request and so you'll see some of the unusual request\nThat we have had and some of the\nUnusual things that we do and so if you have an old watch that um say belong to your grandmother or great grandmothers some of these old ones that have diamonds on them but they're very very tiny most of those cannot be fixed they're not in style and most of the time people don't wear them anymore\nHowever we can do a lot with them we can redesign them we can take the diamonds out we can re purpose and then we can make them into bracelets\nWe can do a lot of things and get your money out of it or we can try to sell it on consignment or try to buy it from you so that we can use the parts and make things\nFor our customers or for our red carpet a collections that we make\nSo don't let anything go to waste you know jewelry should never go to waste it should have ... we can always do something with it it's it's kinda like leftovers only they lost a lot longer\nUm you can always re make it a redesign it or sell that are invested or do something else like that and that reminds me of a person who came in yesterday and told me that he it diamonds aren't important to him and he wanted to buy an engagement ring but he only wanted to spend five hundred dollars\nAnd I couldn't didn't really have too many things in that price range but I did find something for a thousand that he could use and uh that way I explained to him why diamonds\nHave the ... the value that they do diamonds don't have value just because\nThey're ... the reason they are an engagement ring is the rich history of the diamonds and how they were formed in the earth billions of\nYears ago and how all these things had to be in place for the diamond to form and that how they are each one is different not no two diamond said the same they're part of nature\nAnd how important it is that the diamond carries the emotion for the person so that they can um no that that means lifetime commitment and so diamonds are really important but they can chip and they don't last forever\nAnd so sometimes when people bring in jewelry that they want to sell we see the chips and some of the marks\nOn the diamonds and that lowers the value to us but it may not to them because it represents the history behind [noise]\nThe watches so I Hope you've learned a lot for me today I look forward to being with you next week at twelve thirty but next week I'll be at

money issue I have a metro bathroom that we were out to the studs took out the whole floor and all nine yards\nAnd when it was about a little over a year ago and when we were traced everything including the ... floor it crowds out and we had to have to come to come back we're off the floor and regretted and trailing again and the ... problem is that the cap Robin\nCook who else has a new flooring\nWhat kind of ground is it a powder ground you're mixing with water yeah okay\nAnd um is it the ceramic tile tell me about the ceramic tile size of the ceramic tile\nUm twelve inch okay square yes square okay and how about the uh the ... floor that you're putting it on what's that\nAh that are only the house owner didn't put it in myself so I'm not I know they actually replace the ... for the second time too so I imagine it's some sort of\nA tourist membrane yeah so it's a my guess is is not the ground and it's not the tile it's the stability of the ... floor um whenever there's any kind of movement the first thing to fails to grab the second thing to fail the tile\nGotcha um had this problem when I had a home bill\nThat was actually on\nVacation when they put the floor and and uh two years later I started seeing a crack in the grout pulled the register cover off and I looked at the ... floor the wood was fine and it was I Can't remember say five base\nA always be me me and I can't even remember and then it was a quarter in cement board and I remember ... as soon as I saw it I I ... that had to be ... board\nAnd um I had to foreign company come back and then by the time in between our phone calls the towel it actually correct in one spot 'cause I was just there was there was bouncing that some sort of there wasn't enough stability there and they had to tear everything up replace the cement born in the whole works\nSo quick you know you kind of get an idea of kind of what you're looking for and then you're gonna have to\nHave somebody out there to see how it's going to match up to the house okay because it has so many ways to vent different types of fire places now I tell you one thing I was at home not long ago they had a coal burning fireplace and they had a pellet stoves I don't know if you know what those are\n... and it was a direct vent right through the back of that and it was really kinda fits motif for the house\nBecause ... come in all different kinds of sizes so I think I Would just going to block out the whole uh gas log thing first\nEh let's see what's available in terms of pellet stoves aimed gifts loved combs those too I'm In the direct vent\nAnd a kind of kind of figure out you know what's in your price range how's it going to line up to the house and go from there we're kind of backwards\nOh okay see I thought they were on\nYou have an opinion on like a vet was a logs or or stoves versus\nYeah direct thing I I'm not a fan of the vent lists never have been people that swear by him a but you're asking my opinion I'm not a fan of it yeah I think a direct van is much better\nOkay All right fair enough\nAlready figured All right Tony thank you take care Bye bye yeah there are so many very cool things you can do and if you're not familiar with the old coal burning fire places I mean I doubt if they're twenty four inches deep they're ... they're probably more like a Fifteen inches deep\nSo it's not like a big fire bucks oh a stove and a drug vent or you know which you can get with a gas loves them which you can give us a ... really ideal for that situation but see what's out there and it kind of work your way back and I think you'll get your answer um let's see go to Colleen Colleen welcome\nThat morning I Am a problem with glass windows and my foundation ... at first I thought\nSomething was hitting them but it's not from Milan or they're not doing anything but the surface of the glass on the outside is chipping off what's causing that\nHave no idea where they chipping\nWell just just all

primary ... use of paint with a primer so you kind of double priming yeah um but what happens sometimes and just you know just so you know\nUm sometimes additional weight will actually in the in the moisture actually help remove paper\nI'm less so with vinyl of vinyl is\nMore of a slick material so the challenge here is to making sure that it doesn't feel from the vinyl and doing the bonding primer and then to paint with a primer\nWill usually take care of that [noise] so\nDid you how'd you how'd you do on the uh how'd you do on painting the paper paper\nOh absolute a mid ... trip uh I I run or two after there's a lot of work because of all Trump prep for faint probably thought to stay there and it was well done uh probably we pay but I used a dry wall mud on the same\nHand it to make sure it was it was ... and ... and everything was tied put a kill\nCoat [noise] mhm and then primer and then put a coat of paint eggshell finish didn't get a single Bob\nNow and it was absolutely thrilled with that and they had been promoting the violent of the kitchen ... took a lot of prepping almost as if you were prepping any wall yeah gosh track and I bought in that big master bath I Would be great\nAnd paid for by paper always paint a little better than the vinyl um I mean there's paper on drywall right so so it it always paint job better than the vinyl the vinyl sometimes says a little bit of a texture to it yes uh the drywall compound is less likely to stick to it\nSo there's a little bit more challenges with that but if you got a really good tight seems and you wash it real good and it doesn't have a texture to it and you put a primer on you probably do All right I just hate to ever guarantee it because you never know you know it's that one a variable\nThat's right well

want to update you with the conversation I had with\nGail just to let you know uh what we're dealing with day after we spoke off the air one of the things that I'm a originally when she was talking that maybe there was something wrong with the pain and I said well jeez you know there's usually I'm I don't know how much older than anything could be attributed to the pain itself\nAnd she contacted the representative and\nUh what was determined to that point when it wasn't drying as they may have used the wrong color and\nIn the solid color stain which was which makes sense that it wouldn't dry\nColor and for the most part and I'm Talking about generic color and the Jews them ... or done they have drying features which would extend the drank time which could allow for other sports to get entangled in the sticky pain which could cause the growth now\nShe's talking about using all kinds of clear she talked about a thirty second cleaner which is a good cleaner I'm so that didn't work at all um use the wedding forget and that was about five weeks ago so sometimes a wedding forget to include the temperatures extends the\nActive time so I don't think that was really given enough time to really work\nOr wherever we kinda left it is pursuing it through the bank company but in the meantime getting just a good grade of oxygen they bleach work on a smaller and scrub it see if we can remove it\nFrom there because at this point where we have issues with\nThings around our house we don't know what that is when she was first talking one of the things and I didn't mean address this with their um and it didn't sound like it would be this but uh it it could be in some other cases um when you have mulch and maybe the sap and new hardwood mulch\nEspecially inexpensive hardwood mulch spread around your home\nThere is um [noise] a byproduct of that I guess I guess that's where you would say it is a cold artillery fungus or shotgun fungus\nSo as a mulch breaks down it shoots these hard spores all over the wall on in glass I've seen them cars it's virtually impossible\nTo remove literally\nAnd if even if you were looted with a razor blade ... off the glass or something to leave a little yellow stain\nNow I don't think that's what her as she was I'm not really sure exactly what that issue was because we don't know what's on it we don't know what that stain or you know what's on it at all so we've had a couple of mysteries today\nAnd sometimes you just got to dig deeper deeper deeper I left with her like she needs to work it through the pain company in the store for the wrong tent was used that could have implications on many things on the outside of the house outside of just not drawing properly alright\nEight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab a line happened to take your calls as we marched through another weekend Sheila welcome\nHey Sheila hello yes I Am I really amazing we play\nMy neighbor just had his room playing Don ...\nHouses were built with [noise] ah they had metal valleys and I knew that his\nCook first layer of um [noise] show and put on and went down and then some kind of\nI don't think of something and then he put the new high up on everything but by Kyle ...\nWho have told them they don't use the um metal valleys anymore and that caused problems and they're not as good I I'd never heard that before so I came to you\nWell it's called a California we have\nAnd uh your roofers wrong they do use metal valleys they still use metal valleys of galvanized and paying them they use copper valleys in in my opinion I think those valleys are actually better\nUm versus the California we've uh California we've used by a lot of roofers but um\nYou know my opinion is I kind of like the middle valleys that doesn't mean you have to have him that's just my opinion not\nI'm not I'm not in that group of about before I went to look for a decade I Want to know hey\nWe only have one layer of child for takeoff shingles I made her take off all the shingles it don't cut the shingle on top of an old one because they make them into [noise] um you\nCan put a second layer of shingles on top of an existing layer of shingles and it'll save you a little bit of money um I kind of go back to the thing is I probably wouldn't do that\nI'm a first of all a lot of roof worn teaser avoided if you go over and an existing layer of shingles okay I'm also a ...\nIt's always good to check what's going on underneath those shingles in case she had some water damage or something maybe some would needs to be replaced it doesn't give you a smooth the look and you're saving a little money but it's ... it's a little money it's not ...\nBut he didn't tell them about taking the original shingle off and putting on the mall was correct yeah alley stuff\nI'm going to talk to the people I hear 'em before I talked to anybody I wanted to talk to you and make sure that I got some um\nYeah and you and you bring up a really good point to Sheila because I'm I'm you know some refers to the California weave in and swear by it okay but you know I'm saying I like the middle valleys in the reason having these conversations is it's all about the quality of the roof or you\nKnow that other roof or he was good to he was saying Gees I wouldn't put it over the old layer I really recommend stripping absolutely but I always say there's people ask me all the time what's the best shingle I said don't don't worry about single worried about the roof or get the best route for you Ken\nOkay now the next question what is the ban in the valley ... but the California\nI I'm not really sure I can tell you what the advantages it's more long lasting is more ... it's less I'm more susceptible to being intact if
