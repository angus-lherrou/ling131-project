months ago\nAbout how dangerous it is\nFor an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat there is no more loyal partisan\nVoting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but there's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party than African Americans especially for American women\nSome as diamond in silk about that but what happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday\nAnd CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously and racially using pejorative racial terms racism attacked Kanye West\nBakari sellers is a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina now he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nStories you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote Donald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier\nWho's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an African American woman talking quote black folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him\nHe's an attention whore like the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator\nSaying number one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Tanya the racial draft they had it with him hey she's spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her and and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take Conyers seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog eat dog he said it's not called Tom\nAnd so entertainers\nComics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas and Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell\nAnd Benjamin Carson in ... and others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on\nBack for the past half century Ninety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest\nThe Democrats have consistently opposed go choice trapping kids and failing public schools for generations they've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration\nWhich is destroyed black working class jobs and champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led the massive levels of unemployment in black communities they've also Democrats who crippled the black families by and bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples who get married it goes on and on and\nOn and this was all said and the sense to CNN's Don Lemon\nWho laughed with venomous ... at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr use other racial pejorative against them they would be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWith CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves\nThe Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan as a terrorist arm of the Democratic party to intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy\nAny political activities of the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy tests\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats\nBecause his sample shouldn't media like CNN and ABC NBC and CBS control black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control we have well I watch free thinking African American men and women be personally destroyed by CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party\nAnd so then I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low criminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West is the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas to Jessie Molly Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line\nThey're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon and they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed against a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints\nThat is why CNN working with the Democratic party much destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks\nWe'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party has done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional\nThe black family is completely broken\nThere's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West steps out of line him against their expressed support for a different political outlook\nHe has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book\nBecause it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in law and they want to dissuade other African American men from thinking an acting independently of the Democratic party that is cause such harm can you think a worst cities to live in\nOne control by crime\nPoverty single mothers academic failure racial inequality that is the result whether whatever black city it is controlled by Democrats what occurs when you think\nAbout how badly the Democratic party treated blocks the relevant question isn't y con you realize that but why others have not realized why even more black voters had the same ... funny as Kanye West why as it happened yet well maybe it is 'cause right now\nTheir stories started in

would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nomination so what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good\nBut we made a great deal with a with

of Trump is negative I think it's higher than that I I don't recall with all these great things happening the mania objectively covering the Trump Administration give me fifty fifty somebody's talking the other day and said why do you think it is CBS NBC ABC\nOr the New York times Washington Post every big city newspaper Hollywood movies too late night comics are all one way and and I said I I guess it's group think because they all live in either Hollywood or New York\nBut but can you imagine if CBS or ABC would say you know what we're going to go a different direction\nWe're going to start covering the news objectively we're going to have conservatives from top to bottom in America is a conservative country right thirty two states are controlled by ... a Republican governors house the Senate Supreme Court we are basically a moderate to right wing or conservative\nWhat if CBS would say from top to bottom or going to raise that we're going to reflect conservative values and cover the news objectively\nI think those of us who are normal would flock to CBS News and the ABC and NBC and CNN would take an alibi hit the only one that is conservative more or less right now is Fox into him near leaning left quite often were Shepard Smith and people like that\nAnd you see what the ratings have Hannity are every night John draws about four million viewers every night so those kinds of the interviews I just conducted was their regular event on CBS Evening news or ABC I give up any hope for NBC\nThose ratings would double and triple\nAnd it would become the dominant evening

in Mexico may not be right in the south Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because after was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of it used to what happened over here with all you still have\nBuildings empty with just everybody moved out I don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said that's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south\nKorea so we're friends how many jobs and talking to my retirement account or Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to
