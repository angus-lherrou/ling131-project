Know what they were going to have more I got this\nTime of it I Know we can lay out the case for hours look they were stolen for two weeks\nFor simple reason they had Meryl Streep give their acting lessons you know someone like Meryl Streep has been co chair and co chairing coach you are probably a team of five people coaching for two weeks to make sure that she was so monotone and so calm it's like they had to run for dean and they act like a little girl I mean would that that Senator Whitehouse\nI Swear to God I thought he was gonna say do you like a lollipop ... little girl because she was so calm and he was being so nice store and here's the big problem the Republican Party is\nFilled with ... and ... now there's a couple of New York where it's\nMosques and puts his who were scared to death their own shadow not one Republican mail center white male center was willing to interview a woman for the thought they'd be called sexist racist than thousand other words\nBy liberal they gave it to a woman a woman prosecutor named Mitchell who is the single worst prosecutor I haven't seen in my entire like near you and I could have put this girl on the stand and you and I want to destroy the bill we would have had or just a apoplectic she wouldn't know what to say her entire case we've been ripped to shreds\nAbout five minutes and she couldn't get a decent question at home in getting around the five minute questioning\nShe couldn't get it out and you got to see using a true you fly all the time yes or no isn't it true now you told is Jimmy you needed a ten day break to be able to drive your he isn't it true that you will not give us that there is no she gave the Washington Post isn't it true you belonged yourself with a foreign ... most of your life\nIsn't it true not one single witness not know boy you said and the guy who came from you isn't there you go out there who\nIsn't it true that you said that in two thousand twelve you finally awake and and what your psychiatrist because you were redoing your house and that renovation about the security door is what made bring back memories of this attempted rape\nExcept there's a problem we checked your records and you built the house you did the renovation of two thousand eight not two thousand twelve you're a liar they could've said are you a democratic operative how many Democrats did you speak to who connected you at the top Democrat lawyers and George George lawyers\nTo get involved in this case they could have after a thousand questions they could've asked her ... you will they did after who paid for your lie detector tests and I don't know what do you mean you don't know where is the follow up question everyone knows ... why would someone do it for free the whole thing is ridiculous\nThey could've after about a thousand issues like a two thousand twelve when you claim out of the blue you enter repressed memory of rape\nIsn't it true that in two thousand twelve Mitt Romney named three potential people would be a Supreme Court nominees and one of them was Brett Kavanaugh is that how you came to know Brett Kavanaugh and isn't it true that Planned Parenthood two thousand twelve\nTook out ads in newspapers all over the country that said roe versus Wade make believe it was just overturned and they showed the pictures of the night Supreme Court justice\nAnd they replaced Ginsburg faced with Brett Kavanaugh and they said this is going to be Mitt Romney's Supreme Court nominee overturns roe versus Wade is that how you got to know his name have you decided to become a heroin or the left by making up a story I mean there's a thousand things they could have said is it true your father is CIA\nIs it true your grandfather was CIA [laughter] is it true your brother was working for a law firm that found a GPS fusion is that possible and you're not a democratic operative where all those questions\nHow bad is it true the bread Kevin O's mother a Marilyn said John trial judge Robert bonded over the foreclosure of your parents who do you call\nIt kept me on that one 'cause they claim it was never quite for closed on and they got the house back\nSo why she was a young girl she was standing in a in a courtroom singer parents being questioned by a judge\nThe judge and incredible power over at the future of her family's life and even though eventually they tend to lose out that's my understanding they did not lose the house and the judge actually in the end kind of rules for them it doesn't matter you may have developed a deep seated hatred for that judge and found out that that judges son is going to be Supreme Court nominee\nThere's a thousand things you could say the CIA one it's amazing that's not a conspiracy theory her dad CIA at her grandfather CIA at her brother is with a couple of it's with a law firm founded fusion\nGPS on all things considered this another deep state fraud conspiracy there's no other way about it there's no coincidence any of this stuff but having said all that listen let's forget all that\nFor a minute forget forget he gave the most\nBeautiful opening statement I've ever heard in my life I cried five times all my\nFriends cry I've spoken to fifty are more women on my radio show my TV show and letters to me over the last three days all sit they cry because they've got sons\nAnd they can't believe that there's some was crucified like this I Believe America's on Brett Kavanaugh side and I believe any pull you see that says ... says otherwise is another democratic ... job another lie another over sampling of Democrats\nI got a hundred letters today my column in the Vegas newspaper which was featured at real clear politics has one of the most important columns in America today over a hundred letters Ninety five percent of them were pro I Love your your great way and what you said about Brett Kavanaugh's fantastic\nAnd and I'm with you and five of them were liberals\nAnd all five of them in one way or another basically told me I Hope you get murdered or ... I Hope someone comes in murders you or one of them had a great line\nThey said I Hope this woman in your house and she grabbed the night the plunged into your head out and mentally disturbed or left is all they know how to do is talk about murdering people disagree with and then they call that's crazy I mean you're just dealing with sick people who will do anything\nAnd say anything because they believe\nOutlaw solid Lenski that the ends justify the means and that's why\nThis Christine for came forward and that's why the woman came forward and that's why the ... charge gang rape came forward and the next five women you hear about this week are all going to be liberal women wear pink vagina hats in March and anti Trump rallies who think they are saving the world by coming forward in line it's as\nSimple as that this guy is innocent he's a boy scout Jimmy Stewart is an easy Andy Griffith and made very are empty he's a fine man had what they did as a character assassination and they're sick people there's something wrong with all of them Democrats have men bill there's nothing else you could say we are targeting number one white\nStraight Republican men are the target of the Democratic party\nSip ... other provable fact in June of twenty sixteen Trump put on lose to twenty five judges that would be on his list\nFrom what you would pick one of those twenty five years in the U.S Supreme Court you might recall June July August that was a big deal with twenty sixteen she said that that uh because I'm Kevin O's name was on the Trump blitz during the campaign not also triggered some thought she had to come forward and do whatever\nIn reality ... Kevin O's name did not hit the Trump bliss until November a twenty seven dean more than one year after the election his name was known in the list for her to react to December twenty sixteen but the media doesn't boy that out either\nYeah lives in the best case I think out of all of those out of all I mean they're all damn name but the best one is that Dianne Feinstein knew about this in July if this was real how can anyone think it's real when they interviewed him one on one face to face and never mentioned that there's a woman claiming you attempted to rape or\nThey have that for the last days to see first if they might be able to beat him some other way and then this is going to be their last chance Hail Mary to try and destroy it\nBelieve when you watch the today that a few years ago his lungs her family and he was fighting to survive for\nEight hours a day someone was pounding on my chest to try and keep my lows clear I honestly don't think I have more than a couple of weeks to live that's when the\nProceeds the gift of life I double lung transplant made possible by an organ donor\nAfter I got my new lows I started doing things that I had never been able to do I never knew that breathing could feel is good\nHe climbs to honor his donor and to raise awareness to Oregon I and tissue donation\nWould only like that when you left this beautiful plant that you could save a few life and your way out in the new credible gift\nImagine when you can make possible by leaving behind the gift of life learn more and sign up as an organized tissue donor organ donor dot com message from the U.S department of health and Human Services how resources in services administration the website for detail\nHey I'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses why not getting anything\nThe only thing\nThat's what I'm doing my glasses and contact her pain and loss to finally get rid of these\nBut who can for lasik you can\nBecause some basic mission is to is offering dramatically low prices and an absolute free complication just wish to three five zero replies zero\nThe Lacey Peterson Institute has already perform over a million procedures they use the latest FDA approved lasik technology and helps the majority of patients a cheap twenty twenty vision fraction of what others jar better vision better value in the late sixties you didn't [noise] to to make this year you finally get lasik\nFor a free consultation plus an extra twenty percent discount leasing packages tax\nWent to three five zero five zero you see for free lipstick is right for you that I asked to three five zero free five zero\n[noise] I'm getting older one need to worry about falling\nYes you do every year one in four people sixty five and older will experience the song and many resulting serious injury [noise] the majority of falls happen at home to take a look around replied bold an ad lighting to help you the optical remove\nThing that can make you try and fix aren't even stuck on the floor and install handrail in bathrooms and downstairs consider balance or strength training exercises which can help with agility get your eyes and hearing shack regularly changes in your hearing can affect your balance\nPlease talk to your doctor or a ... you can take to help prevent a fall you can also visited a A R P foundation dot org or Medicare made clear dot com slash pong [noise] this message was brought to you by United healthcare and a A R P foundation [noise]\n\nWhere\nWorld around you use them for\nIt comes to news ... than store feeding your need to know for ... at the top and bottom of the hour\nLike to know what's going on in my locality\nEvents of the world a fairly so yeah I'm pretty connected more down the street\nFor the most part I Know what's going on you know I Need to be aware\nWhat's it look out for in some real cautious so yes I had what we do\nUse radio six Ninety two years damn views on the hour and a half trafficking whether all day stay informed with El Paso is news radio six Ninety KTBS them [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nReally cutting out a great American and it's always good to get a female perspective to the men and women are equal but somehow were different all they're making more than I generally\nThink pretty much the same of Reagan babe dot com also great radio talk shows in Las Vegas Nevada and Meghan bars welcome again to the bill Cunningham show Megan how are you\nA great Ballmer you\nGo I Want to get a woman's perspective I ... I Want to tell you what troubles me greatly about Thursday\nAnd then I Want to get your perspective and I I kinda look towards Fox News often as a place I can go to get conservative commentary and things of that character and ah after ah a doctor forwarded testified the the subtle Mike Wallace Chris Wallace said\nForge testimony is extremely emotional extremely Raul extremely credible\nNo uh no one could listener delivery delivery of those words and talk about these sold in the impact it at our life and not have your ... this was a disaster for the Republicans so started Chris Wallace Thursday Afternoon judge ended up ... generally I respect that I think Dr Ford is exceptionally credible\nKarl Rove the great political theorist that forward as the credible unbelievable\nSo when when I heard those commentaries I thought we were done and then I of course watch Brett Kavanaugh's testimony and they're still in as the Democrats show toward him Thursday Afternoon and everything flipped completely ... but when you have Chris Wallace\nAnd you have an Android Apollo Tono and Karl Rove saying that a woman who's credible\nWho providers witness names that turned out not to be witnesses at all when you have a Christine Ford straight up lying about her in capability of flying which you flew everywhere but every one of the witnesses re future story has no memory of the gathering\nAnd the woman who once anonymity to testify turn down the opportunity to be questioned in private and then we find out or lawyers never told her she had that opportunity at all so every time I tried to test her credibility making bart that turns out to be great grossly lacking\nSo when conservative commentator said she's believable she's credible and clearly she isn't it we completely lost our way\n[laughter] I think we think Karl Rove yeah completely lost our way because you are the ones telling us that Donald Trump never had a chance of winning\nThe people can see through it I think most people that I was talking to the to your testimony that the women and men\nI found ... cabinets people even though there was such a notion from falsely accused innocent man\nWho end up in the court of public opinion in the days leading up to this quote unquote hearing his life was completely turned upside down his wife with getting death threats\nAnd his career with looking because it's highly sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I do believe that something happened to her\nShe obviously has been in therapy for that age\nI she sat her so she has two front doors\nYou know anybody that has to car door bell no there's no snow\nSo obviously she had this you know it just because she says something happened doesn't happen and we have plenty of examples that or just because she starts Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she for that so far all start being out of it and\nIn fact if you presented us with a quarter of all in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge\nSmith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation to line or a light all who said I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it didn't get discount Marts judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did in ... her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know\nI don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well I I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the president being twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list\nFact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign about Brett Kavanaugh getting the Supreme Court what his name\nOne on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Rock Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know because ... ... exactly what were they watching\nAnd hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility or order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to be the Post's let me tell you something I wasn't given lawyers\nFrom the defensive side that treated me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal right on gender equality will you know what I was treated not as a woman that as a man as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nSo to watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired\nTreat her as she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poll calls and the many stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly than we find out she was all over the world",
