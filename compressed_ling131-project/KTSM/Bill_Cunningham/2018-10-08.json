it came out that they wanted to second door in their home and twenty oh eight four years before the therapy session because she wanted to provide an entrance to her therapist to conduct their business as a psychologist inside of her home\nShe also coached a friend about how to take a polygraph test she lied about that she also ah stole money from the boyfriend so all these things that she said Dr Christina forward simply fell apart and now yesterday or today\nHer lawyer Deborah cats came out to say that she doesn't want to pursue the Kavanaugh thing anymore really she's done with it so\nMedia

no one supporter and horror story either she gave for names the FBI they checked out the stories of ... Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job\nFor the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous antithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast light away from a weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed in fact here's a quote from\nSenator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular\nNot of the allegations raised by professor forward but at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it\nPublic statements of others that such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote\nSo said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham and I think Michael ... he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party and needs to keep doing it plus uh\nAs far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ...\n... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on ... spent on my show many times\nWrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning\nAbout supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those to promote the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it'd be it should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury sitting in a rape matter\nMy sympathy with the with the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified and she goes on to point out the number of times the Innocence Project and others have exonerated through late a DNA testing\nRape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory towns and Van Dyke Perry who's spending combine thirty seven years in prison on false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime\nAnd the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case\nIn which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from ... sure their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow students and twenty or not\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges but the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock\nOf American Jurisprudence this goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement these fires are not in competition to treat men\nFairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford they completely falling apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement and we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty those two principles are not in conflict except in the minds of Cory Booker\nKamala Harris and a senator her own uh of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports she could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that\nIn fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans\nAnd showing where we are Steven ... of the Late Show has a terrible late

steak\nBy a Senator Feinstein and others to make public private information that she wanted to keep private because she fit their diatribe it is unbelievable\n... and this writer for the CBS Evening show Stephen Colbert aerial Duma says it clearly quote whatever happens I'm just glad re ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life\nThey want it to ruin ... for the sake of ruining him because he didn't vote the way they wanted him to vote and he was nominated by Trump who they hate\nThat sums up the entire difficulties with Democrats they now try to dig out from their own rubble for the coming midterms suddenly they were woken the Republican conservative majority and now we're more energized to vote than we've ever been because the Democratic party has shown us their backside and it's an ugly backside\nLet's continue to take your calls we have thousands on hold millions are listening the heroes of this fight didn't think I'd ever say this Senator Susan Collins is a hero\nLindsey Graham is

to add to your show and\nNothing else comes close to the drama returned to our\nYou know quite frankly this\nIn the country\nNachos news radio six Ninety Katie as Sam used traffic weather and everything you need to stay informed\nI bet it coming on the great American I'm not I'm not felt this good in so many years I Can't stand them to rely upon Susan Collins\nAnd Lindsey Graham there'll be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold beginning tonight she was brilliant\nGoing over for forty five minutes why she was going to support then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like fly ball tactics have good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\nAnd and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees in the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of a Brett Kavanaugh was wiped his mom and dad is girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross a political correctness and title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen to get into title nine court and presumption of innocence cross examination of witness confronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply\nSo in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford\nOnce investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything for that fell apart including the four eyeball witnesses\nIncluding her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen therapists notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends and she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years but she ought to\nBut now a clowns fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett up and down the fame to run against or in Maine have asked\nLet's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call yesterday I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure yeah do you know the Democrats\nClaim to care about women but over the years or one of the largest supporters has been the pornography in the street I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why did they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael ... to porn lawyer and I I think you did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon that he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty\nCould we be that lucky Michael haven't had any run against ...\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know you look back to the Clinton years they did have one criminal parts should against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this you know bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nDuring the porn stopped a porn industry has given millions of dollars of the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing\nBabies in sub spaghetti women to lie for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenties interesting if they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and do you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because of you know the old effect of the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nWell or if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct but every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UVA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges\nFrom false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time but I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turned out to be a lie or misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen when she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth\nAnd she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist\nThat she was a attempted rape by four boys\nIn her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties and the reason it didn't fit Kavanaugh is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he moved to Connecticut so she had to\nTell the fib that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance\nYou are incentivized to tell the truth not going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she sat in twenty twelve that four boys tried to

you they're all coming up a little over an hour but Julie gun lock of the independent women's forum\nA woman's perspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man you might be a woman\nBut if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man your father was a man what kind of feeling step towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feeling step toward them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world\nWhere because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lives and every now and then a man is not guilty of rape or sexual assault happens all the time so you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up\nThere was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and one hundred percent acceptance on the other the fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do is a criminal defense attorney\nA take off my dad and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen or a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault I naturally want to believe that person but then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says\nThat person is due process rights because that is the rigorous\nReaction of substitutes every procedural due process that pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or confirmed and those that are lying or reject\nDemocrats never wanted to put professor Ford through a any rigorous process that determined that voice you were saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people got attacked or what had happened how it happened ... how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard the fearing the fly was ...\nAnd she lives in her boyfriend came out and said she was a faith\nInstead of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News after she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself now hold up on that car\nLet's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate\nThe two front doors was either a misrepresentation or ally because the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because\nA small business owner a therapist want it to rent a part of her house and she wanted a separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door\nAnd had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nAnd the boyfriend follows the affidavit saying wait for little planes all over French Polynesia and ... and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America South America and the euro she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said factually that turned out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth they had a ball face mitigated allegation\nThat could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe has mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and and the person with the Y chromosomes that's a liar but then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me\nWith the facts that's what caused a writer for the Kobe or CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the

people of constructive in ten a nice things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than the continued some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWith the communist
