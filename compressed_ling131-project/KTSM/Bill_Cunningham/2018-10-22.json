Korea or you are doing great how are you today\nDoing well you know about a week ago I spent some time with the president to privately it was wonderful you spent like\nHundreds or thousands of hours with the guy and I said on the air the other day that uh there there's a differential between what I see in the media sometimes with the president and how he truly is\nBefore we get on to so many issues going on especially the mobs versus jobs and all that kind of stuff you know give the American people a measure of the man himself\nWell you know I spent so much time with a then candidate Trump but now President Trump and a truly cares about other people he's extremely magnanimous and private he is funny he's gracious he's always asking about how my family is doing and what he can do to help me that your two years and if you listen to the media\nIs the worst human being on the planet help but the truth is he's exceptionally gracious I've seen so many times\nHelping people that never get the story because he doesn't want the story told but he's always there to help when every cat and\nWhy is that because the media ought to be calling balls and strikes you know they ought to be saying well this is what's going right this is what's going wrong media worse Research Center both do well ... all one of my buddies\nEvery few months as the media coverage is Ninety two percent negative Ninety five percent negative the media is protected by the U.S constitution only business in America that gets constitutional protection the media should call balls and strikes a lot of good stuff a lot of bad stuff why does the media only report the bad enough to go\nThey only report the battle in ministry for the Obama administration you would think that our economy is growing at four percent and we had more Americans working any other time in our nation's history it conflated those to see the Trump agenda is not what the mainstream media wants to talk about I here's a great example just last week I think it was\nA President Trump to an interview with what looked over sixty minutes\nShe interrupted him these five times during that interview to put that in comparison when sixty minutes during an interview with a bomb or a couple of years ago they interrupted him\nMore times have their own agenda their agenda to make the president look bad not to give him credit that he deserves for the success of the ... because they're no longer in the business of reporting the news now in the business of making the news and that the big change over the last two decades\nLewandowski the president or the other night Montana branded as mobs versus\nJobs the only difference is the image of Jay and I think that's brilliant on his part because well look at Brett Kavanaugh along about a truck\nThat ever Trump sticker on getting burned I look at Congress me getting shot I look at the Republican congressman Republican operatives getting beat up and getting stuck in the side with and\nI look at how you're confronted and airports in restaurants mobs versus jobs\nAnd do you think the average American I think forty percent of what the president forty percent oppose him there's twenty percent going back and forth do you think that the moniker of the president mobs versus jobs is going to stick\nI think it will stick because look the American people see and hear what people like Eric Holder had to say very recently when they're down we kick them and we kick them in the head you know the the cost of violence by the leaders of the Democratic party whether it's\nA Maxine Waters or other is saying if you see them in a gas station if you see them in a restaurant you go after them you don't give them a break you know that's not the way our country is supposed to be and I didn't support proper Obama but never ever ever did I ever remember Republicans or conservatives for that matter going after\nMembers of the previous administration when they're eating dinner at a restaurant we've now seen it with\nSarah Huckabee Sanders we've seen with secretary Nielsen ... we've seen with Senator Ted Cruz we've seen what happened to Congressman Steve ... where he almost lost his life\nBecause the mob violence antifa is so out of control here and there you go on their desire is destruction it's not to make our country better this president has created\nI think over for a million new jobs in the last Twenty one months and that's where we should be doing look even if you don't want this president if he didn't want him to succeed you want him to succeed because you want our country and succeed and that's what the differences\nThat Democrats I hate to say this and they hate this president more than they love their country\nOr the other issue the cultural late in his acceptable didn't mean to fame and to make fun of and dismay or the president and the first lady you may recall about a week ago TI who's a rapper then I Will watch nonetheless I saw him and TMZ\nAnd I did a video in which a look alike millennia Trump was stripping nude in the oval office performing sex acts in the oval office and it was culturally acceptable to do that I'm sure he might sell a lot of\nLot of his songs and records and that can you imagine three years ago if a country artist\nHad to pick the Michelle Obama stripping naked in the oval office in performing sex acts in the oval office what would the outcry from the media have been if it was Michelle Obama\nIt wouldn't be front page news for a week on and that rap the or the country artist would have had his life\nProbably threatened on multiple occasions but look let's go back to just again about a week ago Hillary Clinton gave an interview about her husband and his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and they asked her do you think that relationship was inappropriate and less than two weeks ago her answer was\nNo it was appropriate because she was an adult\nHe was president of the United states leader of the free world Monica Lewinsky was an intern and Hillary Clinton is still justifying her husband's behavior can you imagine for one second that was the ... the Congress if Donald Trump had done that with during the media would be saying\nShe did a great job great job by Corey Lewandowski will do it again give me your production in about two weeks house in the Senate give me your production\nUh I think in the Senate Republicans gained four or five seats that increasing the majority and in the house I'm going to say that it's a bold prediction the Republicans are going to hang on by two or three seats to retain the majority and keep the Trump Pence agenda moving forward\nGod Bless America Corey Lewandowski Trump campaign manager thanks for coming on the bill

bet you we find out that you know there's a history of her that nobody wants to know and that's why she linked the way you know when once it with gun oh no I'm not going to put the charges and nobody

all people they just want to watch somebody be destroyed over it\nAllergy known is left isn't and I think it's pathetic and the far reaching ramifications impact the guys like Bill Cosby who sits in the prison at the age of Eighteen years old an American icon\nFits in prison in his eighties over allegations that date back four or five decades meanwhile a guy who vowed then\nI mean you know denial sex abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI thought it was amazing ... you had a situation where he actually raped a woman who told us that Juanita Broderick\nWhen Clinton raped her what what the bloody lamp told her roommate what happened the roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House is president sexually groping in molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd and that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did go to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard in in the bigger double than it has to do more with men\n... me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me to get a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood lefty\nOkay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on your news and these old school actresses and all these ... political feminist\nTaking pictures at Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling\nHim to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting there but I found out\nAnd then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting to me to a ends up being built ended up being part of a\nWell being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born a the lecturers activities of left us in Hollywood that and and and the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster child I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters\nOn summer in terms positions with somebody\nAh Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein to to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was a star\nHarvey Weinstein and access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they sent their own daughters end of the character has been in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nKnow they didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are on touchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people\nThere and a daughter that you know that you got to be concerned about cause harm people take advantage of them but the the what the what rocket bombing selling us I have so much power I Know that this guy the lecture is left is who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with him but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't because I'm covered but you're not\nAnd and look at it the less than it is a precautionary tale\nFor many many boys I said many times what harmless thing is your kid your son going to do at the age of Fifteen that some woman's gonna come back twenty five thirty years\nLater and say oh look at what you did to me more if he's not even going to remember it he didn't like it's going to be insignificant to him and her but\nBecause something may be important in life she decide I'll take him down for what\nWell you know it was hanging by a thread two weeks ago and now he's on the court and I think the other issue I Want to get your perspective on this Kevin Jackson and the black sphere\nWhich is the what's happening now with the Honduran migrants coming through or Guatemala into Mexico there right now is three to five thousand strong and they're heading toward the Texas border this is a terrible event for the Democrats over the next two weeks before the election they have the video and the pictures of thousands of migrants\nWhenever I watch MSNBC all I hear about is women and children then I see the video of these migrants coming to urban areas in America and they're almost always young males and the young women tend to be raped or sexually molested the men are drug meals and I'm sure there's good family members among them\nAnd Kevin Jackson of you and your wife and your children were in a\nOr in Honduras in a bill Cunningham and my wife and kids were in\nAnd we're in Honduras living the horrors of socialistic left wing military hunter regime\nThe first thing I Would want to do would be to get to America I understand it completely but along the process it gives billions of dollars MS Thirteen other gang bangers to provide a passage Everytime you go through some other drug infested area Mexico you got to pay\nHomage you gotta pay either sex or money so you didn't pass through and and live by the time you get to the northern part of Mexico according to sixty minutes about two months ago there was hundreds of dead bodies because some men did not want to participate and becoming drug meals to get drugs into America\nSome women were killed because they did not want to be ritual is typically raped on a regular basis this is a horrible journey I watch MSNBC this is about refugee status of desperate people I watch other news outlets and this is terrible Trump's going to send supposedly\nOur soldiers to the southern border to stop it and all of this is playing out during an election that the Democrats supposedly have in the bag because hundreds of millions of dollars up to a billion and it's been pumped into these campaign\nOr buy a Tom Styron by Bloomberg and others in order to uh to me are Republicans all over the counter getting you know you give me over the next two weeks you mean how's this going to play out I like to early on November the sect\nBut Democrats have missed every find they no longer have their finger on the pulse of the American electorate people want our border protected so they and they also get that this is fake news it's contrived it started as a hundred and sixty people now it's up to four thousand how and so\nWhat prompted the right thing he said Honduras these people show up you're losing your aid Mexico I guarantee he made the same call to the new president of Mexico and say look\nIf these people get through you were going to renegotiate our trade agreements we are going to look at the age where he would send you\nTo Mexico the polling military on the southern border so I just heard this literally today good so Mexico's going at it Honduras I bet you will send buses the say you get it you're going to get back to our country or else\nAnd and ... what the lay out they're going to play out to Democrats again overplay their hand they think that there's some issue that's going to be the ... the you know the ... the division point with Americans in Americans overwhelmingly won our borders protect that we don't want these migrating horns to think that they can just come anytime they want\nSo whether whether it's the kind of effect or whether it's the Kavanaugh fact whether it's the fourth of an investigation of the Russian they'll which we now see that that is completely been busted part because a judge Royce Lamberth\nWho just said I don't understand how Cheryl Mills isn't in prison and\nClinton a bunch of others and then there's a conspiracy what the FBI so that's about to break that's going to be the big story this week and then you've got this yet again read a guarded Haitian of the whole border issue the Trump going to send troops and say you're not going in\nNo in fact better on doors you know Kevin Jackson it's bad for a hundred doors in Guatemala and Mexico\nThere's ten uh males generally males to America because it takes away the ability of Hondurans to reform their own government because the safety valve is there to send people to other countries and so what's left are those who cannot function and do a ...\nStart off back in Nineteen twenty three for the New York Yankees when they're first world series the\nBeating the New York Giants' games to to to date

this baking soda volcanoes too big on\nYou don't have to be perfect perfect officers of siblings and foster care will take you just as you are more information on how you can adopt these are the dumps us gun or a public service announcement U.S Department of health and Human Services are dumped us to have counsel [noise]\n[noise]\n\nI thought like hunting and the great American let's continuing were never suffer as they\nWere simply continue the other night on Fox I'm watching and ah the ah speaker made a comment the expert on the administrative agency slashing the Congress that made the comment that every year matter who's the president or something like three thousand new rules are put into effect by\nThe alphabet soup federal government agencies and uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different or what the founding fathers intended what the constitution did not attend\nThe consequences that but not necessarily rules and regulations that caused the American economy billions of dollars every year\nThe constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words\nThat the the the the agencies or the federal government or the state government agencies were mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect and that as a consequence we Americans\nAre going to question the legitimacy of their own government when it's completely on accountable or good men Peter Jay Wallace since written a book judicial fortitude or subtitled the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the kind of a game show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks to go to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got the fifth conservative vote on the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing and in his writings and the second circuit us court of appeals where he was for twelve years\nBrett Kavanaugh often knock down the administrators state ruled by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state how does an impact our lives\nAdminister the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department [noise]\nAll the way down to the FCC and their hunger grab them and the way that may impact our lives is that they make a lot of rules and regulations aren't statute in many cases generations oh and those rules and regulations\nAre not only political that it's there are many of them but they have a major factor in our lives and the ... percent the book that I had written is to explain that we have to\nRein in in in some way\nOr who's ... when the ... when you when you say we have to rain the men who is weak\n[noise] uh well the American people have to bring them in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way it is through the court system and that's why your point about a ... a Brett Kavanaugh having been confirmed for the record is very important because I think he is the host\nOf the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in when he admitted to state by cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nYou give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think the FCC I think the IRS but\nYou're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new every day meeting offices mainly in Washington or all all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day so they started not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation\nGiving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules a day now must be complied with how much harm is not causing as\nWell I think it's causing a lot of harm in the sense of for a business is of course it it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with\nCompliance activities are very extensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each near it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that ... trillion dollars actually gets passed on to all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that these businesses produce so\nThat an important factor in fact a trillion dollars this more than the government actually tax rates are either from businesses are from individuals each year\nSo this is a very significant thing but it can be turned back town they can be reduced give me hold on\nThe [laughter] the idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in\nAnd began to review carefully the legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently\nUm the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are in ... by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if you all these new rules and\nThe court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you've gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority to make this rule and\nThere are a number of examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called dish will forward it to they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations\nOf um of administrative agencies than we can actually began to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington\nPeter Wallison let's go back in time did not hot summer in Philadelphia and Seventeen Ninety seven", "show_name": "Bill Cunningham", "year":
