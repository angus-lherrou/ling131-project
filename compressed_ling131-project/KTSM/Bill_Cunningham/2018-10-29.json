who understands saved his life from the emergency room in Pittsburgh Allegheny General Hospital and not a doctor is Jewish\nAnd the two nurses who first arrived at the scene to save the rotten filthy life for Robert Bowers are Jewish\nHow serendipitous the Jews save the life of Robert Bowers\nAnd if I was in charge I Would a deal with all the other ones first to deal with him last to know fully what a blood out but unfortunately he's alive now being cared for in a Pittsburgh hospital by Jewish doctor\nMy God and so I look about what happened in the hate this guy exhibited for many many months that I like to know where are the people he communicated with\nWas he a friend that was ... who else knew what he was saying the things he was saying\nAnd and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great friend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history that Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka\nHas become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner is a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the president has it\nAnd that many Jewish religious functions says I have and so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews when Trump is the best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a tweet presidential press secretary quote is there any tragedy the Washington Post will not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel\nSo oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump\nTo put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans so that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing website is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not\nIn fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ...\nThe New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact\nCNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park\nThat stimulated the stabbing the murder of the president last June performing Shakespeare's Julius Caesar they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and their performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated this stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama\nI Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor see Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson\nAttempt to the masses assassination of Republican members of Congress resulting in the motor wounds to Stephen ... piece\nThe Washington Post the next day ran a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio\nEven though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate\nOf a Bernie Sanders and also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow\nSo instead of focusing on the facts you know Hodgkinson actually traveling hundreds of miles to the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and it was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter or frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence stirred up by right wing talk radio\nOver the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples\nOf left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans people like sex or a defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and in fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it\nBecause all the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it if there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out to restaurants\nAnd also when a Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant a Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street other diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell who's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet\nAnd the media doesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor brick Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote andme word\nOne other example whenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist cover the words they express as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist from in ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right committing acts of violence that is covered completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion\nIs Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people apply\nIn fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam begun the anti Semite set a large rally that Jews are termites and thousands in attendance applauded and cheered coding juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan\nWhere President Bill Clinton and broccoli saying Obama stood next to head pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight not to allow the public to know that he was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago\nAnd that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgust me\nI Hope soon very soon but a Bowers is killed either a by lethal injection heading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it Timothy McVeigh for violence and\nBowers was a Trump hater but the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting when I get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray affair to talk about what's happening on the ...\nThe border is anyone thought about the public health crisis\nCaused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding in the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough aids ... diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\nPlane\nWhere like neither ... horsepower and that and protect something you see something\nI say for my friend\nI sang from my youth\nWe see say\nThat unifies community were on hard\nOf the time for you or TV or\nSunday Disney ... most famous character in the special Mickey's not just the secular with appearances and performances by Christian Bale Tony hail they're highly Josh Groban begging trainers background band and more party with the house or the mouse Sunday at age seven central on ABC\nAlso on Sunday the ... time travel drama out later kicks off its fourth season at age seven central stars\nThat's your T.

years of the Trump Administration will\nBe the peaceful two years ago they said the last two years are going to be a disaster let's continue now with ah Joel in Virginia Joel in Virginia Welcome to the bill Cunningham show Joel how are you\nI can even bill cranky for taking my call when it's that I have four you'll have some friends they called me earlier today\nFrom Florida and they're talking about and that's to kill them who's running as the Democratic candidate\nFor governor you know that what they're telling me is that tape and write a lot of commercials and the state of Florida and which do have and also they have been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier as well as a lot of um um Maxine Waters and others\nHave been in the state of Florida campaigning and they have been coming up in reference to a federal indictment and bobbing this to kill him and every time that comes up he keeps coming up with the race card\nI'm Wondering what you thought find reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum as a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidate in Arizona\nAndrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida that police departments are like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor\nFlorida whatever have now they're saying this is not the most uh\nIs that the most exciting character I Know but at least he's not Andrew Gillum ... at least she wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders Maxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government\nAnd cash straight the police departments you of numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him have Andrew Gillum wins in Florida I Would be shocked\nBy the people that are called me at a ticket ... for the people that are written up and move out of the state because from what I tell them they caught in a state income tax\nIncome tax income tax at all or wherever it may be will probably be doubled according to what their fame and apparently that's also come out and his literature so it looks like he does have this kind of a massive accident when a state of Florida\nYou know Joel I'm a great supporter of police in whenever accomplish killed I always mention their names there are many cop killers are who have not been identified yet and cops are dead when you have\n... the chief executive officer of the great state of Florida\nWho is made numerous remarks about cops being similar to slave catchers that cops are occupying forces you can't have someone like that in charge of police departments he's the chief executive officer of the great it's great state of Florida and honestly you can have it so let's take a short break\nWhen we continue or we'll go to Nick and then a

[noise]\nHa Kelly calling us continue the tragedies the tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about these situations whether it's an attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy that ah NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a\nVery sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff joining me now is that a saint Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas Redskin welcome again to the bill Cunningham shown Thomas are you\nGoing to be very tough situation an awful um but when I watch\nSome of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hit menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet to kind of shy\nAnd said oh goodbye no difficulties and he had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was two uh two nights on Israel didn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren are Jewish\nAnd ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless uh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's response\nOf all the Washington Post a yesterday afternoon it today did ugly reporting\nYou saying that uh that in fact a Sarah Sanders put out something a\nFew hours ago just said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post went out exploit do attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nLet's go back from a police perspective some have said uh the analysis the experts come out of the woodwork now saying the Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should've known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial anti Semitic anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or ... is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement\nIn this case I not as of yet when I've seen\nIs you know hindsight is always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was monitoring his ... his social media and his other things that he was posting and couldn't have alerted police [laughter]\nWhat what we always say is if you see something say something\n[laughter] this case you know someone had the scene\nAnd could've alerted the police on the police when you find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about ... hours and and do something or didn't look to see if this guy does have guns or potentially follow him\nThen we can criticize the police but until that time\nPolice and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting and Broward County there was a woman or call FBI numerous people and call it about an Eighteen year old up punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people called in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on horse but you're only as good as she is today and wish I could take on force is very easy to do after the same but law enforcement is tough on so I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we always did a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case in the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what could we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm sure in Pittsburgh and the FBI and other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers had posted just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media\nSomebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating and I and that person did not do anything now the experts have said because I'm sure there's several thousand individual sadly in the country like ours wedding for a trigger moment\nThat social media exacerbates highlight these kinds of feelings because those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago\nYou sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people ... other like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against uh against Jews\nAnd against African Americans every several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously wrote I never voted for Trump nor a vibrant own Warner even touch the mega had\nHe goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish\nBut the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it so when you went in NYPD or you go back right now the Pittsburgh Police or go back in time and say\nWhat did he do when did he do it who did you send these messages to and investigate them as to why something wasn't done and about the guns right now according to media counts three fifty seven magnitude since and blocks that were legally purchased than they are Fifteen just don't track and nothing down and see what it is\nSo you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what it said it's a matter of how we're saying and it's a matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments to there and agree right they have to be ready\nTo respond to a ... guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going

thousands of people but they're on knots like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy

a Republican or club which had a lot of push people him at the other day and I had to them you know you guys always used to tell me that Bush was the best for Israel and Donald Trump is proven that Bush didn't even do enough but when you were saying about Jerry now I Know him very well\nJerry is someone who has been passed up time and time again by the ... a Democrat Party you want it to be

not like that house member even if that particular house member did not support that Donald Trump's agenda\nTrust me that is a vote for Donald Trump and it is one of the most consequential elections you know the liberal they really know how to use the levers of government the levers of media and the levers of in general you know unfair play much better than not\nThe only one we've ever had as a fighter like Donald Trump this really is Donald Trump's first real like that a lot of ways and this is has started once you get from the day that he was elected they have been out to get him how do I know this\nBecause remember in two thousand nine two thousand and two I'm Brock Obama had a knee jerk reaction to anything that went badly he would just blame it on George W.

American people something you of a put forth in one of your missteps\nAnd that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and\nThen the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico what the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest caravan is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal in Oregon I stopped by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment order chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together at one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator than the activist who got this together explained that that the major media will do it\nWell you know Bill thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population is way to destabilize and disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here\nWhere we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states who has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people\nSome of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a\nGang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a\nEast Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is uh if you just watch on TV where they try to show that you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing ... suddenly appearing medical care is certainly appealing this this is not something that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where\nYou end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the free hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone at the Democratic party explain why ... here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all of these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nA care of and that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a\nPictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift\nAnd not only destabilized South Florida but it ended up leading probably two or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of
