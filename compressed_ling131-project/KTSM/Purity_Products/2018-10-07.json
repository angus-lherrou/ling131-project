{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "It is middle do or\nWhat I thought it was so I don't have time for cold weather that\nOh yeah yep and use it you spray it on the next couple of weeks you'll be absolutely fine\nOh okay and what kind of feel or should I say\nWell the sealer you want to make sure you get a good breed the sealer so again we're always recommended one called a brand name as masonry defender and it's a driveway and sidewalks sealer\nOkay thank you very\nVery good thank you take care and that's a good project it really is this time of year perfect will get it down and it's going to take you know five six weeks it'll start to light ... and then all of a sudden\nIt's effect a funny story I did this on my driveway and I did it in the springtime\nAnd um it was all kind of a black ... and I was sprayed the wedding forget on it and it is funny outta sight outta mind it's not like I was obsessed with it where I kept going out every three days and looking at it\nBut I didn't at all actually\nUh about two or three months went by and I just pulling in the driveway one down and what\nThat's all gone [laughter] I mean and that is the way it works it just is all gone it takes the sunlight the rain and everything else to get rid of it but it'll work quite nicely Kay welcome\nHigh on to crash and I every time we get a really heavy rain I have water thinking into my tenure block wall in one corner basement crawl space and then I get these really late like all over the election that down the drain\nOn is there anything I can do to stop it from coming in\nSo I didn't hear the part that comes over and falls into the drought\nBut yeah it's across the bay at five four feet up and it's got a finance floor in there it's very clean\nAnd but I can kind of looking at the block with a flashlight I can see their stance on it flying now that's where it's coming in and then you get all the time the concrete floor of the crawl space and then it gets over the edge of the crowd stay on the regular flowing down the drain\nSo you will just keep water from getting into the crawl space reserved some bumps in the crawl space\nAnd now I don't need when it's just like little teeny record it but\nThere are I don't know what a ... where if you pour a lack of water on something and it'll have like a couple of little river coming down rather than in ...\nOkay um well to stop water from coming you got to give it a pass a path of least resistance so huh right now the path of least resistance is going through the wall and you have access to water now is it coming through the walls are coming up or the floor in the wall beat\nA wall block yeah okay so is there a got her on that side on the outside yeah everywhere and they're not clogged no and the down spouse where do they empty\nUh there's one in that corner and it goes underground\nAnd ... are you sure that's free flowing all the way in removing all that water away from the house\nI think I mean from what they make it I can think\nOkay well that's what I Want you to check 'em because you know it it didn't leak before something's changed and are actually\nIt was like bought the house eight years ago and okay\nSo houses so there's there's three things that are causing the water in there that Jesus\nGutters the groundwater the grading on the outside of the house so we got to make sure they're all functioning let's start with the gutters make sure they're you know free flowing in all cleared out and unless you're going out there during a rainstorm with an umbrella and watching where the water from that down spouse exit out that by\nI can assure you don't know if it's free flowing or not so next time it rains that's what you need to do the second thing is you want to make sure that the soil is slope away from the house gay\nOr you know we have the overhang house in the overhang several feet under there and do we try I have to water\n... last rain doesn't lie under their yeah uh-huh and and is there any tips or ... or anything of the uh [noise] how 'bout the pipes going around the house um water\nYeah we have a good if we go there ... former right depth going down that corner but it's a white PVC pipe and there are no\nIt looked to be an act\nBut is it underground no background what good is that doing above\nGr I don't know [laughter] personally time on his hand and he was really\nRather not really doing any good above the ground so you know there is what they call it underground French drain a that would go around the perimeter\nWhich it moves the water away\nI'm so and do some up I mean if you're looking for a quick cure or I don't know if there is one if you can get somebody net crawl space and put a waterproof pain on that wall like a product like dry locked that'll certainly um was is seal that wall\nAnd make it more difficult for the water to get in\nA to Z crawl space itself so you'll see all that wall up\nThe question mark then becomes where does that water go and does it cause any more damage\nSo I Would um you know if you're looking for a quick easy solution or go ahead and put some dry luck on that wall but keep your eyes open to make sure that uh isn't coming somewhere else into that house but the three keys to getting water out of the basement I'm telling you is gutters\nGroundwater in grading they're called the killer jeez so you're kind of telling me all those are just fine and you still have that problem so maybe sealed up with some dry lock and hopefully that'll take care of the problem if it's a simple easy to solve problems maybe it will All right\nThanks much for the call okay I appreciate it\nUh one of my all time favorite products courses jaws you hear me talking about

[laughter]\nYeah yeah I hear ya it does um so it is for us and so I'm sure there is salts in may scenario products of bricks the border between the bricks and when that becomes compromised and um gets\nAnd a lot that's how it becomes compromise those salts begin to bloom and they started out as white shadows and they can actually get to a point where literally looks like table salt on the surface of the brick\nAnd um you know I'm sure what the folks whose sole Jew a is an F ... remover I I Can't tell you why would not work I can tell you however when you use an F fluorescence remover\nUm it will remove the F ... but that doesn't mean it's not going to come back\nThe other ... there's some deterioration\nTaken place in there's moisture outside and it will continue to be a challenge to keep that off but\nOnce you use a cleaner it should be clean for a while so that part I don't understand um you know one of the products I've mentioned for this as quick creek makes a product called ... in rushed remover\nA knee and it requires an application and require some scrubbing rinsing et cetera and then I Would get a brick sealer on there to minimize the amount of water penetration that can get into the breaking get into the border\nSo it will slow the process of that ... blooming\nSo you know that's that's my story ... but I don't know why the other stuff lemon juice isn't strong enough\nOf it but uh if he got ... she went to a brick company I'm sure they sold to an F fluorescence remover in I I don't know they did why that didn't work unless it mine are heated applications did you\nCheck back with them and expressed why that didn't work or yeah followed all the directions and everything\nGoing to go back to them that lever road listening to even try

off or worse\nBut okay we can get along um we've power washed but then we're told we our white\nRight power wash it actually exacerbate the problem because you're putting water that you're kind of force and into that brick\nOkay so\nSo you know again you can check out that quick create a fluorescence remover ... you know instructions follow him to the letter of the law and then get a good missionary brick sealer on that house and that'll slow down the process\nOkay what what's your name again quote quick Crete have fluorescent scene and rust remover came over and get that\nI'm Home

quite honestly It's MORNING my job is six thirty this morning was do eat breakfast and have coffee and I'm sitting here and I'm going like\nWe have the wastebasket that's underneath the sink\nAnd there was just a very mild voter took to you know the the garbage bag out and it was still just a very mild ...

All right um\nAnd they don't give me a really hard time about just require an incredible amount of documentation but what I'm calling you about it have you heard a lot of people\nVoicing concern that are ... ... it's the cellulose in the woods Terry Rachel that would actually watch not on the surface what from the inside out I mean you could aboard finally kicks in it does is you can put your foot through\nYeah um I just wanted to make sure this is it this is not a composite ...\nNo it's okay it's what\nYeah I've had a a few calls but I Can't say that I've had a lot of calls a bit more about the composite then then I have the pressure treated wood but the whole industry as a whole and I'm sure you realize this and found that out in your researching it wasn't just one company as the entire\nIndustry when they went from C. C. H. treated wood to the AC cute too then other formulations there were issues there were issues with the AC you I'm with the um rusting of the actual Joyce hangers\nAn actual nails and screws exact and then they went into these other ones and the the different types I mean everybody's using different formulations and they work but but I Can't say that it is a massive problem at least that is touch me [noise]\nWell I can see from my standpoint it's actually I Can't call massive problem it's a ... so aggravating because as I replaced boards\nIt's so hard to you know feeling individual board and my deck is probably dying ten twenty percent at a time\nYeah well it's a math problem if it's happening to you [laughter] well yeah\nBut I my decision has to be whether I keep replacing the Borgias they go bad or terrible thing up and spend a huge amount of money to put something else though so anyway I just was concerned if you've heard that\nI had a few calls and I have heard of it and when I said massive I mean I'm not getting calls every\nWeek about it um but what it is out there um\nYeah I get it then I get the whole you know do I do I bite the bullet now or do I just keep letting it made me and just do it a little bit of time I totally understand that\nThe other thing I Would I'd like to share with your listeners is that one of the documentation things on these boards it's not the stamp the stamp on the board\nThat only tells them where the lumber may Russia's right but the sticker on the in the little stapled on usually a plastic sticker\nBut yeah if they're going to put down back porch pork or those offers stick them in an envelope receive them because that's the that's the crucial part is proving your ... processed\nAnd ... powers process that\nExactly what was your who saved those labels huh yeah well actually\nI actually was fortunate one feeling up some of my bad boards I found a couple of those into joining early shake my ...\nI hear ya I don't think I Would have saved them actually write in you know even to this day Jim I'll just taken a step further because we just try to educate people the best we can um we went through a process just a three or four years ago\nWhere in processing they started this thing called ground contact and non ground contact pressure treated wood\nAnd I stated on here numerous times you can have a deck that's twelve feet up in the air [noise] and if you got trees around it and wet leaves fall on it it's the same as ground contact\nAnd ... do you how to use the ground contact pressure treated would all the time in my book and now after four years we're starting to see\nSome of the big box stores the lumber yours figured is a long time ago uh but you know it's all about price and the big box stores and they now some of 'em are just carrying just the ground contact thank God\nBecause she says makes perfect sense yeah exactly well\nI don't know if you want to hear a court version of this but if any of your folks have been to Stockholm, Sweden a hiatus they discovered the ship was the ... was discovered in the Nineteen nineties or late eighties\nAnd it was a ship built by the king of suing them or warship he went down to the architects office after they get laid the keel for this thing and he said wait a minute you've only got one of the ship I Want to ... the architect should know\nYour your majesty we can only do one guy on deck because that's the way the ships designed hey I'm the king I Want to ... you know he's the game\nSo they built a ship with two ... actually launched the ship bands played one old and it it drifted out into the harbor and a little breeze came up the ship flipped upside down and went to the bottom\nAnd they discovered it a couple of hundred years later the building museum so that was it's in a museum in Stockholm harbor was a result of this is a sweet tooth got me sleeping lumber people their whole life\nAre probably the foremost in this whole idea would preservation mhm and those are the guys they're the best stuff already on what happens to cellulose would have made some pretty ...

to have you um as a health care leader um we we talked about some of the plans that you have for the city um is the only specific experience um but before we get into that is behind every great man there's a great woman and you talk about that\nYou're absolutely right by the agreement is significantly even better woman and um so I my my wife I'm Alisa is absolutely incredible and she's my rock I uh I I've been married now for just over a year and a half it was a it was an interesting transition\nUm I I found out about uh the opportunity here uh in El Paso um the day before I was planning on proposing to her um that was December nights of two thousand sixteen\nAnd I was playing on a proposed on December tents and I'm In an effort to try to make sure that I'm a guy who was starting to marriage off on the right foot I asked her a sweetheart how would you feel about move in El Paso before I asked her if she wanted to marry me\nThe the opposite probably wouldn't have been the right way to start off of marriage but um uh we we ended up getting married or the the entire thing was uh was quite a whirlwind um uh we\nUm got engaged on December tenth and then two weeks later I'm her parents were in town visiting for Christmas and her father ended up being diagnosed with met a static pancreatic cancer I'm at the hospital actually where I was working at the time I'm\nA he's still alive which is a remarkable um but uh but when we were asking him dad you know what's on your bucket list what you want to do he said I Want to walk my daughter down the aisle and so in three weeks we're planning on doing a a wedding at some point but literally I at that point in three weeks we ended up planning our entire wedding soup to nuts\nOr my last day of work in Austin was on friday February tense um ended up driving to Houston got married there at my parents' church on Sunday February twelfth jumped on a plane should I jumped out and play it on the thirteenth flew out here and I started to work on Valentine's Day wow was it was a little bit of a World War\nI I get a get a little tired of hearing about that a little bit when did with that and I mean by a ride man\nTo have a woman who ah who is supportive of all that again she's my absolute rock\nSo well now we also send a welcome to her so Paso\nThis is the case yes I'm\nA ... am station is El Paso cures radio show where he joined today with Mr David Shemp the c._e._o. del sol hospital and medical center I'm David give me give me give me your impression of the American health care system\nAs far as its reach to the people that basic level of care\nYou know I I think that the American health care system is one of the most convoluted industries\nIn not just in America but really within the world I'm from uh from arguments and end discussions around as ... as health care really are right or privilege\nUm uh the complexity of\nUh of billing the complexity of healthcare delivery\nUh the way in which healthcare different a different insurers end up subsidizing others so I'm a those are those who have um employer based health care insurance oftentimes end up just supporting him subsidizing\nI'm a those who who are uninsured or under insured um uh the way that Medicare is delivered on a federal level whereas medicate is delivered on a on a statewide level um it is the most complicated industry I'm really I think within within not just us but but the world\nUm and so at the heart of that is is how do we take care of people\nUm and ah and and thankfully ... love and a lot of people come together to be able to make it work that way right\nRight even I'm David what pricing for hospitals supplies or that system so complicated by itself the average person doesn't understand that\nNo absolutely not and and I mean I think there's there's all this\nA myth around the thirty five dollar Tylenol pill type things uh as as to how hospitals end up developing their charges\nUm the reality is is that uh you based on our charge mastering the negotiated a a agreements that we have with insurance companies based on how Medicare Medicaid end up paying 'em there's nobody in the hospital that pays what ultimately ends up being charged if we're looking at straight one hundred percent that ...\nAnd so it's it's a convoluted I'm a a method of negotiation between ah insurance companies and payers I'm ... from the federal government um and and from the states through ah through the various insurance programs right\nRight okay so you're just joining us we're joined by Mr David Sheff the chief executive officer of del sol medical center in hospital\nI'm David um can you\nTell us he tells a little bit of an HD gay and what's your experience has been what they say before which is so much what's ... what's your ... means and what it's meant to you\nAc a is the parent company of lost almost also healthcare um it's uh the the world's largest I'm a health care company a we have over a hundred and eighty hospitals here in the U. S. uh and several over in Great Britain\nUm uh it is it was a company that was founded by physicians um and uh it is an investor owned a company I mean it's actually who I've spent my entire career with all those different places that I mentioned from uh Denver Oklahoma Austin El Paso have all been where they see a um the nature of of being an investor owned a organization I think\nDefinitely drives I'm a drives a higher level of quality higher level of efficiency because investors demands that or the wall street\nThe demands that and so it's a company that have been incredibly proud to work for our mission ... mission is above all else were we are committed to the care and improvement of human life\nUm and that's a mission that we live out in each of our facilities on each and every day with every single patient we come in contact with\nUm it's it's a phenomenal organization to work for um uh we we the way in which we invest to the way in which we a drive our clinical excellence of the way in which we invest our facilities uh the way in which we um uh\nHave a have expectations run our own performance and how patients are experiencing their care and and patient satisfaction it's those are all pillars what our company ends up being and so I'm I'm proud of them had been again been with a shape for over Fifteen Years now and I'm incredibly proud to be a part of this\nUm and El Paso in should be proud of\nThe reputation and quality of care that they see a a not only are not only expects but insists on\nUm for the way that we're able to deliver care here in here in the community\nWonderful well this is Kate DSM radio ... am on your dial my name is Dr Marcella I'm joined\nBy David Shemp is chief executive officer of del sol hospital medical center [noise] um we talked about\nDavid we talked about your journey at this point so far um I Want to drill down a little bit of back into some of the specific things that you guys are doing over there now all we had a missed the ... the ... last moments on as a guest in recent weeks\nIn one of the things that struck me and they said was that his chief\nAsset in hospital our employees David talk about some of that she said she facets that you have\nAnd um how you put that to work every day to make that operation\nYou're absolutely right and and Don is absolutely right I mean our our strategic advantage our um our number one asset is our employees um we have over fourteen hundred employees that del sol\nUm and we could not deliver the care that we do without ... without their participation without their expertise um\nAs as we look at other industries there's a lot of other industries that end up having things that would be outsourced to other countries health care is such a a personnel dependent industry um that you're not going to be able to outsource nursing you're not going to be able to outsource doctors you're not gonna be able to outsource ... staff all those are are very personnel dependent\nUm and truly our our strategic advantage into ends up being our people\nI'm from uh from phenomenal caregivers who are so incredibly trained 'em in in OB in Perry operative and emergency services and critical care uh in in general bedside nursing I'm a in cancer care we have some ... truly phenomenal people and and they are our strategic advantage", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "El Paso", "day": "07"}
