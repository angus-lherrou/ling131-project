{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "There is a product that will definitely eliminate that smell um\nThe the question I have is not knowing exactly where it is we're both assuming that the deck\nHas been used as the bathroom for the dogs and yeah but it has come and it is on the wood it's not around the deck it's not underneath the deck it's not cats from the neighborhoods it's it's on the deck correct\n... on the deck I mean during the day that Grapel based on your age uh and so obviously with the spacing and I'm Wondering if some if they got in there because I have partial washed it multiple times you know throughout the summer\nMhm right and the ... the wood deck is open correct is not an enclosed patio room or something like\nThat yes it is open okay\nUm there's a website which I'm going to give you and it's called odor exit actually we had the motives are project of the week last week it's O D O R\nX. I. T. Dakota odor exit dot com they make a multitude of different\nUh products that um will take care and the limb and ate a smells in fact they have one that eliminates mold in viruses but uh the product you want for this is called the odor exit concentrate\nIt's four ounces two gallon the secretive using this as you want to saturate that\nAnd one of the challenges that we have in you said I think that you could see all this stack\nYeah a stain it or mhm uh beginning of the year I let it sit for a good year from last year good and then the beginning next year I you know like ... you know all the way through the weather good weather [noise] and then uh\nSo I think it was around ... ... and April early may that's what I stand it\nSo that's one of the challenge if that's stained his field that would I'm kinda\nWondering how the urine is penetrated into the woods\nYet to create to smell and to hold that smell for two months so we certainly want to saturate the would because you know use the word saturated cause that is the way you should apply it but I'd really concentrate on where the boards about each other okay because that probably is unsealed\nA maybe a cut down between the boards that are unsealed urine was whipped into the woods and hence we have this lingering odor of but I feel real confident that that product will eliminate your problem wing\nOkay All right Chris Shays Yes sir okay it's older ... dot com okay thank you are\nQuite welcome thank you you do the same again our phone numbers or eight hundred eight two three eight to five five and we're talking home

the deck will quickly run out of time in many parts of the country\nTo ah get those deck sealed again you want to use and acrylic sealer\nIt's going to hold up much better in the sun or make sure you clean it makes your use up writing or make sure we open up those wood fibers so we can get that debt ceiling compound into the woods last longer so run out of time to do that also you know staying on the ceiling theme\nWe've got the feeling of decks we also they have concrete Steelers\nAgain there's a website masonry defender at his\nProject specific Steelers\nSo if you have stamped concrete to get a sealer for that garage floor they get a sealer for that I'm exposed beggar is to look for that favors a sealer for that hey it's six or seven different sailors again a lot of these products can be used down all the forty degree temperature you want to read the label\nOr and then there's going to kind of cut off so I Know many of you are gonna butt up against the calendar and that'll quickly eliminate those up their projects but why you have taught and it's been a while especially if you live in different parts of the country where you get snow and ice and\nYou wrote solve that is very very corrosive\nOr to concrete so it's imperative\nThat that concrete gets sealed um to prevent Spalding you've seen that it's a cold like concrete acne\nIt's the surface popping off the concrete so ceiling that minimizes that salt brine solution from penetrating into the concrete and doing damage to serve getting that sealed getting the brick around your house sealed um asphalt driveways

trained is great pool on ...\n... by the Catholic rites of life dot org\nStay informed with news radio six Ninety KTBS am am El Paso\n\nIn the ... as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with the new fixture and you just use the existing wiring is already there you know additional wires yeah it's all everything else has wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minutes a project and you turn off the brick or by the way so\nGood point about you [laughter] very good very good so you turn off the breaker literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm you know that he has a nice little diagrams you know for the screws need to come out and you just sliding in\nWearing a black why or why are why or ground to ground\nScrew your business him absolutely any download the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go\nIt's a very easy process okay so seriously it is that easy I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Soviet the\nOld flood light you can just simply ... yes if you get a flight over your\nPatio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the light and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate which is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the plate up you're not actually holding the light in your head it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd um went that's once that's mounted you take up to light and you just snap it in the place and you're good to go\nSo fairly ... light the maximus flood light is easier to mount then a flood like you buy the big box slowly it really is because of the ... I Am absolutely have really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's at your door\nSo I'm at work you get alert I'm In the office in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us as well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes a sound\nOr ... whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise would however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation\nIf you'd like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if they're a burglar alarm that can be press\nSo if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for for downloading viewing later so\nSo if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter] you can see if there's kids coming out and see a lot ... usually not every child legs are products\n[laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years so this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light a application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer the the poor side does come in different um different styles indifferent finishes 'cause we try to comedy you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there\nYou know as it relates to porch lights we've you know really know competitors the flight there was another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe and our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product\n[noise] what would be the differences that the quality of the camera\nYeah the quality of the cameras detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera it's a hundred and two hundred Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the for more on the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource um heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals as I Am really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time\nI'm it's just it's again there's so many features and our app that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often [noise]\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle when you talk about the distance but its position of ... to\n... yeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the flow of light and the coach later the other a poor choice we put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed the product\nYou want to aim that cameras or you get the optimal um field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a lock and rainy and lock that camera and the place and then and typically it just stays there then\nWhen you're watching a when you're watching the um the\nEither the life feet are you watching the video later you can ... you can actually ... so you're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if you use them in with the pension is great great\nSo I'm Daniel let's open up the

and we've been talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates LED lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds before before what before\nYou see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weeks in the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver of FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video you actually watch the driver walk up to your house and put the box on your porch ring the doorbell elite\nYou'll see everything or throw it or whatever they do [laughter] or throwing or I

phones and if you have a question about this feel free to jump on board again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five in Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I had to quit the ghetto and how could that ... what the camera huh now what happened that many perfectly cut that their damages or cover your head is that possible for them to cover it so they can't do anything\nWell sure I mean if they are they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block so sure of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there's a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other small feature we actually have established light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means is on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on and the person does not see that when they walk up to your door so\nBut very good question to die and you're thinking\nThere's not alarm goes off on your phone it how many were actually not a light off the wall faith so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\n[noise] okay I can think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart in order to really said another day to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI uh I have a question we shoot the trick or treaters\n... yes I mean the um you know the porch light is the on your front door um I mean that's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nSo yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button lives she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button\nA recording that activity or any I\nI just curious because we have virtually my mom turned off the air every ten minutes though they're turning around the house are warning if they are the way to get the sense that they are\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control this zones are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once you install the product you can kinda tune which alert you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've built all that features into the product in the app very cool and then\nSee that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five or Sheila welcome\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have any generators that are run by ... or any solar panels or any how both Kyle or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so ... well I don't\nI mean I don't think of the future [noise] okay well ... actually today marks\nReady to go with your ... question ... I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one picture we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home\nNo matter where you are there'll be a mess he gets into your phone that says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's a user either their wife eyes out okay or the power's out but we don't offer um any type of supplemental power this time we get that question it's something that we're hearing that\nYou can pick out a podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solve online dot com but one of the questions I have for you is we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also and and again did they have any video of this happening at all\nYeah\nBombed them ... and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though right\nWe're gonna we're going to one of the videos is to send them to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we ... we bolted onto the front of the video\nSo you would get the person coming up to the door\nAnd see them in the video before the they damaged let's keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture it's not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually a just a a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what's there yeah it looks like a standard coach like we would know the cameras there unless you're really looking forward\nTo but if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome avoidable\nWere catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nSecond follow up on that and the answer profitability vehicle with mental hospital ego a building that\nI watched the first of all the car chocolate tying health or to security outlook vehicle to\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I have met the first time I've heard that question\nIt's a good one that's great that one day [laughter] yeah sure [laughter] yeah but in the Google it certainly could be pretty up there Lugar sure I'm In\nLove at\nGreat thank you very good thanks angel appreciate it and again these are available at Costco it's available at home depot smart listeners I'm telling you what a ... and\nThey were actually the promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every store ... lows carries I Believe in five or six hundred stores okay I'll take care of the product to say okay can they order online course yet you Googled maximus smart security ... light you'll find all the different the coverage platforms that you can buy the product\nOkay I think I Know the answer to this one Andy welcome\nHey my question was you touched on the lights earlier but our our and the camera I got a ... actually just hit the light switch as I'm walking out the door [noise] am I going to lose the functionality of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that said that the camera can not be turned off I mean you get an education at the ... the cameras off line but um we recommend that you actually eliminate to switch so that the powers never uh never turned\nOff and then just programming it on your apt to do whatever you\nWant yeah and and you can turn the alerts off too so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off you know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure but we recommend the optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off All right All right\nVery good thank you up by the way we got one line open we got just a few more minutes with mark and we want to grab it real quick it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five eight ... two three eight to five
