Jeff welcome\n[noise] hey how are ya I got a question to question for you and I first I have a large one shake shingle roof\nAnd it is starting to get a lot of moss build up at the end of the shape okay and so I'm Wondering what I can do about that it prevented second in\nSome of these trench all rain that we've seen this summer I'm getting you know though water that's going over the\nGutter and it has fallen down on them I damn concrete and I'm getting some of the mosque build up there as well I think maybe from the roof mhm so to live in power washing that but uh it\nSeems like there's gotta be something that I can do to\nCoded that might prevent it from building up the way it is no just yeah yeah\nWell whenever we got a water you know outside we certainly got all those spores that are going to grow exactly what's growing on your roof in on your concrete so what we can do uh I guess the first thing they ask is why is it spilling over the gutters are the gutters undersized do they clogged are they what's going on there\n[noise] uh [noise] you know I I Am going to try something that um [noise] they got a brush thing\nYou said I think it may be a little bit under side but it really only one we're getting those trenches rain\nShow the normal rain it doesn't happen ... do you know what size gutter they are\nA fan of uh I\nI think I mean orange yeah yeah\nWell minimum you'd want on your house is a five foot five is spilling over probably a six a beginner brush does a good job keeping a leaf and debris out it's not going to do much for calling got or if it's still spilling over\nA but just keep that in the back of your mind or obviously as much water as we can keep off that slab the better it's going to\nUm stay non moldy in non middle do so there's a product you hear me talk about all the time the wet and forget product up so that wasn't forgets right they make it in a concentrate that you can put it in a spray tank\nOr the hose and wet and forget you spray down on the seat or roof it'll get rid of the mole mildew or the moss the algae the fungus the like in and everything else\nAre you spray it on and you could do the same on your stamp patio it'll probably take\nA ... this time of year four to eight weeks were to disappear but you spray it on and it just dissipates\nYou might notice it or you might not notice anything for three or four weeks but it'll kill it it'll be a complete kill it we'll minimize just three gross it will prevent it but it will minimize it\nUm you could come back on that roof and spray that every just two or three years as a maintenance spray yeah 'cause usually that stuff's role and a couple of years before you ever see it but it'll help minimize the re growth and go ahead\nLike we get it seems like it in a way they're sharing\nSharing it is ... and it will um so yeah there's there's certainly Steelers for cedar shingles their Steelers for your stamp concrete\nAnd the more you can get those particular ... substrates sealed the less water penetration occurs a but first the first step is to get rid of the ... the middle do\nMake sure it's all gone when you come back in the in the springtime or I Would send you to a a website called masonry\nDefender or they have a stamp concrete steel or I Would get it on their when we're talking about the five which stain that too can be applied to the cedar Shaikh group\nWhich it minimizes water of water penetration in both the substrate and then you you you know there's the boats are just going to be maintenance issues\nOf ads are seal up the concrete that Yes sir uh\nAnd they get like really good you know what I mean you know just make sure all of that ... completely gone\nBefore you start to stealing it but what forget

I mean it's still got a lot of life in it if it's only Nineteen years old but I'm telling you we have some new designs that are worth you know\nBefore we get into the designs Justin let's let's seriously talk about the benefits as we head into the winter months\nI had last year I Can't I Can't remember last week besides last winter but I think less where it was kinda chilly we had some pretty cold but I think we got below zero in our neck of the ...\nMy garage never got below forty degrees I get the little you know they're starting to come in for ... never got below forty degrees amazing\nIn in ... you think about well you know my garage why do I care about the temperature in the garage well first off when you get in your car do you want it to start up right away do you want it to be struggling\nPipes doing your pipes to freeze your beer and the ... you know if you're in the garage sale has said on the bottom of all those sorts of things can happen and those are important things not they have a right so now but in all seriousness the a and a pipes freezing as a real concern and there's a lot of pine earning grudges\nAnd if you're having insulated garage door you're going to have far less likely probability of those those guys ... years ago when I was dating\nMy ... my my my my job was to insulate just pipes and that garages old wooden door and pipes run across the ceiling man those things would freeze every year we don't really get those thinker than my job was to fall so now that out\nWhen you're talking now is probably not even a problem if he had a really good insulated ... is it different qualities of ... there are\nA yeah you can get a a poly ... that's the same type of insulation and having those uh phone cuts guy might use guy and then there's polyurethane orange ... that's the big one yes our intel core garage doors used that polyurethane a phone and what that does is that gets in all the nooks and crannies and it's\nIt's a higher our values so it's a it's going to keep the cold out the warm in better than anything so yeah that's our until the court product line and it's going to be the top of the line when it comes to insulation\nSo we always talk about the beauty of doors would ears are but the real bones how effective it is and how warm it keeps your garage which ineffectual then keep your house that worm that really plays that's that's a that's a key if somebody is an old steel ... or ... would door\nRight yeah it's not I mean having the ... the base of a quality insulated product is important and then the aesthetics for sure something that we uh we definitely focus I had\nA one of your a big dealers or bill every door on last Saturday and we're talking about yeah we're talking about getting that door ready for winter doors breaking January\nMan yeah you know one thing people don't realize is um springs need to be replaced it's you know cars when they you know the certain things that you need to do every so many miles in a spring replacements one of those things too so in the winter\nAs the metal gets more brittle because it's cold um that's when things like that can wear out and that's that's something I Know a bill Weber and his team to like a job or placing those uh those springs when there's issues there and that's something that you want to watch out\nFor you find a good good door contractor and let them do one so we're going in the winter\nNo doubt the key is to find a a reputable dealer or a ... there is as good as they come for sure [noise] um but if you're in a different part of the country what you want to do is you want to find someone\nThat is on the you know a better Business Bureau or another thing to consider is an ID A member that's our industry so that our industry is I'm backing them\nUm and you can also go to ... pay a door dot com and you can find a dealer on our list yeah and then you can you know anyone that we have out there would be a good deal

phone calls what do you say it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five bill welcome\nSir yes that's my question about the I have an older wouldn't garage door with one that was an a ha ha and um I had some issues with the top a section of it coming all the way forward to create the female I guess one or a\nVat and also what what is the weight of the store and shut up being replaced I don't even know how old they are\nWell [laughter] you know when they when you say could be replaced I ... you got any idea how that would ... thirty forty years old do you think\nI I don't know how it was a Nineteen fifty four I gotta believe it's been there ...\nYeah um well the stores are just there and light years apart you know it'd be a good investment for a couple of reasons bill I Would answer it this way number one is the new doors a will operate\nA perfectly they will operate quietly they will offer a huge insulation value based on what you have now um cosmetically it will be an improvement it will also return on its investment\nSo those are good reasons to replace it now if you decide no I don't want to replace it sounds like\nAt the very least you need to get a service going there to find out why those uh\nUh panels aren't folding properly could be something as simple as a strip screwing that hinges um are just getting loose and maybe it's jutting out too far and not folding down properly but uh the doors of today in the doors of a yesteryear\nIt's night and day it's like a comparing windows from fifty years ago when the you know the double insulated\nA replacement windows of today they're just they're they're not comparable\nYes or I had a friend told me that it's possibly a Crawford door ... I don't know why I\nMean I I got a guest said things at least fifty years old\nAt least for the area that the way they probably way at times right\nWell they're going away at least two to three times more than the new doors\nCheck yeah that's a double wide at sixteen by\nFoul my do you have a door opener on there I guess er I have a have a horse I'll bet [laughter] I can hear it right yeah yeah\nIt gets them out and take a look at it seriously or or just take a picture of a ... on their clothes pay a dot com website and just try on different doors I I think the appearance of the house\nIt's such a dramatic change anymore and garage doors I say this and and I I still stand by it I think it's the ... least costly improvement\nOr that you can make your house in other words when you get into buying a new garage door\nI I think in a lot of cases you'll be stunned at the price\n[laughter] what what do you think a a double wide like that what what cost just based on your knowledge\nIt just depends where you want to go I mean you can go low ball get the ... I mean you want some insulation in there you can get um a you know no windows no hardware and you might be able to do that for I don't know Eighteen hundred bucks\nOr you can get into the carriage house and and the and the polyurethane base in him super insulated and it's going to be more but a lot when you really think about the size of\nYou know from a curb appeal standpoint the difference for the size of the a product that's being replaced it it's huge it really is so close paid dot com take a picture uploaded change on some doors and take a look at they also have where you can even team up and match up\nUh your entry doors\nAnd that's kind of what they did on the HDTV urban oasis uh they're bright red\nAnd uh they do stand up its and I'll tell you it's not for everybody but um their stunning they're spending All right our phone number is eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five you can join us as we talk a little bit about home improvement those grip Frank Frank welcome\nYes yes\nI Can't remember the name of the older be gone or whatever odor exit uh-huh older and older uh-huh okay uh I get that at home depot\nNo on ... what you're going to need to do and they have to type she had the concentrate which\nIs more for a like animals that have been the accidents are skunks or something along those lines\nOr they have the magic which is just the odor eliminating spray you can find all of this it's online Frank you can also find it some do its best stores in a stores All right but the website is over the ... or X.\nI.

developed in a basement wall a cement block wall and um it's bulged out a little bit not action big then she's not falling down or anything and I've had some contractors then to look at it and I'm getting\nTo different types of advice\nOne wants to put five spring loaded I beams against the wall and the inside this to push it back but no excavation or clean out also there is some dampness on the bottom blocks\nAlong the basement floor the bottom blocks have dampness on them ... and a one wants to just push against the wall but not do anything about the drain outside or you know not excavate or may not be drains\nNeither one wants to bust out the cement floor inside and put a inside draining a ... ... and the other one's\nTwo other ones said the right way to fix this problem problem came from the outside you fix it on the outside\nAnd they said excavate that wall clean out jet claim they are drains that'll take care of the damage is at the bottom and then a a ratio the wall back so it was ...\nOh and then if you have to put a beam inside touch\nTo straighten out the wall which is pretty slight I'm there I Am with different advice well yeah well it's a\nHard hard to answer but I'm going to give you an overall first of all when you keep saying clean out the drains is their pipes around that foundation drain pipes around that foundation that are crushed her clogged or what's going on what are they keep dark\nI mean at the foundation at the bottom a well now we want to dig it up okay but well\nHere you know wall says eggs in Ben's unless there's a reason and that reason is always water\nOkay that's your number one enemy so water is an issue water is an issue on the outside and water is an issue underneath that floor\nI think what you're getting is you're getting partial answers but if you're really looking\nAt a complete fix I Would say you got to do almost all the above\nI'm the first thing you want to do is we don't know if those pipes are crushed we don't know if they're ... we don't know if they're plugged but we know the first two blocks or wet so what we do know is the water table was higher than the floor\nAnd now that may be during big monsoon rains but we know that that water table rises up saturate says blocks in comes in the way you correct that is you cut the floor you put in drainage pipes you catch the water as it comes up you rather to uh some pomp\nYou pump it away from the house you've solved the problem that's\nHow you saw the Fort problem that's one of the problems\nNow if you don't solve that problem really the best way to explain the bills if that water keeps going up and down and up and down I'm Talking about the water table up and down up and down those foot or start settling in that wall begins to bow\nAnd I think that's what's happened so the first thing I Do is you know cut the floor put in the underground pipes you run into some well in a mood the waterway that's part of the fix that's not the whole fix because the outside there needs\nTo be some excavation being done you need to run some pipes around that you need to catch the water to falling from the sky and neither Ponting around that foundation and you need to move that water away from the house\nSo then you're correcting the water around the foundation you correct in the water underneath the foundation you were then controlling all the water around\nThat foundation then you can address the wall now there's\nMultiple ways we can stabilize that wall um I don't know about this spring beams but there's beams any type of support to stabilize the wall is going to need to be done there is also one company that actually uses carbon fibre doesn't pull the wall back\nBut this carbon fibers applied over to the block which then stabilizes that wall\nStrengthens that wall and we've also eliminated the source that is making that wall bowl so you say it's a slight bow all we want to do is we want to make sure it doesn't do any more and we've done that by correcting the water problem\nAnd we've corrected that by putting a carbon fiber of the block which stabilized at Wal we import back but we stabilized\nNow they ah we never get water innovation and we just get damning assigned a box you know there's no water coming in yet\nOnly right and I think that they knew the answer yet yeah\nBut they uh uh you don't think just jetting out those excavating and getting out those are outside drains has gone out\nIf that's the problem you told me weren't even sure there was drains under there\nYeah there are because they have some pipes that run up um vertically okay all around the corners of the house they ran nice a plastic pipes\nOkay well I'll tell you why don't they found them for a gravel so are they found those pipes full of gravel okay and what was the purpose of that I have no idea okay that's how it was also\nI just told you how to you know completely waterproof and stabilize wall yes there are site things you can do I just can't promise that's gonna work\nYou know I always talk about killer jeeze and killer genes or this is what causes waters show up or I just what causes water above which sounds simple but it's what causes it it's groundwater\nGrading and gutters\nCutters get clogged water spills on foundation down about putting water right on the foundation that can cause it\nBad grading other words the ... slopes towards the house instead of away from the house that can cause it groundwater that's bonding around the foundation that can cause you correct all those you make correct the problem\nYeah we have good grading ... everyone that's come here says oh you got good\nDraining away from the house you know how to answer this way bill not to confuse you further I kind of show you the\nWhole system that eliminates the problem\nThat if a company does that they're going to do a lifetime warranty on it it's going to be more expensive than the others but you're done can you do the jetting out ... Ken\nWill solve the problem it might it might do it finally long term if\nI were to do one first to see what the result how it would you do the inside cut with a ... for the outside excavation with clean out first\n[noise] if I if you can tell me where that water is coming either coming up through the floor whether it's coming through that war I can answer that\nI got ya\nSee that's one kind of going falling back that whole thing that's why it's a system\nSo let's say they're coming from the floor down yes or right\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and if it's coming from up above that gets in your whole type thing and the grading thing that I was talking about the down spouse\n[noise] alright got a break we'll continue your at home with Gary Solomon\nFor your home is just a
