all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and\nHow we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your account max formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWhile we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list\nMagnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example with low levels of magnesium your heart beat\nWho very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so\nIt's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the ... formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paying\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account maxed formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei and\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rats or whatever right that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting on life you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and you're about it actually starting to manifest it\nWill all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic
