see how it's going to match up to the house okay because you'd have so many ways to vent different types of fire places now I tell you one thing I was at home not long ago they had a coal burning fireplace and they had a pellet stoves I don't know if you know what those are\nAll of it and it was a direct vent right through the back of that and it was really kinda fits motif for the house\n... coming all different kinds of sizes so I think I Would just gonna cut block out the whole uh gas log thing first\nEh let's see what's available in terms of pellet stoves aimed gas love I'm a ... to 'em in the direct vent\nAnd a kind of kind of figure out you know what's in your price range how's it going to line up to the house and go from there we're kind of backwards uh\nOkay see I thought they were on\nYou have an opinion on like a ... was a logs or or stoves versus\nYeah correct thing I I'm not a fan of the vent less never have been people that swear by him a but you're asking my opinion I'm not a fan of getting by it yeah I think a direct van is much better okay All right fair enough sorry for your time All right Tony thank you take care Bye bye yeah there\nAre so many very cool things you can do and if you're not familiar with the old coal burning fire places I mean I doubt if they're twenty four inches deep they're probably they're probably more like a Fifteen inches deep\nSo it's not like a big fire box so a stove and a direct vent or you know what you can get with a gas logs in which you can give us a ... really ideal for that situation but see what's out there in a kind of work your way back and I think you'll get your answer um let's see we go to Colleen Colleen welcome\nThat morning I have a problem with glass windows in my foundation ... at first I thought\nSomething was heading in them but it's not from Milan or they're not doing anything but the surface and the glass on the outside it's chipping off what's causing that\nHave no idea where they chipping\nWell just just a tiny little kept you know land on your cell like and I have no\n... shipping from the sides from that ... you have a glass lock from the surface\nYes nothing's happened on the inside the grounding looks fine\nOkay they are grounded in in in their shipping right in the center of the block right not on the edges right in the center\n[noise] any any place center and size center in the life\nI have no idea when you when I saw that it was chipping I Would think maybe on the sides are now it'd be some settling in that foundation creating some torque on a a ... glass block may have that happen I Would say the ... would fail before the glass now outlook\nK in the house are down in about\nSixty five so surely she said All right\nWell no it's not necessarily true there is that how can I don't know for a hundred years yeah also yeah so what I Would do I I don't have an answer for you and maybe somebody listening has experienced that Colleen I Would if it were me I'd probably call a couple of glass blocked ... and see if they\nEver heard of it okay I have not anything\nOffhand that I could\nUm [laughter]\nA liquid not a liquid no I Can't I Can't fix it

does a great job thank you very much\nRight thank you take care Bye bye by the way if you've ever heard of that and I am not I have no idea which will be causing a little tiny chips coming out of a glass book I too would think from lawn mowing shooting little rocks shipping some of the glass block\nShe said no it wasn't that I don't know how she would know what net but she said no it wasn't that uh but I've never heard of lists walk just lightly little chips in the center of the glass walk around the sides of the glass bug if you've ever heard of that ever experienced that\nUh you can do so

to work we'd go thirty three minutes after the top but they are kind of want to update you with the conversation I had with\nGail just to let you know uh what we're doing with day after we spoke off the air one of the things that I'm a originally when she was talking that maybe there was something wrong with the pain and I said well jeez you know there's usually I'm I don't know how much older than anything could be attributed to the\nPain itself and she contacted the representative and what was determined to that point when it wasn't drying as they may have used the wrong color and\nIn the solid color stain which was which makes sense that it wouldn't dry\nColor and for the most part and I'm Talking about generic coloring that used them ... or done them drank features which would extend the drank time which could allow for other sports to get in tangled in the sticky pain which could cause the growth now\nShe's talking about using all kinds of clear she talked about a thirty second cleaner which is a good cleaner\nI'm so that didn't work at all um use the wedding forget and that was about five weeks ago so sometimes a wedding forget to include the temperatures extends the active time so I don't think that was really given enough time to really work\nOr wherever we kinda left it is pursuing it through the bank company but in the meantime getting just a good grade of oxygen they bleach work on a smaller and scrub it see we can remove it\nFrom there because at this point where we have issues with\nThings around our house we don't know what that is when she was first talking one of the things and I didn't even address this with their\nUm and it didn't sound like it would be this but uh it it could be in some other cases um when you have mulch and maybe the sap and new hardwood mulch especially inexpensive hardwood mulch spread around your home\nThere is um [noise] a byproduct of that I guess I guess that's where you would say it is a cold artillery fungus\nOr shotgun from just so as a mulch breaks down it shoots these hard spores all over the wall on in glass I've seen them cars it's virtually impossible to remove literally\nAnd if even if you were moved with a razor blade ... off the glass or something or leave a little yellow stain\n[noise] well I don't think that's\nWhat her as she was I'm not really sure exactly what that issue was because we don't know what's on it we don't know what that stain or you know what's on it at all so we've had a couple of mysteries today\nAnd sometimes you just got to dig deeper deeper deeper I left with her like she needs to work it through the paint company and the store the wrong tent was used\nThat could have implications on many things on the outside of the house outside of just not drink properly alright\nEight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab aligned happened to take your calls as we marched through another weekend Sheila welcome\nHey Sheila hello yes I Am I really meeting we play and that my neighbor just had a\nGun nut house was what what are they had metal valleys and they knew that his\nFirst layer of I'm shallow and put on and what down and then some kind of [laughter]\nI don't know I think of something and then he put that new I ... everything by tiles and\nWho have told them they don't use the um metal valleys anymore and that caused problems and they're not as good I never heard that before so I came to you\nWell it's called a California weeds\nAnd or your roofers wrong they do use metal valleys they still use metal valleys of galvanized in pain them they use copper valleys in in my opinion I think those valleys are actually better\nUm versus a California we've uh California we've ease used by a lot of roofers\nBut um you know my opinion is I kind of like the metal valleys that doesn't mean you have to have him that's just my opinion\nAnd I'm not I'm not using that roof about before I went to look for a decade\nSo I Want it can now hey we only have one layer of child had take shingles I made her take off all the shingles it don't cut the shingle on top of an old one because they make them go [noise] um you\nCan put a second layer of shingles on top of an existing layer of shingles and it'll save you a little\nBit of money um I kind of go back to the thing is I probably wouldn't do that I'm\nA first of all a lot of roof worn teaser avoided if you go over in existing layer of shingles okay I'm also a um\nIt's always good to check what's going on underneath those shingles in case she had some water damage or something maybe some would needs to be replaced it doesn't give you a smooth the look and you're saving a little money but it's ... it's a little money it's not ...\nBut how how he can tell them about taking the original shingle off and putting stuff on the mall was correct yeah that's an alley\nI'm going to talk to the people I can hear 'em but before I talked to anybody I wanted to talk to you and make sure that I got how are\nYou in your ... and you bring up a really good point to Sheila because I'm I'm you know some refers to the California we even in swear by it okay but you know I'm saying I liked the mental valleys and the reason having these conversations is it's all about the quality of the roof or you\nKnow that other roofer he was good to he was saying chiefs I wouldn't put it over the old layer I really recommend stripping absolutely but I always say there's people ask me all the time what's the best shingle I said don't don't worry about single worried about the roof or get the best route for you Ken\nOkay now the next question what is the man in the valley ... over the California\nI'm not really sure I can tell you what the advantages it's more long lasting it's more it's less I'm more susceptible to being intact if there was a lot of wind\nOkay that you know ...\nAgain a lot also depends on the slope of the roof to gotta yeah then I Would like the mental valley\n[noise] well it probably would um you know ... ... moisture so where's the moisture coming from well right based on what you told me I could see about five areas where most you could be a problem [noise]\nWhenever you have a clash of temperatures\nUm that can take the humidity in the air and literally ring the moisture out of the year which would create moisture so the close even though they're not wet they would feel damp and if they're damp that's moisture and if it's growing on 'em so then the mould\nMould spores or everybody's house right okay and if you have moisture\nAnd you have organic materials so that would be caught ... or ... non synthetic ... okay and they got damp\n... can grow up so what\nWe need to do is we need to pay figure out um you know maybe those uh maybe there's not enough uh ... it could be it could be many things may maybe there needs to be some ventilation in the closet maybe there needs to be insulation on those walls and the ...\n... um but that that stuff I did have my house has taken that every child like I say the company [laughter] what was he did\nWhere did how did they what did they do in terms of inflation is if there is the insulation and the walls is that what you're saying at this point\nThere was a there is now I mean I'm tired of houses and fifty nine it probably was that I had that done about five years ago mhm it why is it a proper complaint job but it's better than it was so there is now ... that go on the outside they sprayed and stuff\nLike OK okay so there's some but not much so\nMaybe that fireplace sex should actually be drawing out the air but if it's creating a lot of heat and it's hitting a coal wall that could create some moisture\nUm the fireplace has wrecked behind it so it um ... definitely fine because of the way the fireplace halfway thought on the brick and up and the whole thing but paneling except cannot realm okay well\nTo answer your question will that pain in the middle ... take it out it it very well may what I Would do is go to the hardware store by a five dollar ... gauge humidity gauge will tell you what your humidity level is in the closet\nThey put that humidity gauge in the closet if it's over fifty percent right now I guarantee you that's the problem okay so that little piano than will drive the humidity down below forty percent in your problem will go away\n\nYou know what it was definitely work I've let me ask you for I've never heard back so that is a type ... test called the humidity gauge right hardware store so more like a ... for like an a hardware\nYeah yeah they did it just looks like a little round thing almost like a cooking some moment or would be without the probe you can just set it in the closet it'll tell you what you ... you might even play around with a little bit see where the ... family room\nAnd see where it is in the clubs is probably higher in the closet that's where the mold issues are and then you do middle far will bring that down opening the door that clause it'll probably bring it down\nUm but to just in the wintertime or humidity levels in center how should be summertime fifty percent wintertime forty percent I looked at mine last night my home humidity was forty five percent we're transitioning between seasons\nSo it's going down once it gets to forty I'm you know I mean ... that's when we try a little uncomfortable that's from an ad moisture\nBut uh that's where you want it fifty percent in the summer of forty percent in the winter my bet is that close it's much more humid than anywhere else in your home you need either open up the door run now do you ... and you'll solve your problem\nThat is awesome paycheck very much credit Charlotte thanks very good at it right\nAll right thank you Bye bye alright about six minutes before the top of the hour eight hundred to three eight to five five dead is the phone number and let's see where we go we go to Rob Rob welcome\nMorning just about a ... like I I got a project that I learned something I've never done before but I think with your help that just might be able to tackle this one All right I live in northeastern Ohio and I had an addition put on my house\nSome years back and it was not permitted that my\nGovernors replaced my wife reminded we're winding down spout short a builder kind of left us with a ... I'm\nWhat I'm Wondering is this a it'll be easier to have the guy that does the down about a story goes the gutters\nI Am at a run down to the ground for me I Know I have to put a forum quite grown and I can run it around the show's over to the existing\nA system underground but my question is is how do I need to go\nUh when I dig around the side of the house to put that hype and the ground\nOr you want to get you know probably where you're at you don't have to go below the ... probably Eighteen to twenty inches\nYeah it will be up against the foundational so\nI'd say kind of twenty inches and you want to have slope to make sure that water doesn't stand in that pipe right so you want to hear that I'm hope\nYup yup Yup I I I started that you can stop it makes no shortage fanfare I think I might be able to do this but uh yeah that's a great help that's what I call for the deaf but so\nI'm certainly important I Want to go down far enough up and trace weapons\nYup and and again with that slope you're not going to have a problem if you're twenty inches deep\nGet a good gravel base on there and uh and you're good to go [noise]\nVery good thank you much for the call appreciate it All right um well let me tell you about the [noise]\nWhat's going to go on in the next hour I think you'll find it interesting we're going to have our friends in from ... pumps and we're going to talk about uh what kind of backup pumps you want on your home\nYou want to water or do you wanted to battery operated [noise] so that's going to be well we're going to chat about and I know there's always some controversy about that but I like to battery says it's just I like the water because it does it will get a straight from our friends from law that's all up next [noise]\nAt the bottom of the next

let's create a ball for um for the temperature differential yeah that was my so kind of want to have a say or yeah if you you know you've got a can of Pepsi on a hot day we're going to put a hug yard it\nOkay All right but if you if you start getting a little too creative and we we did for years we used to um\nI remember building basements and we were put insulation where the paper face on there and wrap it in plastic and what would happen is the insulation it'd be wet because the water vapor becoming through the walls\nAnd that's where a lot of the water vapor come through the concrete walls right and it was hit that water vapor or that vapor barrier and ... there would be nowhere for to go so the condensation would be created behind a wall and then we had all kinds of problems\nWell that's what a fern strip leaving airs fish it was ... it\nWould but you could still have enough where maybe that air could get in there and still create condensation because it wouldn't be Snuggie against the wall\n[noise] out of that yeah so you know I mean if it were me what I Would do is I Would\nSee whereby humidity is I Would really work hard on controlling that my guess is that\nMiddle fire probably isn't too isn't big enough\nYou're still running a really high humidity counting there are some phone panels that are open cellphone panels or get some really construction and he's in a

worrying in it\nAnd it's a lifetime warning thoroughly\nWell Greg you bring up a good point we're talking to people from all over the country and they they may not have an ever growing their\nArea but what Greg said is a mouthful and that is a multi step system\nMany times Greg we get calls on this show and they want to know if they should address the outside the should dress in such address some Walsh addressed the floor yeah and they're really the only way you're actually ever going to totally eliminate the problem is address it all\nThose outside and then\nAnd then that's why they can offer a lifetime warranty and there's many companies you know in other parts of the country that kind of go by that same philosophy it's a project you do not want a piecemeal\nYeah well you don't want them to come back and read it have to redo your any water problems that come back\nRight and if you just do one part of it quite honestly the other parts could get worse\nYou know I always say to people tape you do that where the water go where's the problem going to be in the ... when he me so we stopped at here and it's like putting your finger on a dyke\nThat's right [laughter] this charge out from your from your point yeah you're courting grain\nSure sure well I'm Glad you had a great experience Greg thank you very much for the call appreciate it thanks very\nAll right take care of excellent then that that is a ... you know it's nice that he called um but it's also nice to be able to\nKind of point out the fact of why it works because they know many people you know this sufferer you have a leaky basement and that's a challenge but you know it starts outside or you know you you got a check to make sure leaves rally gunner you gotta check make sure the greetings right you gotta\nMake sure that the down spouse or taken all that water away kind of work on all of those things I get that those things you can control but if you worked on all that\nAnd you still have that problem you you got a problem and it's just not that crack in the law you can ...\n... where is that pressure so anyway that's nice Greg thank you much a day walk them\nHey I heard a lady call in about the uh the fracturing block windows\nLittle tiny chip some glass popping\nI've seen that before All right and I know what it is and and in that case to the uh the grout will look fine except for one small hairline crack at the bottom okay All right so what's happening or at least in the case that I saw those may be true at that person's house\nUm if we're here in Ohio or Kentucky Andy I got the clay soil they use\nAll right all summer summer\nJust ... creating stress\nRight so if there's any if there's any have especially if that say a effect that window is close to ground level\nOr even if it's not even if it's a walkout face for example if there's if there's any step fracturing in a box on nation or any vertical fracturing in a port foundation near that when\nThere is going to be rotational stress on glass right and it'll start shipping from the outside but you'll start seeing ships in the middle especially if the silicone or it he said that they use to join the blocks together\nThese were around well as crowded it was so crowded in ... even between the block yeah that's what she said\nOkay so in that case you have the flexibility what so throwing rocks or you can see that this fractures coming to the games because all that stress is getting transferred through their right and you'll see pops coming out of the mental\nBecause when you when you crack the edge you're also creating a sub surface fracture in the surface of the center of the glass\nOkay you\nKnow it'll eventually fall out you know you're you're right on target David in fact one of the things that kept and I said I I personally have never had that experience I said called glass block company they probably have and that experience and that's the Lucian yeah okay I\n... it was it's twofold first you don't crowd each block um the the the more flexible ... when it was actually have a silicone it's almost like a call\nBut surely not he says that run also functions as a call between the blocks today\nSo it has a little bit of gift to take some rotation and and not crack okay we'll break or allow ships to form on the inside when do before you start seeing him on the outside and the other part of it is\nOn that one of those install as a single piece wants to spend silicone stalled as a single piece sugar center and then sell the opening a with with the expandable so a lot like\nThe great stuff ... not not but not the triple expanding it's alright right below the window right ... yeah\nSo low expansion but but solid so and then you do want that crowd so you're trimmed back this is a little extra work you've got Trump back on it\nTo them and maybe three quarters steps and then we're out on both sides mhm so\nThen you got your ground and then as you do have a ground he then like route will fractures\n[noise] okay okay and so and he won't blow out the window\nRight so okay I I just I mean the part I missed\nWas the chip on the side of the block that creates a surface crack\nWhich causes the chipping in the center of the block that's the part I couldn't forget I knew it had to do with this you know the stress the twist and all that but the center of the block had me a had me messed up a little there Dave Dave's thank you very much for your explanation very thorough and I appreciate the call will continue urine home with Gary Solis\nHome improvement

basically what they're doing um the what they did with the petri dishes was they obtained\nUm what we call themselves these cells that can pretty much generate any kind of tissue and they fed these

getting some or all\nOf the recommended ... the percentage of children under two years old who hasn't received a vaccination has quadruple\nIn the last Seventeen years according to the federal health data release Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention Dr myself what does this mean\nWell Morris I basically means that we will continue to see outbreaks of diseases that we thought we had overcome this is important because\nDiseases like measles for example\nJust this past year there was a an outbreak in Minnesota and I'm and up to Seventy five people attracted measles and when they that the investigation what they learn was that there were people who are missed informing the Somali American communities\nAbout vaccinations and so some of those people abstain from uh vaccinations and there you go you had had a patient just recently who\nWas a pediatric patient and urgent care I you know in the waiting room I heard this um\nAnd I heard this this this kid screaming was she was about seven years old literally screaming in pain it turns out eventually\nAnd when they got to the back I'm sort of Roma evaluated a patient I discovered the patient had something called Titus media which is basically an ear infection\nNow the parents both parents were presence and they proceeded to ask me if there is a natural\nWay of treating oh Titus media um I\nResponded that I'm there might be ... I but I'm not familiar with the natural cure\nUm the fact that the hearing the clinic and liked to prescribe some antibiotics right um so this kid and maybe a little bit of steroids I'm so that this kid can um start feeling better quickly\nWhile they were they happened to be naturalists and they declined the treatment and they left the clinic without treatment\nRefused they declined the um\nThe prescription and so those were those people that family was a naturalist they and they didn't believe in vaccinations or anything so you know I'm so you walk the walk was fine line\nAnd respecting families decisions and their values and at the same time it it pains you to see that someone suffering\nUm because of you know it could be just a lack of insight so in two thousand and one there were there a point three percent of children who went unvaccinated okay now that number according to the CDC with these new data that was a that was released on a Thursday one point three percent now\nSo in the past couple of years has been eight million children born in the United states okay so you should put that in real numbers comes down to a small figure somewhere around um you know about a hundred thousand children but\nIt's it's still a significant number and I mean this is twenty Eighteen and I and now you also have to think about they also in the studies show that there was a discrepancy between children who lived in rural areas versus children who live in\nUrban areas there was discrepancy um where the children who tend to live in\nFar rural areas were are less likely to be fascinated those also I'm a correlation made between vaccination in private health insurance so\nFor people with private health insurance the unvaccinated numbers were a lot lower and for people or with or without", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "El Paso", "day": "28"}
