radio six Ninety Katie as Sam\n... and it really when you look at how Donald Trump is reflecting a the ... will it really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today this is the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure\nAnd it goes through the Eric Holder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low Isay hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for 'em\nWhen we when that's when civility concert again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I'd taken behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic what's the difference between\nThat and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back\nTwice as hard well I mean I I you know that ... what they're saying they are trying to pose as Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves at the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I started out in clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw all of the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized writing but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that it's complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility said lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip\nService to a lot of times what made them almost unbeatable for the average\nPerson right they they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least tried to hide it\nThis way which is now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said there's no ... is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic part and it's amazing\nHow they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the the that was his deal mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd that ... that they would have followed Malcolm X things might have been worse\nFor ... for ah for blacks for a while\nI mean you're back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want\nThey don't want to think of themselves as no as you know animals harassing innocent people in the restaurant and that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people mhm right and you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in a totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal\nHuman instinct and that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to ugly I don't want that\nI mean there was an actual death in Charlottesville right yeah yeah and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and who's going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\n[laughter] they just won't recognize it uh and you know who on the left\nStanding up against that\nWho's

mean are we talking a but he goes to the next us database and he figured oh Rush Limbaugh doesn't believe in climate change jokes people with more than just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy [noise]\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my chili listened to this story this is from the federalist papers Liberace professor says hurricane victims deserve what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this you know they're going to make up the fact\nThat a bunch of people like me who know oh that climate change man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything floating risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota verbal and fluids sciences professor Dr John\nAbraham he's a professor actually\nBelieve the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because\nThey elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag\nOr a penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it this is the watch chicken the reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\n\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserves to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans\nAnd his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane ever hit the panhandle\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction under ... so\nThis clown who is disguised as a as a an engineering professor literally is saying that if you wanna stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally there's one that's what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of ... which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I I I don't know what the nature of the heck's is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if if it weren't so irresponsible it would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dennis simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you now do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally weren't trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so whatever people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents would have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing when he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service\nTo downplay the warnings well I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking on a tax on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThe Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy is professor at the University of St Thomas is no different\nBy claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be\nAnd whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck\nRiviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida bloat both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we looked at these events are these people do as one off political events [noise] some of these people who have been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with I mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives\nOr it is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know I densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the people who lived there ... there were some who didn't evacuate and they made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how raucous these Starman storms aren't they want to see it\nAnd they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you [noise] takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw just today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change\nSo see if we hadn't just\nNot gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop ... stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else to hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how to bending how author leap politically\nPartisan by the way it was it was getting ... book on it like clockwork\n\nJust today here come more intense

the problem is I mean\nLike oh yeah she does ... the problem is they're trying to scare everybody into signing onto this because it's it's classic if you sign on to agreeing to the whole premise of

on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or John ... the Democrats blue wave is drying up oh if that will be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly governor twenty Eighteen mid terms still point to a good a great night for Democrats they are the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet we pointed out that all of these Nash\nIt'll generic polls show this gigantic wave but if you go race by race if you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot the lemon name on it by this time when you start pulling people among three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name in the question what do you think the result is gonna be\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the majority in the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other seats if they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's\nAnd it goes state by state to show her and this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional year party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities already in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of thousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys know\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought\nOf and categorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Morsi an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred\nAnd sixty different articles so the trick is how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get it distributed and how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political evil but a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about want an abortion murder there is not a lot\nOf hardly any abhorrent\nGore and violence in the movie it's it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics\nBut it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nMass murderer he was a mass murderer of people\nIn the womb that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even\nAnd this trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached journey of ads\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human and viable tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain is one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a God sell himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess or as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking ours here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of\nRip pulse live Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people\nWhat their careers with a line of agreeing to appear and start even Searcy a directing\nHas this week in
