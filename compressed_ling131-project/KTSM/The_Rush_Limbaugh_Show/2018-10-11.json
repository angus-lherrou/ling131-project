else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's because they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when there are those the right one were silent and they they are so

together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discouraging us enough and they could not go up that's the only way they win but Republicans of conservative stand up\nWhen every single

when he was first setting himself up in Washington he just trust the members of his team\nHe cited Nikki Haley who announced her resignation as weak as an example of the great people who now feel his administration he said he's going to do away with people he doesn't like are there so am I Am not in love with yes we're going to weed them out slowly well she said that ... there's just not coincidence\nIf it was not happenstance so ... and Trump both are putting that in the west wing on notice\n\nA Trump also said we'll get to it we'll get to it I thought what a jumping up and it's going to the audio soundbite starting with number seven teams sorry sorry sorry uh Thirteen [noise] this is Trump\nCalling in to Fox and friends that I was talking to Steve do see a do she said you took some heat yesterday Mr President for going ahead with that rally in Pennsylvania despite the hurricane\nThat really had very little eat other than the natural haters of which there are obviously some we have thousands of people lined up by the time either make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and\nYou know that area obviously has not affected at all by it and we had it on a great

show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do\nThe hurricane was going to do what it did and there is nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so\nThe next question from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric

be\nCareful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's worth discussing ... is a very dangerous ... older [noise] what is held in contempt by Congress colder when after

convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would incur some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in\nThe face of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it I Believe it looking our\nPolling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that's what I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we

and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling

wary of looking back watch what's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir and the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which where pledge to accept the election results and Trump said no\nI'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election columns that we've counted the boats\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite\nTrump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThe drugs have you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American yes that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win a landslide than the soundbite would be on the head like we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up they said no I don't know what kind of shenanigans if people go to play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nIs the biggest threat to our democracy when you're a member\nThere may be saying that this is an unwritten sold them Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump Williams just the only election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump and openly speculated that the election might be read during his mind a little bit with Clinton October the Nineteen if you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would concede that\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical better roads Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligent just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\n\nRoads seems to have a problem with English Trump was asked a

and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and condo leaves a rice\nAnd a bunch of ex presidents and they were\nGoing to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get Colin Powell and cause delays or rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this\nRussia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use it you're pro last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more [noise] that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the oligarchy she overcame rush and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the
