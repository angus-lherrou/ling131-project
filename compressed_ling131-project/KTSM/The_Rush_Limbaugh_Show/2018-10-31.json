Service\n[noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN stuck in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... women says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight formal about all the recent shootings in mailed to pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky\nAnother white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what is your reaction to this I mean this punks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's not on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTransform America away from\nThe traditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded now terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using the victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching\nIf you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're going to if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is that that's an raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics you mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are the Republicans in that group\nLooking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk in the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope

that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then they had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don

... ... they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became\nA standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo\nGoogle CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what I Want

headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent\nUh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program and look for\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one of ... usually anytime the plane goes beyond that many people especially if it was a brand new planet\nNow what are you such a brand new playing what kind of plant was he was bullied will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's

thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd\nNot as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's not be and they have a mix of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down\nBut it

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets and his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade\nOn this it's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs that why is it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the foreign what her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present as any but the media and the Democratic\nParty were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is the passes it gets to convert gets ... get the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it if Kavanaugh was such a rotten\nS. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all just it's going on is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway\nIf the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political\nDont for which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital of us accused of being was actually cruise they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there's a big campaign going Kevin always will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions are being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her\nNot Jimmy made public thing I'd do it terrify here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you have any debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents they still oppose Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... are opposed Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win reelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one if the cabinet confirmations circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women\nInstead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice\nUh so it's it's going to be self contained on the watch but for people that do not have a watch are not going to get one McCarty a device\nHere for Ninety nine bucks and Amazon are from cardio if if it ... or something you tend toward or thank you it's hereditary in\nMany cases than this thing

right\nThank you so much for taking my call\nI was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession at school day was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my own class called courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history but the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is one needs and millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by it the ship\nEspecially looking after I used to take a device and lick open up\nThe upper I live and if you had a disease called trick coal mine you will automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship doctor perform kids examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want anyone could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then\nWhere am I that's what people are thinking listening to you tell a story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paved with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one have you on the streets\nBut we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me\nTo listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will hold a lot of everybody not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about it kind of history he's going to be learning it so I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books oh wow you know very was because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it you're not gonna learn it from his own history books now all we fight they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know John Silver at Boston University of Washington\nThe way back in the nineties did a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard Zen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a ... a socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nThe vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much I'm Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about el as it was it not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were a much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the\nImmigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed into propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the\nDay holy smokes now let's go to the audio soundbites vis\nVis folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin

protesters singing this land is your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome only stop what they perceived to be his it's all on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here corpus hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they wish they would just

I'm some Robert Six days to the mid term elections and there is feverish campaigning coast to coast in Florida there are too tight races both Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican rather than just want to be governor but Gillum tells NBC's Today show that the SAT as his running a dirty campaign\nEverybody in the world out there just agreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that\nThe closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody to Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives 'cause everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election and the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the

men terms and her final stretch\nAnd I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\n\nOn certain days alone is midterms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten men germs are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states or the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any ... because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not in this trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... do you can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval\nIt is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the ninth teens are representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things [noise]\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge it Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven and all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable arms on this thing and then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next ... what is it\nEarly voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before 'cause the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens to go to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\nWhat else is working out very well that's\nProbably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh them\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are ten surprises regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such an event you out on the bottom line I happen to live this idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best
