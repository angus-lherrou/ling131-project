steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started ab and see I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work and it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one thought it was necessary to do\nAnd it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ...\nI have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number then that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and one in four or no jobs was about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign I promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the press maybe even longer than I maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad me me\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having the it was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement does it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country an overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking but I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen all of this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us

believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed\nAccording to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent of\nRepublicans who are the smart ones\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone\nWas credible twenty three percent fought Kavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should have some of the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one\nWay Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships\nFrom forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning meaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got a call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nThing no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there is no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm\nPart of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in many germs are ... they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks that all of\nThis is going to backfire on the Democrats and motivate\nRepublicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again\nFor Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning\nRachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the plural evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nLook I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after they've gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me\nPredicting Republican doom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh's those Republicans guaranteed to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based\nAt a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if the Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral\nAnd I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this this uh CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenience on whether or not Kavanaugh gets through I think the whole situation that's really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production\nWas everywhere I literally all over the world it was on Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea is\nA rock and roll lovers Sandy West here to take

step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness and

oval office was during a\nAn announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive vice were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls that are on very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that ended up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Cuban a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is it\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what I'd change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one and the plastic yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me ... let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number

paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not going to vote\nFor a vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least a lot of weight walking into this\n\nSo they're going to be he runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trapped accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are thanks to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK\nThank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do\nThey move on it will just tell ya if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels say to which the response as

you and the radio what hey Katie or whatever we the headline on the Drudge Report let me read it to her you're White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on a lake Eyre what it is [noise]\nRight here at my formerly look at the same fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview anyone\nNecessary for Kevin inquiry this is because of what they claimed Trump said at his press conference today where he's\nNow I don't want to limit anything I said guys don't have to admit that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations withdrawal I'm not that's fake news so then they've got a record Trump not limiting and best which means you can go on and on and on and on\nAnd now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and right on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to this\nAfter Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with the woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit name was they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller they stop\n\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs a stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of bread capital\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and said they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the capital has been half baked lukewarm and\nIncompetent because of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\n\nSomebody look we got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it he did no such thing but\nHe sure Fela for debate I Am not limited to anything I've totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them properly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here really really screw on the porch and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\nNot rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know\nIs that [noise] and one other thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen a go go watch it's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was rich hunter he's the guy that you know
