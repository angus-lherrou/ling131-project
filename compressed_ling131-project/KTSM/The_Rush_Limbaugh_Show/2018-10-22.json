media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they wouldn't be\nCovering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on your show game\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known weather's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that\nWas not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if they're behind that was one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about setting the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they have rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated\nFamilies the border and how Trump didn't all white ... infant didn't want it to last so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still mayor ... year about peace yes they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell\nYa if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt\nIs the right word but they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some Republicans are behind this than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be somebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden it aside all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decided to start walking to a thousand miles we don't\nSee pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see in our day just urinating and rivers and streams of what would the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street I mean get maps and San Francisco for tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing to begin or just hit the southern border may go they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know how many miles a\nDay you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest for the next\nDay that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real Linda that's over three months\nAnd the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may

we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them are also deeply conservative violence provoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizes the care of it by the way the\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised\nThe stakes last night at thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into Michael claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the day\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want their when their\nRight mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration now right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night palm pale who met with the Mexican president\nOn the offensive alleging at a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about\nThis I think it's a classic illustration of how this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nEnough to know what's best for being driven solely by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any\nThe common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and say to the world come\nOn in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as\nAn entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nAnd everything you need to stay informed news radio since Ninety caveat them [noise]\n[noise]\nYeah I'm going to get to that CNN [noise] CNN playing an impartial ... invited me to make it look

lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert by again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWell you can use the military because of the positive comments out of ... that normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military just stopping invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way into\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is what is one of seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized says the border if they\nBomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and\nPut everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly and so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else's but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous

about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it

to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the present and here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not\nCross okay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the

they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nThat I still you know I ...

are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of Santa's last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive\nTo some of the when an Obama like way a would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just\nFilled with love and compassion the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about evil just talking about Florida as a collective that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or all collective\nHe hit it would be a disaster\nFor Florida right now do all like anybody like\nThis guy because of what he will do in racking\nA growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing white gang busters and you and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right in this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be and the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair if it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism\nFor them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that you didn't look that up a would just be\nJust bad news horrible news of being Zach worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor uh in in Florida\nRick Scott's the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackles a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and Nelson has become a just a static flat line\nJust a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever leftist leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit to Florida or not\nBut the Santa would be great defense as as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nHere and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have are\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president\nTells you this is as good as it gets when you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really was undeserved we wave stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I\nCan't I Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump to support it because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt\nAt transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob\nSeven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states being caused there deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\n\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen\nSuccessful\nAmerica needs to be punished whatever\nElse is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nParty you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited\nExtremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway I mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put put
