S. mothers who are not citizens including illegal immigrants the president was interviewed on X. files on HBO\nIt needs to be addressed every effort the Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition everywhere and yet\nWe have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may\nGo with their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to just just just being ... up that Trump's base that the\n... implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again a classic\nExpression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are just voted for Donald Trump who remain supportive of\nDonald Trump [noise] but back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I run into these people at the event last night it's going to\nBe a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are committee chairmen not all but many of them are committed\nChairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats\nHas has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes\nSome of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they have and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign resigning members of Congress retiring maybe they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are set up\nAnd they are sophisticated and the people who are elected Trump and know exactly what's at stake they're not going to stay at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand six day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr ... and Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nAs yet when Robert my great\nBook grading the presidential election in two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative here a long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained opt in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red pill\nA movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case\nOr in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive buys with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations\nUh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco la marrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events\nThese false surprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was no I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bomb so some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these\nFalse surprises and other events while intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house all of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating or building a blue wave and a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded blue wave by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats\nWin everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and that's not that's not a blue\nWave a blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue way were designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nBut I think inclusion is it there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple\nThat you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip some little bubble\nIt's the

I I think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and\nIt's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's I'm\nA ... it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the blacks\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game that we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were polished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why you should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo ... for citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I may never there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but\nWe suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods are Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians\n... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there is no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company got we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up as being set in the media you know it's all\nAimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that not Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah\n[laughter] look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here\nWhich has to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUm maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries\nThere their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's ... and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people are capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world\nAnd otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a sure political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI Know has a George Soros I think George Soros his name has become um like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done\nDo it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a\nJam in Madison,
