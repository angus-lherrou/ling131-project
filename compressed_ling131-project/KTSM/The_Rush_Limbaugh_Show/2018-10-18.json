thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in\nEither there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion\nImage growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here very close to the election and for

are figuring it going to play out now we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and that it is ready to go\nI went

released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations in this instance I'm we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've

I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for\nThis somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities\nSomebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here\nI guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help but this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at\nThe southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\n\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere\nSomebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe started by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see other than just\nThe general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because\nOf the Trump that Trump weren't there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp letting head back to the
