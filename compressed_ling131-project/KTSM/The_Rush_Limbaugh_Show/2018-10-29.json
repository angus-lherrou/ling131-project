to bad indeed do the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly\nWorn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up to during the Obama ad ...\nThe ... there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nTo say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\n\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\n\nA bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to end up their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens the Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets ...\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of the political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do anything they can to get\nRid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person it did it\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link\nThe Trump well I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from a weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked in we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything

midterms are going you pretend to ratchet these two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\n\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now but I ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans wants this stuff starts they tuned out they're fed up with being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out they think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support stalls you have the support black lives matter and they weren't condemned there weren't\nAny consequences for the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about\nThe shooter in that in that in ... the Mike Brown good order first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store and salt and whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump\nNow it it it it gets it gets to the point that if if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now\nBecause of this nobody believes what'd you say nobody\nTrusts what you're

with it they are advised to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political\nStunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he's most just sit there and take\nYou wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was mayor and while his family was threatened and why his life and future we're in the process of being

afterwards everybody forgets it everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed\nTo fight for him so Trump ditto not supposed to

front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to armed with the school police and it was voted down to one\nWell the thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a Mayor Bill Clinton was very drawn very liberal\nOut and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need more gun control I mean how many more things that happen before they realized it more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this is\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh\nThere's no amount of death\nThere's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is seen as supportive but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than\nThat it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned\nThis let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with um [noise] Trump himself that says this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at Fort Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter\nSaid Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nSee sowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first\nQuestion a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and on and tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here\nAnd that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a

did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they they they yeah I mean a lot of them\nOh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because one thing to\nSay that yes because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also and tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think as a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThird willing they're willing to claim the victim had nothing else [laughter]\nWell one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal Jew is like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it it's it's a Jewish state and yet there is there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti the religion and it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in their religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from religion I don't think you can and that you know any any time you're Jewish and you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation\nWith liberal and Israel comes out no way that it's a disclaimer\nI'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything Israel feeling that that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but I\nI don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward it is I mean you see this they're anti Christian to do um I don't see them as necessarily being\nSeeing Islam but I you know but I think it's the it's a it's a ... I got\nJust ... that's exactly right I was wearing misses all headed this is all headed toward atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the Web or whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes Emmy judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else that there is no\nUltimate power that can meet out\nApprove or disapprove of ones that's been one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nI I just I'm so ... how this of this event\nBurn given everything else that you say that you are all the liberalism that's creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people\nTalking about it so this event in Pittsburgh than it does it add to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nI mean I I I don't I don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there are targeting\nI'd choose in a way that they would Monica she'd have to bring it on I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because the country it's so great that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the near term or anything silly like that\nI Am glad you said because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much\nRachel I preach as racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um [noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipelines none of them went to explode it what do you\nThink the odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\n\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump\nI have I have an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with is\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nEnd of the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they've been on this is that this has\nTo be what it is their thinking and they\nJust can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president or he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how it's Washington the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes ... says what's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws
