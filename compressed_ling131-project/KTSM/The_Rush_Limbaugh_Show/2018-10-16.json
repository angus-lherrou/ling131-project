[laughter] how\nDid you eat they were just so blasted but says why you did see him with his shirt off so that was good for them stay away from alcohol yeah I could do some really good you should see it\nEr yeah er and er it did me doing very well or at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie\nHave you seen what does it first in the first man first man have you seen that\nI haven't um though I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding that movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out that they didn't put the scene of than planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of\nThe story I mean but the the the argument was is not is showing is making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches of the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know the the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah All right um but we now uh now I've not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and\nFirst of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like they just a patch or yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you what it's not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background but it was already been planted there and they show it if they were voting the flag they just don't say to that moment not good enough what if those forty year old women are they like has hired a\nCabinet and was there it is so it's kind of\nA couple of bottles or started hey you might not understand that but I mean are we not just the victim here of of of the\nBudget the outrage I like it does not seem to be a thing no it most of it's not most of it's not this okay today there's a\nTweet from Donald Trump oh did he say something crazy of course he did at that point from Donald Trump today we're also talking about a war\nAnd Elizabeth Warren's Cherokee heritage why why he does this matter\nI mean you know again we

one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand\nIt to include South America\nWhen other reason there isn't much into your DNA is because they are very very wary of\nThe Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine lineage they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is it's amazing and that story I get that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilized\nIn a in any of this\nBut ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American\nDNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her get hammered take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he meant that she\nWouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies Trump is causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\n\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this\nBlue wave business\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is gonna be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting\nPatterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all\nIn two thousand ten [noise] do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nThe Democrat Party glossed over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses\nA governorships\nAre you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead and sat lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep big never going to wipe out\nThe Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination somebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed older polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixteen elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\n\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago\nSo from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead\nWhat people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence\nIs this going to happen what is it that has to stop the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party\n... on the basis of what if you take a look\nAt Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no real Trump hasn't done anything to worse than anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey\nSoaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand Eighteen\nThis is the CNBC polar survey\nAmerica is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen now we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means\nEmployers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with\nThat many job openings it is and employ ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience on whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nBe unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were very by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including the two thousand six to ... presidential election\nFor\nThose of us shouting at me why but we're rushed on food so we won the popular vote ... yeah but\nHas that Hillary certainly does and they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had I've never really they or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near the lake is\nDonald from you know what this is like is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some ... the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave a radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who'd never done it before as the rush killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that\nWas going to steal the limelight away from this program then Air America came along and uh and\nThey did the same thing and it never has happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they want you may think rush the enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest\nFolks you may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you Hillary Clinton could withdraw fly just\nDo a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons\nCompanies not waiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple

rid of Donald Trump nothing has turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs I'm somebody there as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational\nSanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh\nDon't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't lead whether that was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew the balls before I could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked at balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that a fifth\nAnd one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom

or damaged or harmed her yelled out or whatever\nUh anyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the\nReal objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for us to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they have been able to do that\nGet Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and into the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't any evidence\nThat one of them are at such a thing but the Democrats didn't care\nThat there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\n\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties in Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ...
