all of these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November but it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the center in the house in the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no one picture of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in their cars\nNever vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave been generic battles advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans but you know there's a lot of talk all with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republicans but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm an only get a little ... observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then you know nine months ago the Democrats\nHad a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em and Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything let me remind you\nOf a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I I Know one

is that allow the players to make friends leave that send away Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that was checked stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their bets half the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've\nMade layers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known at the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you were doing you were making ... guessing somebody you're probably were certain a bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time or third quarter finish do your job\nSame thing here polls in January\nIn front of a November election doesn't mean anything\nPolls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not have contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none ... zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of ... out\nNow all of a sudden house races\nAre tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't want anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that predicted\nA mind went viral and Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me start ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me predicting all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them\nThey run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win and the people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that will

challenge the White House ought to be issued a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio [noise]\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio is is that by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make\nThings up and strategize I Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick that was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a\nCover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine gutted artist did his\nCartoonish interpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead
