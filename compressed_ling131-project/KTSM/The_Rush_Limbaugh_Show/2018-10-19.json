majority American people might want that\nI understand I agree with him completely doesn't make any sense of Democratic Party doesn't deserve to be winning anything just on the basis of the way they

fixed\nWhatever problems they have ... or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument of the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and when you're synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to promote self reliance they don't want to promote rug in individual lives and they don't want to promote people dealing with life\nFixing situations dealing in facing adversity and overcoming it becoming better people they want people to remain in that incompetent dependence grown up in a mass thinking the government is the solution and the solution is not really a solution\nThe solution that

into going against his instincts\nThey've been trying to do is that since the campaign they have failed practically every effort they've made their die\nTo be able to say they pressured and Trump into doing something you didn't want to do because he's afraid of them and they think they're getting close when Trump's out there saying yeah it looks like a show you died looks like it's a pretty good rep because she'll be\nThey think they're getting close and they're all jammed up in their own tree and they're all getting more jazz\n[noise] for this that's why we tells you hope to show is not because anybody thinks he deserves to die but the media never tells you the truth about anything not anymore not work concerns Trump\nHow many of you think let me just ask your question [noise] remembered this faceless\nNameless on non ... op ed that ran in the New York times supposedly written by somebody in the Trump inner circle in the west wing talking about how bad it is in there how dangerous lead childish an immature\nTrump is how unprepared how ill equipped how in competent how risk we all are\nBut then we were assured by whoever wrote this thing don't worry there are adults like us that are protecting this country from President Trump and you can count on us to commit well everyone is who is this who wrote this and they began circulating names do you notice we don't have

for the fame alone for the media accolades alone\nAnother thing why hasn't been forgotten\n\nI mean it's still a pretty damn big deal that there's that kind of a traitor inside the west wing why is it been forgotten because it didn't work that's why they're on the other things have you noticed there's no news about Russian collusion\nYou noticed that why is that because it's not a big\nDeal to people getting ready to vote it's not and if you on which people's votes will turn that's why the media dropped it\nThey try to make it the issue they did everything they could to make Russian

twenty four seven because this was how the drive by media working with the Democrat Party was going to get rid of Donald Trump\nAnd yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for removed from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush same pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all been about\nHaving Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not\nTwo years down the road day how many times that they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's nuts if they they want him out of office every day now the failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls e forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of cabinet as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his past his future no problem that's what they were trying to do\nChristine balls the four Stormy Daniels a porn star became a hero to the Democratic party and her creepy\nPorn star attorney Michael ... who was then towers in as perhaps a Democratic Party presidential front runner for twenty twenty\n\nAnd Donald Trump's taxes that was an issue that\nWas ever investing below the surface for the entire time and then there were a couple of days where it made the lead\nHow about the shooting\nAt the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida\nAnd the creation of a couple of new Democratic Party activists camera hog and I forget the other one\nHow long did that story go on how big a star did they turn camera hog into and where is he now where is the issue of gun control where is this story and that young people\nHigh school and college students who had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus that government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the un alright where\nIs that today what [noise] but oh\nCamera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening\nOr a moment but none of it is organic or real what do you mean Russia's neighbor to Hong Kong he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David ... doesn't have an audience David hog did not literally create a bond neither does okay seal ... these people do not have\nConnections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump paths are like other successful people and media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women want to see it nobody saying where's hog\n\nI'm that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script material\nWhat's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton was affected link killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did anything\nWrong with Monica Lewinsky she was an adult she was consenting adults jihad Maya ...\nShe was a consenting adults I knew what was it\nNot abuse because Bill Clinton knew that she was an adult\nOr by by me too movement\nI mean if the ... that ran the bimbo eruptions unit to destroy women claiming her husband abused them comes up not to defend her\nGuy what good is the maids to move\nAgain another manufactured moment it hit by manufactured my my point about all these is none of these issues or people have the legs to survive on their own without the media\nWins the

I Do remember that way and I are way back then I ... back you go\nI I've been way back before that even so uh but hey I've got a theory about this caravan the last two years there's only one\nThing that the Democrats won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income trumpet caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that for this time just to put an exclamation point on and to emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it\nThat the idea to flood the border\nTo demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't yes don't call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these are one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nThere's all the time so are your are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\n[noise] no I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that if he wants to do their\nNext year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... I all I can say these are smarter than than I Am\nA navy but but I\nDo see that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding the zone with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over oh I\nDon't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nBut my question is what else do they got ...\nOh they've gotten my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the\nThat's the uh well that's exactly right and right there that's\nWhat's for and the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats can't stop anything in the house and they can in the Senate\nWhat what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to Todd I Want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nLeaders in both parties do not want that ball\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[laughter]\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... the ...\nI think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think first it's certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow\nReversal than a slow realization\nOn a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy

are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats has another twenty five to thirty that are our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally out of these has everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is the stuff that is going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh\nAny any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious\nOf of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work\nAnd we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve and the midterms\nIn two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses going\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates\nHim [noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage in anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior\nSo then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters\nWell that would have to be what it is\nBecause the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country and they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a\nCouple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went over like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in ... dad\nContinued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\n\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ...\nThat [noise] it's all negative\nSo I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed\nAgain I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on ballots\nShannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think this is coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve ... who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single poll out for the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C live and die by

from coast to coast we're going to Dover\nNew Hampshire and this is George welcome it's great to have you with us George how're you doing\nGreat thanks for taking my call\nUm I was calling I just wanted to make a show that you actually um that you did years and years ago that I thought was was just great or probably one that shows that you ever hacked\nAnd we're really simple and you basically had to roll call and people just called in with their you know start a business is you know if the small businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know and where they are in\nGeneral yeah yeah you don't you don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties smokes and white collar employees were being laid off\nExecutives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executives it's finally white collar people and not blue collar people [laughter] and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love my finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumps or angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean it was like my second year in business so I remember I remember it well because there was working in January one or ... or at least one maybe with another a rip off from that other\nThree day thing but ah right I just I just think it would be a good a good thing to try you know I mean just maybe on a friday instead of doing you know\nRepublican good Democrat bad stuff I mean which people ... people wouldn't buy 'em\nWell don't don't were downplayed a Republican or Democrat bad thing because there's still\nA whole slew of people that don't get how bad the Democrats are but let me ask you something to do you think that people need to hear business people calling in\nDescribing how great the economy is before they'll believe it is that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run and operate their own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do because you know like most people I ... I work a lot of hours and I'm and I'm grateful for what I make and what I can provide for my family but\nUm it's just it's a good inspiration for the people who do it and we're the people that make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone well\nOkay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and\nWhy they they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts would maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism for anyone\nAnd not take it personally\nSo don't ever fear folks telling me how you think I ought to do this because everybody else does too here is George making this is Lloyd in in in\n... mosque in Wisconsin It's your turn Hi\nHow're you doing their young man why not just fine thank you [laughter]\nAnyway and I was listening to a guy named Donald Trump he was in Iowa discussing how he has done over three billion dollars on the wall so they have been breaking the law you had a caller earlier that did not know that\nWell yeah but there's not a Britain has been laying stopping anybody crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done\nMaybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen and he's done too much into a little time\nNo I don't either get\nEither leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this\nCaravan is uh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions that we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not and we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "El Paso", "day": "19"}
