under arrest and plantation Florida man is being interrogated by federal officials NBC's Pete Williams has the latest\nTo a law enforcement officials have told us that uh a person has been taken into custody for questioning this doesn't mean that anyone has been arrested and charged with these bombings this investigation is moving very fast lots of leads being checked\n[noise] um [noise]\nI also have something sent to me here said that he was um I'm from Avon chore and a member of the Green Party but what I don't see anything on here that says he is all there it is about political party Green Party birthday march seventeenth Nineteen sixty\nTwo ah income information pending what does this site can't tell what this site is it it's um [noise]\nAnyway identifies it as a member of the Green Party a yeah he's got pictures of Trump and he's got GOP stickers all over the uh the window so law enforcement has a press conference slated for two thirty this afternoon they don't know if any more\nPipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nThe New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper ruby recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is\nTelling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated maker\nAnd they were judged to be so unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them a blow\n'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to them is still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist and everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they like trust or what have you so there's going to be a daily use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up\nTending to believe the first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concerned that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy identifying\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption\nThat the bomber was an angry Trump supporter set up at the people Trump is about this is this is the uh the narrative if you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same\nThing is happening today with the economic news we ever GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected\nAnd so the drive by reporting\nThat economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth is it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath\nSpecifically\nGoogle also on his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every day stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still chugging right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate bombs stuff is slowing Republican\nMomentum going into the midterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I've thought a left wing media narrative that had been created but apparently Trump has signed onto what\nPresident Trump today complained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the the scare has distracted from news about the midterms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go\nOut and vote that's his tweet\n\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it and if there isn't any\nKnows about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped\nOr it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling in ... I've got a pool here today\nFrom strategic good strategic strategic\n\nIn the poll Ron ... than the U.S has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these I'm sad reality is that the daily reporting the news\nDoes affect what people think their their perceptions of ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is a is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I say it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while somewhat nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for them in terms\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper with Trump's tweet well somewhat nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to to to to cover up any news or anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans are Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um you know make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this and it will just have to let time unfold on this is a little frustrating trying to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learn things that I can personally confirming\nVouch for and what have no trouble explaining if somebody question about that I'll pass it on to you

I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national rights groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in them and the interesting thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say the election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years\nHulu has your Halloween fix with titles like the nightmare before Christmas\nThat was an eighth vi the horror comedies zombies of mass destruction Wes Craven present they\nTexas Chainsaw massacres too scary movie Christopher Walken in the prophecy the early Jim Carrey flick once bitten poor play with Jackie the good guys all in the original child play plus many more on Hulu and that's new streaming edition and I heart radio [noise]\n\n\nBreeding fucking back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal\nTo Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us hot\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if I can remember that very much for me to have you here too so what's shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted to\nAdd and I loved that pedigree look at where you come from you come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree ethic that's what a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm sure he's listening\nToday oh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell me how sweet that is\nYou know what you bring that up I have to tell you we we we are ...

south at his rallies [noise] but stoking making clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years and looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is a reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy that have a political discussion you can have political discourse\nBut when you've crossed the line it is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs and\nYou know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W.

that which is reported so far today\nAnd you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party [noise] see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what has been done in these\nPast two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanning spies and the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was Bob but somehow that election was illegitimate that project\nStill ongoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began George Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has lost\nAnd in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall\nPapadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign and you never met Trump he never gave him any advice\nBut he was hired early on because the media was happening Trump or your advisors zombies he fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor of from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador to step in the opposite of you know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails so this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told him well they planted in his head\nHe didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true so Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigations go get the ... orange what's all bogus\nThat was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep\nState wants their government back we don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother but this whole two years silent ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool\nThe cover up well continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had to win and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion with on well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it\nI build those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "26"}
