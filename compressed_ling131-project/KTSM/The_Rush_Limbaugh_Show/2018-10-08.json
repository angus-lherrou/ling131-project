Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes\nAnd forcing them out because they're white racists white supremacist totally totally justified so there's a part\nOf me that knows the Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think\nThat this deranged psychological upset\nIs tied to them well let me put it this way\nIf if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me to death it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of Iran's lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be ... to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this when you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms and by the you know what people are now saying Mr certainly\nThe ... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the mid [laughter]\nI Wonder where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea of what\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the war on them in during the election\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or\nBoth sides of this and that's I'm a Democrat side it's not going to fade away and I think everybody needs to know this on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two thousand sixteen\n[noise] they have been mad in saying crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen and this Kavanaugh situation comes up\nAnd I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\n\nI mean there are still talking about investigating Kevin offered her philosophy wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a full\nFledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking you're talking about Gerald ... of a house Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house and they're going to impeach cabinet they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the court\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in\nWhat you and I wouldn't call this massive civil disobedience although it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even try like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether they're paid or not ... I don't I don't want to fall back on that suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate if legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a democratic voters is less than what we think it is\n\nJust because some people have announced that they accept the money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been a real sense election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't they going to land so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences they censor themselves losing control\nAnd losing and losing and they can't deal with it\nThey simply cannot deal with it rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning enterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask\nOver and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\nAnd when these are mad insane the gusting Democrat protesters they are identified with the Democratic party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I can be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but\nFor those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party in representative of\nThe ah the party\nHave large here's J Christian Adams writing it PJ Media Kavanaugh photos fills Senate gallery was sounds will be insane\nSo but it was any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive rooted borderline nuts my experience

were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves and their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is\nIn the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large it doesn't seem to worry at all this kind\nOf

much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this is it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and reacted them they continue

had us on by the heard before but this is\nAn appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger and the host of this CSPAN after one show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if the devastating to me that if a white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white linen before we take they started seriously or or it I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and their power their products no power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question at every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet shop and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men they have sons they have brothers\nAnd anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were often don't Matt ... lake guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable in fact\n[noise] let's see there's actually a story with that exact point made the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because he has\nMale genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely they would have happened\nAnd I mean the Democrats there and insurgency they become a political uncertainty and as you noted thirty he's already feed it they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educates argued that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp through cannot has puts them on the on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank\nRight since you have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just the we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros under these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get an halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who is able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this month just common for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kind of frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election Democrats think the whole country is because if they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied no I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event hadn't happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox saying a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually hurt a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened\nYeah I just have to chuckle
