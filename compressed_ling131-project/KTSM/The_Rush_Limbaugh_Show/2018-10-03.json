B.

[noise]\nYou can read like how many [noise] [noise] I plan running down about ... about their privacy by ...\nAnd ... that that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence that fits vulnerability\n... is its fragility almost in a way or maybe even somebody nervous in traumatized\nAnd scared and that is exactly the a personality that I think she wanted the FX and she succeeded with it and it's because\nOf that but I think I don't no matter what his learned about her and how much she has lived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has\nIf necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had nobody else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno a story here story there I've been noticing things\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel literal asked her about subject a and her answer it and to read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it it's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in\nThat she knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph you don't really know why she asked\nHim this\nWhy why do you what this is not what this is about Canada why are you asking her details to confirm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\n\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up FBI\nForeign has a best friend in the FBI who read ... resigned retired in two thousand sixteen a wonder how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and mano McLean no matter what kind of a possible connections here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as is the letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use it she turns about six hundred bucks on it\nA\nFord was asked directly him a hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel metro have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to\nTake a polygraph test never remember when that question was asked I Do see what the hell was this\nNow Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by ... and others Grassley is on fire by the way Grassley is doing such a bang up job\nAs is his staff here\nA grass we send a letter to Ford's attorneys telling them about the ex boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test\nAnd has again asked\nFor the therapist notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took and Ford's lawyer's have returned that reviews attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to steal the FBI investigation I think they think the case is collapsing and you know what I think\nEvidence of the case collapsing is this New York times story on Trump's taxes\nThat's the first thing I thought when I saw that's New York times story because they've been sitting on this so long that Showtime hasn't been able to prepare a TV documentary on it\nSo Showtime which is owned by CBS\nHas been working with the New York times on this documentary on the supposedly explosive details Trump's taxes and what do we know about Trump's taxes\n\nIt's a blockbuster story of the day the times reports\nThereafter would be considered an official US holiday of Thanksgiving this week in Nineteen fifty seven the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age with its launch of button they cut the world's first artificial satellite\nThe spacecraft those names Nick after the Russian word for satellite the U.

I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHad to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very credible well now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is pulling out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't smart especially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhat an odd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing\nCommittee hearing her allegations would be challenged in test that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they could\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that\nBy this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step and it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumped for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story\nGuess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what\nI often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it\nWas the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia ah ten for bad yet they wanting Trump's tax returns because their tax returns\nThey said would prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nWas make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about Trump but he got rich from his dad\nA bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience just don't remember the Clinton\nYears in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all John's\nHey you never know what you got to do when you gotta do to try to walk with what you're going to come up with what you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire where the ... not a Bill Clinton\nAnd that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester with confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been around to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there Senate didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second are you OK as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIt would destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wages I can answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy push back but it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know no would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protests I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protesters no there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media wouldn't want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me longer than I Want to admit to figure this\nYou cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happened\nThat somebody has to have much to us to say rush probably by being met word\nTo use

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a all Trump is still is reminding everybody\nWhat she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious\nPlaces you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the\nDifferences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is is it is not mocking\nChristine balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush makers last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nOut of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility even later\nTo be critical and the step away he said yeah I found her credible I've founder compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\n\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at at\nThe moon to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique\nIs a trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\n[noise] but I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has established\nThat after he makes that initial statement on something that he can make fun of things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you\nHow if you ever teach them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made the with rage other Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen\nTrump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night\nI Know Murkowski and Collins or shuttering towering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her\nThe actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\n\nHe just said we probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why is that not relevant\nWhy does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell\nRoche women women or nor do we do well\nYeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and it been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life you could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people as one of the many

the from my National Review your ... or join the more time I didn't ... that I never can\nChunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the\nRare moments I was unable to this is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something could be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this um [noise] it well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThat capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate I said\nIt ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening\nHere and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMeant that has been\nConstructed to push all of these disparate various uh gems\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise to these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging the angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was on flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts\nAnd it was all about do you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd me in the way they bowed minutes or do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr Ford testimony and this and it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be followed by the whole the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old average I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back\nYeah it's great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine Kennan this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class that all sex is rape even the sex of marriage and the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's\nBeen taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe that men have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her\nRaping her that's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine it hooked on it if not better right by the way here's an it does you're also random it's not all\nWomen but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not\nYou think this way or being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just that assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get it

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine lousy for this whole thing not her specific maybe I'd look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else get or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant tape\nAnd this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's just many screwed it Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentlemen I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap being ... reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate not a blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll taken after the Democrats\nBegan smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent to hike camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators when women out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nLook at words these free\nHeitkamp Donnelly market what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and the Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed\nIn fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\n\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump's sand last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with your wife found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented\nThe power and wind reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with especially in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence based on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and\nIt is the dates to varying dates the different dates of the sword did event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second\nHis question why the sudden change within a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign\nChanged her story two more times in two months she grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt the charge here and try not try to serve a difficult to convey but this is a text charge\nThere is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't titled Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapist notes the incident is said to have
