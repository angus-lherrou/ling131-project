I think one of the most effective ways of getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kind of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of elections um the the the drive by us have their formula and\nIt's rooted in the desire they habit everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result polling data and says the media so headstrong they want everybody else to\nTherefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a white realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patriots hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have in ...\nAge in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished gravely\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's the allies we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is high and yet they shot hostile sounds hobby on some of the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in daily within within this country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that\nWestern alliance now I like NATO then is fine\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds to me it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but\nBut that's that's what they want to so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich\nSay what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on ... says he's going to do something he's going to\nThat was systems so bulletproof well he can create demand and sell your home at a deadline that you agree to or he will buy it himself\nA real estate doesn't have to be

Vanity Fair is six foot one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is that just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nYou know General Mattis said tails the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances instead prevent World War three\nNo it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time okay I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in time from now but I don't want to be taken advantage\nWhen general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less ... trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we got on the roster coming up probably do\nBut he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf it I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I mean he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell them but my opinions with the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I'm being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker\nAnd immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised by this\nHonest that's the word he uses instead of biased and I can tell you that that's true now what else have you learned that he didn't know but thought he knew\nOr he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats

yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever going to change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to them so much more money than yours is not fair to not paying your fair share and their fair share in taxes and we're going to ... bottom somebody just go yeah

went on for about ... launched that zero tolerance policy [noise]\nDeter families with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when you don't do separate when you allow the parents\nTo stay together okay when you allow that\nThen what happens is people are going to pour into all kinds how are you gonna go back to that cat on his glasses Leslie for

Leslie\nI've done such a great job in the economy everybody wants to come here I'll take the blame for it\nNow she says she misspoke there this law\nOn the ... Obama certainly didn't for separation of just didn't get reported because Obama was cool and couldn't do anything wrong and if it was happening when Obama dead at dinner had to be good reasons for it\nRemember we've got a two tier system of justice in this country and we have a two tier system of media\n\nWell see if it was on the books but he didn't force than what\nYou mean it was on the books that Obama didn't enforce the law but champions enforce it but Trump didn't make the law\nThe Democrats Leslie stall included attempted to make people think that Donald Trump purposely wrote a law or just enacted one that's separate they don't run from their family the ... and you wouldn't believe the number of brain dead people actually believe this happened I\nWas watching an episode of law and order in your S.

and he was saving them\nAnd he was just running child sex rings with them but they tried to make this guy out to be somewhat\nOf a hero because the whole point of the episode was to bash Trump for

with the quest for asylum and the fact that\nWhere the parents are taken while their cases are decided is not suitable for kids the kids were put in much better surroundings and Sanders while their

you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog

whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that let\nGlad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so you're more than welcome to find a good host I remember that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism march said that everyone is either under pressure or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nIt spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nOkay that's it intersection out it'll be for me great honor to wash your you're talking you're you're speaking in language\nOf uh people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful a skater intersection out I mean it's basically something that has been constructed by these marks as\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm a cohabitation with that with militant I'm a Islamic lists that\nThen with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable the says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops out some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I can I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship and African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times\nMore a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just admitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black uh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to blacks than okay All right\nI just want to best because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent then some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert\nA which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of this arid desert as well now I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that not withstanding\nThe accuracy of it not
