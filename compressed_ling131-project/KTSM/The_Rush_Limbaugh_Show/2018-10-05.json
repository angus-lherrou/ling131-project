their lives are so much easier and more informed than just like you and I\nHave formed with El Paso news radio the night\nSam [noise]\nThe course of the many recent months I have made the point that one of the objectives\nOf the modern American leftist to transform America away from its intentions and its designs is founded and in many ways this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration although to do it in a stealth white Obama couldn't come out and\nSay beyond that his policies were transformative uh it couldn't define what that meant\nThere would've been a revolt that he wouldn't have been elected to have you been honest about what transferring America meant so why did he claimed that man was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this transform America but what they really want to do with transfer America away from\nOur unique founding\nConverted to a socialist democracy some of the radicals even want to go further and and and have this country become totally communist\nBack look and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller Jay Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking\nA [noise] you know you'd like\nTo not believe this by the facts on the ground as to what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify a some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that\nBe 'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt to our race self reliant people self reliant people people do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo socialist in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism\nWhich has had as one of its target to the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to pal around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons it tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as\nFamous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant at\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just\nCapitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting\nThe concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic that the emphasis of government the getting government out of people's lives just the exact opposite with communism socialist so I have an evidence base here\nNot just slapping my gums there's a New Yorker story by Michael lift up a guy\nPublished yesterday the cheers of Brett Kavanaugh is its title [noise]\nIt is a horrible peace and it does exactly that which I had been warning people it goes all the way back to the founding\nOf America the trash white man oh that reminds me hang on here you need a grab an audio soundbite here it's a bit of that but I Do but it will be every bit of six and seven [noise]\n[noise]\n... quote Kavanaugh has no avenue of appeal though except his own hurt feelings he's in touch with them as he was taught to be and so he seemingly weaponized crying the way a little boy does when he's in trouble\n[noise] another poll quote But Kevin last performance last Thursday was something entirely different distinctly contemporary if combined the post war attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings to the point that they make crime with the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege\nBecause Kevin ... is accused of sexual assault and may be denied the career elevation he has long\n... why did he blah burned like a newborn he has plot to end his career you'll see\nHe hasn't had a series of

gays lesbians transgendered don't you know this has been a lifelong ... strategy of Brett Kavanaugh and when there was\nIs the timing that she's going to do this after this program and I mean it means rush it can't be anything you're going to like I'm getting emails that say you think that's right too certainly has absolutely thinks that's\nRight as well well we'll we'll see I'm not I'm not going to withdraw my uh acknowledgement that I think she did the right thing [noise]\nBut I'm going to get to the phones because I've um I've gone to many first hours this week without getting to the phones that changes today especially being open line friday so we'll go to Pleasanton, California first with Chris hello\nNow however that rush a good to talk with you I'm this Monica McClain who you were just speaking of the person that contacted 'em as Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah\nUh she she used the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how are those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle it polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way to boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the testimony she goes she mentioned ... Delaware was where she was that and that's the last known address of of this Monica McLean\nCorrect yes ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when ... Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was in ... ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet\nI I'm Wondering if not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\n\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point you know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the leeman Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley referenced it and Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of bossy foreign witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's going to change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence\nAnd if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate about\n\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle\n... well the question is why wouldn't Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWind up getting rid of effort to uh\nUh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it in the ... the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered that led\nTo my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nNo no they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense you're sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the ball Z foreign side is willing to commit\nPerjury ... born perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories\nWhich then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor the exact reason the stories are being suppressed but the ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know you you know what Trump allude in any way to women's time of the month and all hell is going to break\nLoose but here misery even get to talk about it as Lawrence common and every day and everybody gets everybody understands it\nAnd everybody knows what it means it means to stay away leave it alone don't engage yes ma'am yes ma'am three bucks or whatever and go on\nThis\nBy alleging that Republican male senators are acting like the ... metro does Senator Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee he\nHas um I've never seen him this animated I've never seen a turtle is adamant this week the turtle and Grassley has been fit to be tied Grassley still Grassley sent a letter late last night Grassley said his letter at four AM today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he started to Schumer you might have sent it to Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by E N Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely wouldn't produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly reviews ... produced this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial Dr Ford's allegations I don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence\nBut the the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein than the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nHer warriors did and that that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to the doctor for delegations she passed away right attacked or we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have claimed some reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not a lie detector\nThat she passed the lie detector that she told all these details tour therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't produce and Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over\nTo therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein and Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my ... and fried W Ramirez Julie sweating the representative what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with his witness\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes them how how much time spent with this witness discussing her testimony or\nCoaching hard whatever\nI mean he's loaded for bear that's just the kind of college and all the violation and I\nShouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphones and been to the Senate or are they the\nMedia people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen the electorate is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member things are coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to confirm judge Kevin on the floor that\nWas during his southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right\nThe leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like\nThis fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I\nGot an email last night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and\nTalk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from

for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known results something needs to happen\nBesides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is

what Lisa Murkowski voted for today Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nVoted to legitimize and sign off on the most this pick a boat\nFix ever in the Supreme Court nomination Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted in today just stand\nWith Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or doing\n[noise] another interesting thing had another do develop it here but hang on to a second here's a second tweet from Kimberly Russell\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially leave the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two ... devastating tweets and they are right on the money\n\nLegitimizing and signing off on the most is that ... tactics ever standing with Feinstein\nCory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nAnd men dasa they and and a number of other things just\nJust [noise] not much redeeming there but\nMore importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed court stays up for for a deadlock what the ... the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four and then the case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\n\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nWouldn't be the highest ranking court that could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of leftist in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison with me too movement [noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski I don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked ... wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nGo ahead Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture on standby 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally wasn't Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself ... would that hand up she got a cornered she's got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching on the dental camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on his that'll came to be able to see these that's\nThat close up as the same shot just to close up of the previous slave televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been a really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back or one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic under load I certainly what's\nThe old saw it's not for us to criticize who loves who and why

beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] that's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this\nIs kind of interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nRead this and he is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh ... he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat and doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this was in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection\nOf public sentiment for Kavanaugh in this state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to losing ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is ... co workers seat And Corker by the white has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these ... pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anybody we're\nGoing to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperament temperament and they were going to deny because they committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin shouldn't be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argument why don't want to know where are we going to be
