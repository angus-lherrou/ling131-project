figured it was just you know a graphic Colorado graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear telling lies\nOr have ... of election\nThis caravan thing you know I [noise] I continue to study this and try to pick it apart analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it in fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired\nTotal miss characterizations these are desperately poor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic in his all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for it it's all focus grouped\nIt's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up with seven thousand\nPeople that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's\nPhysically not possible so when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven\nBut it is all orchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of leftist just have to stop and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win a massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it isn't it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think\nOrganically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump feared Trump hatred promoting it [laughter] and exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now let me share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the mid term because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning\nControl of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical\nTo five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent or Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day through out the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes

data is from NBC\nSuggest robust in a fool's Yaz among early eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave Republicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting\nSo for example the entire early voting picture in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nThat that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states it is that early voting almost always favors

in terms of purposely lying\nTo deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual

free\nThat it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was\nLying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those lives again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line that the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the

was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protect\nHimself and Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the law is Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting of the two\nI was in hadn't been germs\nAnd Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell where did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember who's\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like he's gone to like you got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far been need them you can't see you you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where there's greater communist ... but rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances have his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nSort of picture up

whip people up at a rally\nAfter rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this was at the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job is covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people will give you a hard time you have people yelling at me at Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where

one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the\nEmails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises a guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think

El Paso his use radio six Ninety and I heart radio station pay GSM am El Paso these views radio six Ninety [noise]\nSee news radio I'm John Jeffries President Trump is pointing the finger at Democrats for the caravan of migrants from Central America making their way towards the U.S Mexico border\nThe president was campaigning for Republican Senator Ted Cruz at a rally in Houston when he said he believes the Democrats have something to do with the Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing their countries\nTo know what's good for you which is how the left looks at the body politic in general it is how the left it's how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well\nYou know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various to tax\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past I'm kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise\nTo do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are electing properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink not worth your support they've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nJim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside\nJust roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week or longer and he can't stand it\nAfter all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some conventions setting\nIn New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to have it anymore\nBut what is troubling as to look behind it and see the reaction of people to why he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly\nYeah oh it's just it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump is see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is he does it I think because it's still\nWorks at sea so Trump traumas he's pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots and Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending golly like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump urged hey resent the hell out of Trump could come knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid\nNow you are which takes me to one piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science ... Williams cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides of mind\nAnd his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from is paid every bill in us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating in for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased princes five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten and\nThis is so right on the money they're not have to resort to the shore rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared\nLess this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has none left how's this or\nGo larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\n\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist either no right to alert or at Yale\nThey do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work they hate\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't have any ... except getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him\nNot be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life is short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself invents and uses\nI'll tell you folks and this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he is certainty that America is decent than exceptional\nThey hate certainty that's what I have found over the years that people that have have\nSerious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so\nCertain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many\nPeople are just not right and everybody has the ... way too you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it fine no you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you wouldn't be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that\nThey love equip vacation I Love people see the post sign to things they he reaching out with\nThe heart they hate certain movie especially when it conflicts with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him for because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever he never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy likes women doesn't see the need to apologize for it\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in Ryder ashamed of him as they are at JFK and Bill Clinton but\nGartner says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most of ... constrained the average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad in other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it\n[noise] the difference between citizens who hey Mr Trump and those who can live with him whether\nLove are merely tolerating comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer the factory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife left\nAnd market homes and I can tell you in my experience in El Paso the agent that we have really come to trust\nIs Brian birds of century Twenty one haggard he\nNow besides

only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's\nSuch a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of John ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster but there's you know thousands of people on the line well and they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go back\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR's at great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can\n[noise] that the airport we got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here about\nThe only time I've interested in NPR is when they run pieces to translate\nWhat I've said oh for the audience and and that happens while I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day as I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human being I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know an S. obey screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi there's there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose\nIt has as its purpose to\nFlood into the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful a Democrat causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\nWay most or ... or whatever it is it what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to run into you know on the street\nI mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are\n... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach and he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats book\nAsked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before the caravan most congressional Democrats on immigration as a loser for them a\nMemo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on that immigration was vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Coney end up Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which he has doubled down on\nBy the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan and being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups to tour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nNow they're worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense it makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do the smoke they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself\nAnd and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so\nPoisoned with hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put yourself\nIn their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done his work in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't\nPersuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're\nJust ... to be tied\nOver it they're at

percent of those polled are undecided vice president Mike Pence is promoting President Trump's plan for a U.S base force\nA [noise] wish I could think of the actual name of the legislation but the impact of it is is that we have to show\nMore consideration to people who come from Central America than from Mexico in our asylum and entry policy it was originally intended to dissuade people from Mexico\nFrom Washington and Lee attempting to immigrate across the border but it's had the exact opposite effect it has forced people that want to come into the United states to first go down to Guatemala El Salvador\nOr Honduras and start the track from there because\nCurrent US law makes it easier to get into the country if you're trek starts south of Michael\n[noise] and that's a lot of what's going on here\nBut if you in any way permit this mob to enter the country after the track you may as well just send out engraved invitations to anybody else around the world and say come on it\nJust can't do that and I have no doubt that whoever is behind this is attempting to pressure\nControl a American political systems and it's it's designed to\nMake people I think put up their hands like some are starting to we can't stop in Russia and can't stop it we just got a lot of men we can't stop it\nI I think it's ... it's almost a variation of of course our proven or pivot and he's just

demanding and claiming benefits to the point they cannot be paid there isn't the money I have the whole system collapse\nAnd then the left will be there to rebuild it in their image based on the disappointment an anger of the people who were left out\nAnd that is a strategic plan it's right alongside the ... lights for literally destroying the United states by overwhelming the social safety net apparatus and that's\nUp I think another microcosm of what this mob is\nIt's a visual aid that shows America being overrun it illustrates America is\nBy itself in wealth and prosperity and that we owe it to the rest of the world to share and it's not fair we have so much and they have so little and they live so relatively close\nDon't doubt the politics of this\nFor eight minutes and they are

not even one percent here\nAnd yet has become a this group of people has become a major major support group of the American the left and the American media for what purpose\nDefining janitors says the New York times as a condition determines strictly by a person's genitalia is based on a notion that doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody is male or female determined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable\nAnd needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of scientists Democratic Party science consensus of scientists and climate change\nResearchers\nWho studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed\nSaid that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge quote\nDr Josh it was safer and in droves endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia\nBut we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not male ... not necessarily the same time when you have a baby that has female\nGenital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says\nSo then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a person's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again as the doctor from Mount Sinai in\nNew York we know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity well we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired it is biological is not entirely hormonal and we don't have\nIdentified dean so we cannot specifically say that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender\nShe has a in studies of twins if one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the this is NBC News US President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux and that he aims to protect the country after a report that his administration was
