matter where you go every story drudge for example links links to on his page is a story\nOf the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly I think the same thing is going to happen\nCertainly you you're taught to swamp dwellers you I mean you do hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin toast in the house of representatives\nWell [noise] [noise] what I Know what what what what [noise]\n[noise] well yeah I'd like to get an individual pose a visual nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens with all that that's getting into the in the new show I'm I'm just talking about over all the national\nAttitude um and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm only ... people to think that everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of countries\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked at issues of everybody looked at American the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that\nWith reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the\nWay we do for a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium\nTour\nBill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all this Trump action\nNow I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\n\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats and the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... willing that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do what ever but certainly not in two thousand\nShe couldn't she couldn't she\nCouldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking for those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy and and we and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have a Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got\nTo try if they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it\nA prayer until the Clintons\nThe daily wire has the story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that they are embarking on a nationwide stadium tour\nTaking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities the small it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show it will feature\nThe Clintons sharing stories and inspiring anecdotes that shape their

open your radio six Ninety Sam [noise] sorry last caller Sean\nFrom Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline from political [noise] just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP\nHouse is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe\nThat okay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine feet\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSalt\nTo resign seats familiar leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nThis this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington living die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an out some sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine feet firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me\nWhat it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters [noise] so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat\nSo that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide ...\nWith the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question as Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nHas a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since Electra night two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically

it\nAll started Lee said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching you know you know this this

I literally\nI remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was um [noise] Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never

demeaning kind of car to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in a cab that John Tower\nTried to sexually assault you in the back of the tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all\nThis came out but\nSally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he\nDrag now where did this nightclub and ordered
