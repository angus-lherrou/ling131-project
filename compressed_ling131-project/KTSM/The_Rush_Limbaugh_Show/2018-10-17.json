midterm elections as he faces intensify as the pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\n\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents everything has\nBlown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus on us in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blew up on 'em every attempt in October surprise\nThis year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all along the mother is going to get the good on how\nTrump's Foley election by keeping including what the Russians and when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration\nNot so much with all the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the games you but they're they're looking to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been they've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished\nAfter the terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this folks\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak yet if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather than break the rules\nAnd released a report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don moment is wrapped up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment are going to be talking about before\nThe midterms in hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is imminent that\nIs what they're hoping they were hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on the educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is\nThey will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWhen mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically is bars at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude the investor you particularly\nFor for ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against the seven anyway he um I became\nA a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself he put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can't understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference they ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shock geo right\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey really don't care about social issues they care about taking this

what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a nationalist press and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't range but your real frustration of the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people going to go out and vote and they have no idea here at newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reason\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up or might never seen anything my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with the lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus\nThey used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a

nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country\nIt is a modern era of generic piece in other words the storylines or all fictional all made up and it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them a small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more than\n... trash and it's the one that wins is the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the ... got six breaking the rules there has to be something air mistreating people they\nSexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists the U.S a call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to us and people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism\nIs I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a a a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it\nRemains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I

has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this just sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not pretending

where is this fall and we'll probably know that by the end of the way my Clampitt was coming back we're gonna have a long talk\nDonald Trump simply took it upon himself to inform the American people what the drive by maybe were hiding\nThat she didn't know anything about the event she couldn't tell anybody where it happened when it happened she couldn't describe the house where it was she wasn't even sure of the year much less of the month she\nIdentified for people over there all four said they were not there she did not have any answer for how she got home what she said that a person she first met after this happened none of it all Trump did was remind everybody of this or actually inform them because the drive buys have not\nAnd that then cause the meat eater run the story of Donald Trump saying this because they hadn't been hiding it\nThey hit it because it was not helpful to their ... their cause which was getting rid of Cavanaugh\n\nI mean it's a central part of the story that the person making the charge doesn't have any evidence places people there who deny that were there and can't remember anything about the event other than she had one beer the media not reporting that Trump does the media falls for the trap and reports over\nAnd over Trump saying it while accusing him of mocking her mocking is not what he did\nTo mock or he would have had to attempt to impersonate her and he did not try to impersonate or he simply reminded everybody and real world language that she had no\nBut it's and it was the turning point in the outcome of those hearings make no mistake once Trump\nDid that and cause the meeting at the end up reporting what they had been ignoring\nThan\nA lot of support that was their instinctively fur balls the Ford man is jihad no evidence there was nothing to support\n\nPeople with common sense there was nothing to do you believe her yeah the basis of what well it does have one but she doesn't know when she doesn't know where the poor people she said there were there to say they weren't\n... she became impossible to support and defend other than by partisans and that was the turning point in Kavanaugh came in and of course his his re testimony has re appearance was a subtle factor now the whole thing is happening again\nThe story was that the porn stars defamation lawsuit a Trump got thrown out\nIt was a nothing burger\nForum monks that drive by media reported that Stormy Daniels\nAnd the creepy lawyer that she hired ever not we're going to destroy Donald Trump they were going to prove that Trump had violated campaign finance laws to remember all of this\nAnd there was Michael Cohen in the mix and he'd paid are often Michael Cohen's slipped and has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how last he is\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around the drive by his were they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause lab even before balls the Ford did\nAnd then that fell apart\nA judge in Los Angeles threw out the porn stars defamation lawsuit of Trump\nClaiming it was bogus\nIt had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political\nAnd so did the lifespan of her creepy porn lawyer who had already shot himself in a couple of feet by bringing forth some charges it that Kavanaugh had arranged gang rapes in high school and college\nSo all Trump did\nBy calling her horse face was call attention to a news story that the drive by as we're trying to ignore the news story was her lawsuit was drunk Trump was not guilty of whatever she was ... he had\nDone to her in fact she had been found\nGuilty the judge it through the lawsuit out demanded that she pay his legal fees\nI said this makes Trump a big winner again here the prostitute porn star is paying Trump\nWho among us can arrange it that way folks but Donald Trump can\n\nThey also ignoring that part of it\nIgnoring that the strip her porn star andme in order to pay Trump's legal fees\nBut when Trump called her horse space in a tweet all of the media were forced to run the story of his victory so you can sit there and say that Trump\nIs embarrassing goes there which sits at talking about people that way I think it makes it so hard to\nRemember what I told you about the white Trump operates and pacing how he his original tank or opinion on any issue might make you think he's selling out but he gets that first take on the record\nMedia says wow it's been very reasonable you said that Dr Balt the Ford was very credible American phone shantytowns surprising then after the passage of time with Dr balls the Ford clearly has no evidence Trump says you've got no evidence and here's the evidence that she knows no evidence blah blah by\n... gets his news covered\nThe media was not reporting this lawsuit but from the media was not reporting and she had to pay him as legal fees the media was not reporting\nOf being Trump win and remember what was this woman and her lawyer we're trying to ruin\nTrump campaign finance violations and all of that [noise] so

hire a van or tied with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader plus year Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure\nBut the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more Trump's low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to one\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing\nAnd that was after the failed pork you was it was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank another policies highly antagonistic\nTo Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving\nOf Obama the Democrats have been if Trump so who actually is being divisive\nCrumbled a GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no matter what he does I have to think that the drive buys are fully aware of this may not want to admit that Trump's approval numbers really much stronger than it's being reported and is\nA much higher here's that story certainly you
