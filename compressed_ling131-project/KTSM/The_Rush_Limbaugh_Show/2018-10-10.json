you know for a bunch of people that are brimming with confidence don't what if they're going to be running in the world than three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a

you think\nThis guy worked for the lawn vents yeah former senator in Texas I knew Jack Kennedy Kennedy was a friend of mine and you're quite a while you're no Jack Kennedy that lord that's right

win every ... like the hills I\nHad a story yesterday I mean it looked like Jordan nine seats are going to convert to the Democrat Party\nFormer\nFirst lady Michelle Obama warmly most popular respected public figures in America should spend the day taping personal endorsements for democratic candidates\nFor the house and Senate this\nColumn is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis\nColumn is a code red alert to Democrats in a call to arms on the most popular and respect the Democrats in America such as Michelle my bell Obama to lead the charge for hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view Butowsky there was a twenty five percent chance are Democrats and the mid term is what the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done well she's already\nTalking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and then Trump or for life\nSo now there's a twenty\nFive percent chance that Democrats and the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same as a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at five pm on election night\n... ... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for balding maximum\nAction and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sensitive opportunity in danger\n\nSays it's possible that Democrats when the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible of Democrats gain only ... seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading loser is in the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members\nDemocrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing a Republican Senate that there's even further to the right and even

politics of hatred and fear and don't you love [noise]\nYou people on the left don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you do not understand confidence when

checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right to ... warns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent [laughter]\nMy point is again\nDo not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and then there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private not even they\nReally believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be this theory of hand or\nDepressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side\nIs ... up turnout ... up interest and they're really flux and ticked off\nAt a bunch of polling data there is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News poll a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women\nAre saying in polling data that they have veil reading new interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed to happen\nThat's why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand sixteens you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got to dial it back we got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were ... they were definitely of of uh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\n\nI mean they had Trump's chances three percent seven percent ten percent but nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win Trump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in a lecture in the world when he won he didn't want to win and they were all depressed that Trump had quarters that's what they wanted you to believe\n\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is no power is the birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American realizes the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others who are\nRaising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish also\nFrom Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the terms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... attempting to sway American opinion I handled the elections\nOf ... wants a whim [noise]\n\n... want the Democrats to win right why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party that when

Ford for her allegations what message does that send to women\nAnd remember\nWomen went for President Trump in two thousand sixteen Hillary seven white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice that of last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\n\nFor a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in the Democratic party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats realized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections\nWith the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm for up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly crusty on I'm for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the\nCourts if you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nWe have bastard ice pop culture laws that are ... today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then\nPronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them\nThat's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\n\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional guy\nThe ass not by you in fact\nTo Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other\nWe're not going to destroy each other Hillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christianity for listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face that's a Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened\nIn the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of\nThis is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's\nIt's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease\n[noise] who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice\nCannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more on civil\nWhat an irresponsible statements every Democrats should announce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data\nEight hours

yeah I I'm so you think you'll go you listen to this program the podcasts and check the website and you watch the Trump rally and you hear Trump said things that you\nHeard or read on the podcast or at my website is that right\nOh yeah I mean I hear him say things that I Know he you know he's smart that he doesn't come up with himself but so I Know I mean I can see him listening to your podcast like in the morning when he gets gets up at the White House and things like that would be the most efficient way\nI can honestly say that I Do not know if the president listens to the podcast now he's told me he listens to the program and it gets a chance and he is is that but\nYou know who knows but he's told me he does I I I've I've very flattered by by your comment can I ask you a question before we go on I'm sure I'm just I Want people to hear it how do you get the podcast everyday how have your range to receive it\nWell I have you're at and I download your podcast\nRight there right

people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails when this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia's just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just he wants to brag he's just doing this therapy are no\nPlans you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump ... seem to have any real interest in ... he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about\nHim he does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants people to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor as of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him is there's so many smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the lead voice with the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... and ... [laughter] hey my point is ah today a with Hillary's comments that are\nBasically liberals don't they serve it eats anymore it reminded me of a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for Barbara ...\nAnd I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his and bracing barbarism again just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what ... ... were trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism\nAnd half the clocks and the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight now with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you know there was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy one morning then\nThink it was a before the Nineteen forties\nAnd know what ... what not when what why are they what were they like when the Democrats weren't the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nIssue was a labor laws and um when what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in an anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government\nThey've just now a band in any pre chance of moderation about that and have gone all in on militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're not that different there just mass getting less today\nHere at no read about it in the paper [noise] tomorrow Raj Shah Mickey I be network news radio\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and he goes to the doctor a true story goes to the doctor and he's diagnosed with cancer stage four\nAnd here's the thing he had switched earlier for medical insurance to medical care where Christians share each other's medical bills to the question for Jordan and his wife Jenny was is this actually going to work our medical bills\nExceeded a hundred and sixty thousand dollars not to share members shared all our bells\nAnd it was about more than just the money to this is a real community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it without measure\nIt's so worth looking into there's a reason this is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight five five fifty one Bible that's eight five five five one B.

people at Trump rallies they're non violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous\nAnd they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people having a great time these are people that are a beep and happy they are excited to be wherever they are\nThey are part of something that matters greatly to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary democratic protest is striking\nYou contrast the people at this rally last night it was\nIt was a Council Bluffs Iowa you contrast that with with that on for ... picture to me of these kids are going at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon right I think the\nBanging on the

having a good time and there's nothing threatening or intimidating and there's a lot of laughter\nAnd just general happiness and you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event and even if you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrats sponsors of an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outrage and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I want you

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of Iraq\nJust to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings says James yeah so having watched this before I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps establish was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern I\nI'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was run about ... nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found it so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that was Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh up pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from all the Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Avon ... client\nWas her name swept Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left one gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is Krista Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you [laughter] thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts you mentioned that photo that yesterday but with this novel as it is and Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried when the mom and they left and the act in it and then fattening or if things again to help people\nUm it just hadn't have worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything and Chong firing of it comes to creating an armed guard on our cars\nBecause we truly are the silent majority we're not out there showing it I mean I've been to rally but um it just hasn't really scared and worried because you know living my day each day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "El Paso", "day": "10"}
