south China Sea the new Tio has those details\nBut the bond is going to have expenses which means you're not going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter of the year to date the past one or three years\nAnything can happen in that short a period Ohio was suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're gonna hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're expecting targeting\nSome action of seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know Ohio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the same cost that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point\nNow let me take another stuffer\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot of investors think that the key to generate\nSuccessful return is by picking the right investments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell let's look at it this way according to tip around in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred and Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty so of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty four team only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and all of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds on the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nCBS and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one out of thousands so unless you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going\nTo outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it in our firm we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive\nInvestment approaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market or try to provide the returns the market modest fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes and inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight\nIn two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent\nSo if you picked an above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe\nYou lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation of any crime right I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not what you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that end I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class\nAmericans forty percent are facing poverty\nIn retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis and that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return\nIf not buying\nA lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick joining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot in the void and what's not that's not the key\nTo achieving your long term financial goals our goal here for you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving in the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us AAA plan wreck we've been doing this for more than Thirty years we've been doing this for tens of

weekend\nGood morning my name is John I'm I'm listening to the economic right now I'm looking\nYou ate expert Scott yeah those people that don't have enough in their\nFinances to retire and it's like a a sixteen year old she quote expert I sixty four\nI'm lost money during in the market my husband go passed away a had hatched by and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I and against sixty four jak\nEconomic should work into that because the guy where he provided money for their retirement is you know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing\nShould be scared and what life on their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working\nCan be very exhausting I'm ... that are stepping day and um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless comment she has made on this show this morning\nI'm horrified that he is a graying with everything she has to say why don't we get swept where Ninety or totally guy maybe that's the thing to do that with that is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw upset but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault that she's now finding herself and retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get\nProfessional financial advice before throwing all of our life savings in hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives ah I feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voice mail but I got\nAnd this boys you might recall hearing before what's listen\nI'm calling to say that I got on the couch with quite a while and I decided I Would never invest\nAnd him or his company he goes on at no cost him about a simple answer that take three minutes he takes staying ... keeping themselves\nLike he has to al ... is he is no longer a good example of like clear Swiss banking it's boring now that it takes up most of the show was stupid questions that she doesn't stop answering\nHe's a little help I think she too old to keep going on with your show it's become very boring let's talk about the financial crisis this week instead of going on and on about\n... questions come out\nHow to fix the show I don't catch a psychotic it felt like my friend Catholic to feel the same way he checked wander all over the place like a lot so ...\nSo the fascinating thing that voice might be familiar to you because nearly seven years ago in January of twenty twelve she contacted me for the first time and here's what she said back then\n[noise] I'm a college tuition maniac on\nAnd on wham can't wait a second maniac planting you can ask if man and the cat to count\nThem as an individual and\nIt had life depended on it I Am absolutely I aged out of him and his crazy ranting get him somehow and shame on hand by God man\nBut now what was fascinating here is look\nI I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help or she should be recommending psychological help but anyway\nUh it gets to just chose to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the ... show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of how a man on the show why but\nI'll tell you who does have a regret Suzie\nOrman has a regret she says but she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold that just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six\nMillion dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate at unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nThat was the due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nThe interest in principle from the securities because some of the investors want the interest in other investors want the principal a different time periods so they\nTake these treasuries and they strip out the interest giving them to one investor and another investor gets the principal back at maturity and ... they're called strips in so Wall Street invents lots of products like this they invented lions liquid yield option notes\nUh they've got tigers treasury interest grain tore receipts there are page after their income generators but no nobody on Wall street has ever created a bear because you know that's Wall Street doesn't like bears um we like balls but I don't think anybody ever invented a security called a bull\nUm but anyway I digress so let\nMe ask you the question before I described for you whether you should be investing in a strip or investing in a tip a treasury inflation protected security oh tell me what it is you're trying to accomplish\nA I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is that I have quite a few CDs right now which are destroying right or interest\nAnd what I Want to do is take out enough money or I don't go over the limit at up to my Medicare payments\nEvery year mhm with increases\nAnd I know it could go to somewhere around a hundred and eighty thousand dollars in income and I like to do that only by drawing down on my ... between me and the wife\nAnd I don't want to have any additional ... oh I did I had the you know be paying to stay in other words what I read the areas that they take you don't have to report that to the state\nOr hang on hang on hang on I think you might be focusing on the wrong thing here it sounds like you're focusing on trying to avoid additional taxes additional Medicare expenses\nWhat I'm more concerned about is do you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle and will you have sufficient income to sustain your lifestyle over the rest of your combined lifetimes of you and your wife that's much more important issue isn't it\nYes it is so have you done an analysis to determine that\nI had a really done it out there but I think I probably have enough money stashed away that it\nProbably going to be an off whether or not you know depending on how long outlive naturally and how long the wife live\nSo I think it would make sense to do that calculation uh let me just do real quick back of the neck for what's the total amount of money that you and your wife have between savings accounts investment accounts retirement accounts IRAs et cetera add it all up what's it worth\nA probably a couple of ...\nAnd how much money do you and your wife spend on a monthly basis\nOh probably three thousand bucks maybe\nTotal all end all expenses\nAre yet probably about three grand\nThen I Would agree with you based on two million dollars in savings and investments and only spending thirty six grand a year and we haven't even talked about Social Security yeah I Would agree with your urine find economic shape\nWhich means you don't need to be taking a lot of investment risk and therefore I don't think you need to be getting terribly exotic with your investment strategy I mean although it's possible that you might get a higher return from a treasury strip or a a inflation protected bombed a relative to a bank CD I don't know if the difference is all that\nWorthwhile relative to the complexity these securities\nAnd the lack of certainty you have about them and understanding of how they work compared to ordinary bank CDs the difference in the yields is not going to be all that significant and I don't think material enough for you to bother doing something different\n[noise] All right I was wondering if it would have any effect\nDon't think it's going to be material enough that this was based on a thirty second conversation I'm having with you if we delved deeper or I could certainly argue that\nAll of the choices you've mentioned are paying very low rates of interest in today's economy as you know and there are other strategies that are worth considering that can dramatically improve the potential for higher rates of return\nIs it necessary in your case not really not relative to the amount of money you've got an amount of income you need not really necessary is it perhaps desirable well maybe that's up to you uh so I could argue that you should meet with one of my colleagues we have an office in Cherry Hill not far from you\nSo in Mount Laurel where we could go into all of this detail and show you the alternatives that are available to you but that's entirely up to you if you just kept doing what you're doing financially speaking I think you and your wife would be fun\nTo do in Cherry Hill New Jersey right\nYes it is then if you like I'll put you on hold and get your phone number will connect you with our colleagues in a Cherry Hill and go from there\nOkay that'd be fine All right Neal I really appreciate your phone call thank you very much you can do what Neal dead and call triple each plan record it's really important\nThat you put your investment strategy in the proper context why bother adding complexity to your life tax complication dear life getting into securities you're not really familiar with are accustomed to when the material differences in results are really not going to be there when\nIn fact you might need to be addressing a totally different question instead which is am I going to be able to sustain my current lifestyle for as long as I in my spouse may live that the more important fundamental question and you want to make sure you have that answer nailed down first\nThanks so much for your phone call you know I'm really glad to see folks so intently focused on retirement and engaging in planning will you have enough money that's really the key question isn't it I mean if you were Bill Gates I don't think you care very much\nWarren Buffet I don't think he really needs is Social Security check right so for them it's not a big deal for you and me so
