punishment if it turns out that Saudi Arabia is behind the killing of a Washington Post journalist ... made the comment in an interview with CBS is sixty minutes set to air Sunday the president stopped short of blaming the Saudi Government for the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\nThat's assuming that you had a portfolio that consisted of nothing but that\nNow who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings in the stock market\nI wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile asset class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering\nMassive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part of your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been saying\nHow am I I'm a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how calm I don't have all my money and the stock\nMarket because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else of course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really I don't have all of my money in the stock market boy I'm really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given an asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternatives instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know what's been going on with General Electric right we've been talking about G E for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year gee it was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year\nWow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the S. and P. five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date fruit Tuesday\nRanked at\nThe four hundred and Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred that came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than\nGee you're the date but as of Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but certainly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next is you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the G anyone from among the worst two of the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the death style the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred were advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nSoup for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just the suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed\nIf your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not enough itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still humming along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStop watching it doesn't mean you should change your investments that means you should change much at all that's the most effective advice I can give you on the show today I Want you to stay with us because if you're still struggling on what you should be doing with your investments I have the number one piece of advice\nAnd I'm going to tell you what it is when we come back here on the

radio show heading out to Troy, Michigan Paul's on the line how you doing fall\nOn my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum pension ... given the opportunity to take on and a lot of ... and put on it\nUh the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo that's a yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks\nThe good news is this it is\nStraight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis\nVersus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices now I say usually and here's one big case where it's\nUsually not true of great Australian our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions\nThe pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they're giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise but the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul\nNo single okay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse\nOr so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you so not as big a deal another major one is lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you\nWhereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income you can increase that\nAnd coming ever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given the lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know yourself that you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd you would say the best thing to do is put it and I are a\nYes assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order and you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I said usually the answer is yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with a lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to see which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good so\nYeah but then there's there's like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you get that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit down and see the growth uh especially be taking it ten years before I eligible anyways for the fallout so there's a lot of room for growth and that money\nCarrie thanks for your question uh yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this number one\nYes the markets do anticipate\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the markets do anticipate that and they adjust\nSecurities prices based on that in other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market is a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked end\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond\nWill have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nThat makes sense the longer the duration of the longer the maturity date the greater the swing in value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should\nProbably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you hold on a maturity and have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities or for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this is something new and different for investors most folks are ... comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates are pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment and not realizing that rates could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty them bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up we're now in a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question don't buy a bond unless you're planning to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably on bombs in that sons that are shorter immaturity rather than longer\nAnd to know exactly what kind of bombs are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk of the financial advisor and we're happy to help you triple each plan wreck to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIraq is Mick more prone to answer a question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase of prices for a number of the products that we can see where it's purchase\nMy question is where does all that tariff money go does it go straight to the government coffers\nDoes is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah manic uh the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is this\nEssentially attacks it's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers um\nIt's really that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch the other governments throw equal punches and uh and there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government and taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem but the burden is paid by American consumers who a\nFoot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of ever noticed

sciences at Boston College is Carol school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles and the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data a useful in the financial planning world so at least you're I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here like your endorsement\nAlicia is a a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\nIf it's not good right now we calculated in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working households are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades\nUm the landscape has changed a lot in recent decades has gotten a particularly a or sent ... natural prices\nMean to some to those me why what we should ask why what lost\nA lot of money in two thousand eight now a lot of house values and those items haven't totally return\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the Dow is pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it\nAnd yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that's a sharp and the stock market the people who hold stocks or the people in the high income so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have um their stock values have gained in\nTheir ... but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data trick two thousand sixteen and haven't quite gotten back to the\nOf the bubble a by two thousand sixteen but the house values are really high on the coasts as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks than oh seven had they held through today they'd be a lot better off\nThe first fact as you pointed out as most people did known stocks at all second those many of those who did hold stocks and those seven panicked in nine years old at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later\nThey haven't enjoyed the run up in value because they didn't hold onto their investment for having continue to add to their investments\nSo they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and that's a lot of people lost their jobs between a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded they lack the withdraw the money well our marriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that's forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and it has a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves what they want outlive as one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're writing your investments to more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means less money ultimately need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy instead of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you have or saving more your investments can grow more in value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise\nMyself exactly right but lose the only one other asset that's left that a lot of people I think more and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for oh I'm\nJust I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer um you're right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and a tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer
