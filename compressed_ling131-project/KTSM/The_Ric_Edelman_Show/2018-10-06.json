I just wanted to make sure this is this is not a composite decorating it was like no it's okay it's what ... yeah I've had a a few calls but I Can't say that I've had a lot of calls a bit more\nAbout the composite than than I have the pressure treated wood but the whole industry as a whole and I'm sure you've realized this and found that out\nIn your researching it wasn't just one company as the entire\nIndustry when they went from ca treated wood\nTo the AC cute too then other formulations\nThere were issues there were issues with the AC you\nI'm with the um rusting of the\nActual Joyce hangers an actual nails and screws exact and then they went into these other ones and the the different types I mean everybody's using different formulations and they weren't but but I Can't say that it is a massive problem at least that has touched me\nWell I can see from my standpoint it's actually I Can't call it a massive problem it's a ... so aggravating because as I replaced boards it's so hard to you know you see an individual board\nAnd my deck is probably dying ten twenty percent at a time\nYeah well it's a massive problem if it's happening to you well yeah\nBut I my decision has to be whether I keep fiction replace the Borgias they go bad or terrible thing up and spend a huge amount of money to put something else though so anyway I just was concerned if you'd heard that\nI had a few calls and I have heard of it and when I said massive I mean I'm not getting calls every week about it a woman but let's\nIs out there um yeah I get it then I get the whole uh you know do I do I

yours figured is a long time ago\nUh but you know it's all about price in the big box stores and they now some of 'em are just carrying just the ground contact thank you\nBut because she says makes

it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment cost a and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as what you grow up with what you were familiar with\nBut you've accepted that need to adapt\nAnd stay current with the marketplace so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nIf we take a look at data that has just come out from a a recent survey do back ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that ATF just sky rocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three points\nFour trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions in the ATF as well but not everybody's been\nTaking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of each yes themselves they're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they'd lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year 'cause that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were\nAnd almost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history\nWith the stock market tripling and values since the steps of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they earn behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand

money the parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line sixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers say they know little or nothing about financial planning well\nActually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parents ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security well that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad\nAnd they're worried about you first of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem teenagers in fact\nAs we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving a car you might want to pull over as I give you this was a strict one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire or a hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life costs\nThey don't understand how expensive cars are or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad you haven't told them I think\nSo my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your tea\nThe nature stood alongside you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate in games with them when the time you go talking about investments include them in the conversation\nYour kids are worried about this and maybe they don't need to be as worried\nYou know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemic send a oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet\nThe last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate\nThat last taboo in American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions and an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kind of weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a character has to say\nHi Ray cares Custer against from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised with affects that to your show was listening to all sorts of other us\nBut I think you really should that's because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do feller opinion when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification et cetera location dollar cost averaging or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here answer shows that budget is not a very good use of so much time but the wealth take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight years old they're all they're run this two years old the youngest one would go to a private school next year just like the oldest\nSo far as being able to save a little more literal above twenty percent of my income\nBut was it affects their expense if I don't make adjustments or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about tough as much of what I'm saving and I'd like to avoid it with an ...\nOf what you were supposed to have withdrawn but didn't so you've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw\nAnd it's required hence the name are empty required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging and reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life if you want her to do it\nOn a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you'll get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the accounts at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other Iranian her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily so the calculations are complicated\nThe rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they are on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYour blood most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or errors or omissions and uh\nA beautiful advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur so be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals out of your account\nSo that sounds good Rick and and we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my account so good we make sure they're not the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter]\nVery clever so chat I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball there I Wish everybody else was too so thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day

the way you want to hear another way that people make mistakes\nThey know they have to withdraw their money by age seven eight and a half so they withdraw the money in the year that they've turned Seventy but they haven't yet reached age Seventy and a half guess what\nRift draw doesn't count so you can I talk about the complexity of the rules quite frankly it's a whole thing's a a set up the rules are so complicated they're designed to trick you and trap you\nEnabling the IRS to nail you with penalties these rules could be made so much simpler so much easier so much more fair that would eliminate the need for the complexity which does no useful purpose for anyone other than to frankly provide job security for accountants\n... now's the time to take advantage of our free

anesthesia are recognizing that we can combat germs um\nIn fact Listerine is named after Joseph Lister anyway I Want to read you this very short to paragraph excerpt from the book to give you a contrast of medicine in the Eighteen hundreds compared to today quote\nThe injuries and afflictions that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself thousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living in filth doodle\nThe shortage of housing brought on by such rapid urbanization but their jobs were both physically demanding and hazardous\nA

fifty\nSharing cross hospital treated sixty six thousand emergencies including sixteen thousand falls from scaffolds or buildings Thirteen hundred accidents involving steam engines milk hogs or cranes

and\nCautious use the spokes knives and other domestic implements unquote these accidents often involved children\nWow compared that\nTo life in the workplace today and let me share with you another

many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but you didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a one way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or\nIs it is true and it isn't very advantageous in the meantime uh after full retirement age at least your benefits go eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get ... percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government failed that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough what seems to be a concern of many people\nTo receive is much accrued benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two uh if you do wait until toward Seventy or at eight Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great uh a lot of folks really don't the one thing I
