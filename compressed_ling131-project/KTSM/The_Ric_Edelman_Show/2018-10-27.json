spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know and that's\nReally scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike bank safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know a secret boys my house no antibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state\nAttorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not willfully\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice to you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million ... taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends in charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone you're going to be a pariah\nSo if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them so in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to

how much given your mom\nHow much is given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars\nYou know my friend knock them you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent which means if you\nGive away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it\nYou're now down to three fifty we haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery requires\nA massive change and lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them\nAin't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invest it into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for

send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nIraq this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stop investment since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation rate so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I Am not only pay one or two or three percent but so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and they'll strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago but the money into those call today\nBut think about this when you die who gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue that that money really isn't yours it's bears and you are merely the steward\nOf that money you're the custodian your the caretaker of that money\nIf you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use\nThat for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind meaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars\nThey invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms therefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age\nBut based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George

about\nHow to invest you know three thousand dollars from a summer job into a rough IRA in forty years later it's worth a you know big number it was all exciting told me dad I'm going to be a millionaire someday so\nI'd like to continue um you know that thirst for knowledge but didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read\nHowever I Would also like him to learn more about

focused on financial education for your kids you know we lament\nIn this country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nUh parents seem to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics drugs sex but they're not talking about money\nSo I'm really glad that you are and because we have so many Americans growing up financially illiterate they're not taught me this and K. through twelve or they aren't getting any college classes on their employers are certainly not selling that much about money so I'm really glad you're getting your kids off on the right foot\nI'm going to give you two answers\nFirst is my first book the truth about money\nOr that book is considered a classic in the field a personal finance was named book of the year I'm

states and everything in between\nUh and the first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what is money how does money work of understanding compound growth\nA and the very basics of money so I Would encourage your kids to read the truth about money second\nI'm going to direct you to a website called jumpstart dot org\nThe jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy is a nonprofit organization that serves\nIt was a clearing house they collect uh information and resources from dozens maybe even hundreds of organizations academic
