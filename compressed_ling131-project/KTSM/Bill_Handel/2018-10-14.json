out\nSo you want a lawyer that'll take equity in a house the practice has elder abuse and we had a phone and we had a phone call or\nThat there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one\nThey're old with taking the elder abuse case ... nobody um who will take and I assume on contingency or take a a lien against a household lie about an hour\nA hundred hundred an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law I don't you don't care for the lawyer has knowing Marion sons\nCan pass the bar I'll do other work\nWhat ... what do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nLegal documents I Love to do it my hobby\nDidn't want to do that then ... is this for you of course then why don't you wait a second then why don't you represent yourself\nBecause what kind of like why they say owning it for that because of the doubt\nWell let me a a sixty one year old lawyer who has never written a document regarding elder abuse in his life uh that's probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he has a choir behind the room\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think someone who has Esquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed about what was the case dismissed\nNo I think that they're going to die for their dollar an hour he couldn't take\nHow did you lose Mary how to how we thank you lost the case how does

dollar an hour for something new because they're\nAll right well you you have the word out ... ah well you can leave your name and number and if Mr sixty one year old lawyer who's never done a case in his life ever who just passed the bar and do you think you going to file an appeal now I have been a lawyer for over Thirty years you know that Mary\nWell why don't you hear about having\nA problem is I Would never I don't have the skill set to ride an appeal I Would never dream of writing an appeal I just don't have that skill set that's right I Want it so but you want someone with no skills said just because they are best square behind their name\nWell it's better than the lunar well\nNo it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does or you press just because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means it's not saying\nWell maybe you mean something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers ah ... never get that\nAll right ivory\nThere you go higher ivory welcome to handling law we're going to do for you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I took out a two year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise]\nAnd and that was in two thousand six to ... thousand Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house yeah and I don't know what they were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own and stone made for a couple of months\nI finally called the the main office and explain to them what was happening and that my front porch wear loose in my own they sent their representative out\nExterminated again and did another aspects and told me that I now have subterranean termites\nSo he says you can get an extended war in the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but he had seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the document\nWe were talking that don't matter but you didn't read the document [noise] no I didn't okay oh I Know\nAll right so you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay what's okay\nSo at this point I accepted it another imitation from another company to come into an expectation that was in July now mind you march is when both termites were treated again the other company findings where it's at major infestation of both [laughter]\nSo I contacted the state of California pest control and they had no record whatsoever it that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it because I was ... why would the state of California keep her record of maternal my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit a W in the form notify them\nThat really okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I have to do it within ten days wow I didn't know that okay so every time they treat they have to let the state no we just treated a home here's the address right right by all day news ...\nSo they told me there in violation and that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nLet me you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation internally or you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to\nThey're coming in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that uh that ordinance that statute it would be and\nUh you got a small claims to that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the turn of my company or or a third provider no from the same\nTurtle okay you're you're you're in pretty good shape a you have to go and you have to go out get another term my company to straighten all of that out including the term I damage treat everything and just to I'm a small claims court\nOkay now my question is I Would like to know what type of attorney do\nI Am all claims court you soon do you do it in small claims court you don't need an attorney\n[noise] okay now I just want the damages will not be more than ten thousand dollars\n[noise] okay All right\nAnd ah and make sure you tell that complicated history to the small claims judges probably going to ...

All right you're you're saying uh the form he's asking you to fill out a W to form or or you know on a previous W to form for a previous job\nA ... a previous that we have to form a\nFor free for previous jobs yeah no it doesn't ... doesn't have the right to do that or because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary was it started because it's not his business how much money you earned it the previous in employment\nSo no cars you know he doesn't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\nAround ... why is that\nYeah there's a bigger law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously ... and it don't get a W to form a previous double your true form says exactly that also even if it wasn't the lie just saying you can't do that you say no\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a\nSo uh no I don't think ah that works or John Hi John you're up\n[laughter] that rent but not now um they pay 'em the amount that they're claiming that there are no damage to their\nCurrent so you're talking about the so you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the heart of Mary now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they have they're on a hot it that they\nHave yeah they do that all the time All right so what's your question [laughter]\nSo my question is I I brought it up are claiming that I'm you know I mean I called and emailed them\nWell okay so what is going on right\nOkay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there is no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting us from damage or to the property so I assuming that\nThere is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where to put the security positive towards the last one threat and you're saying no you can't do that\nSo you have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash so so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and then\nIs if there are damages beyond that\nThen of course you sue them in small claims court [noise] and you know then you so then you do then you do then you have a small claims shoe\nBut other than that no we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve oh\nYes sir I've yet to you

you're you I Would let them know that you're paying the money are based on the fact that they won't turn title over to you even though you believe that\nUh they don't have the right but you need to sell the car I put to all of us in writing\nAnd and ah then you turn around you sue him [noise] or the money better on their minds court that the important thing is that you have to have title and

All right so yeah I Know your brother is not responsible just someone is trying to get some money that's all and it's just yeah it's a crock a you're not responsible for anybody's funeral expenses at all ever unless it is a child\nA unless it is a I think where you have ordered it and said okay I'm taking the body out but the retina\nYeah not not not after that\nAll right Jennifer Hi Jennifer yes\nWell we uh we feel like someone who has the power of attorney or a family member is\nAbusing the family member finances they're they're using her money for themselves and how do you how do you how do you know that\nBecause they've had power of attorney they bought a new home and they they read anything interesting they\nAll get him ... ... and All right fair enough and how much money\nOr does the power of attorney person have control over\nAll of it probably at least five hundred to seven hundred thousand\nAnd a lot of it may be gone so ah what ... yeah so I it first of all I tried to police\nAnd if not that a a lawsuit\nA that's a where of course there'll be a judgment against that person and hopefully the police will get involved because it's simple fact\nThat's what this is this just stealing money uh this is a and the argument is fraud became power of attorney under false pretenses if you can get the da and balls if you can get the cops and ball that's going to help you a lot otherwise you're going to have trust in the state attorney and try to get what you can first of all the account has to be frozen completely\nThat's the first thing\nIs how do we get all ... yeah yeah yeah you know I get a lawyer this is this was one where it's a above your pay\nGrade yeah you're going to need even in need of trust in a state lawyers figure this one out instantly and you want to get one like tomorrow kind of thing and uh make a motion to freeze everything pending and this is where you go into court ah with an emergency order\nAnd I that the court to freeze which which court will do and then you start trying to figure out how much money this person has stolen\nA from your loved one yeah it's no fun when that happens whole\nDamn good high game right [noise] okay yeah so\nUh [noise] I'm a software developer and uh I developed some software or a fetus studios\nThat actually was a young wrestle show [laughter] and uh [laughter] but I just want to know if I have a case against that basically my cousin which I Do not have a contract with a is the one that\nYou know a God of the deal and a contract between young on a wrestler and my cousins company and I developed a software and so we should receive licensing fees every year okay uh for the software\nAre complaining and even the fact that she was tied into the beginning of the\nYeah and and and let me look at how many how many years ago it was a seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're going to be counted but yeah you're gonna make life miserable so uh\nIf you want you you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a represent their lawyers who represent warriors in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was ah oh and I I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handling the law the advice I give because some people it took me to sleep\nI relied\nOn that so anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now and bother so it's your call your call do I think anything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the white you were a notch\nA bean I you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there you are owed anyway yes\nI'm\nA God I hate these winds All right let's try it ah but starting young\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send a guide to the moon that doesn't even work anymore in the last time there was a guy on the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send the guy to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right\nOh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Chris oh yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a ... tax return from Eighteen years ago [noise] it's hard to get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around either can't be found a somewhere out there I remarried died whatever so\nI there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your taxes or do you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere I could do it then you have ... I haven't I haven't a point or the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is on it yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know what I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up to my account and Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the IRS and yet I didn't\nMind it for ... that I actually find it might go and uh maybe no picnic or just magically appear\nNo no I I Would I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is\nDo I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I about\nSeventy grand behind it All right that's another issue and this and you and and you may be\nAble to get the whole thing okay based on the child support order so\nI the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off needle grab people's money\nYeah our cases in at that stage right now we're ... supposed to be surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to you and I are US Agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rules specifically and ... it doesn't have any experience or or it doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as if a an iris Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books sick\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to a man after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I Would have said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously on Rick Perry yeah All right so is there any of 'em out there should get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do
