don't know but for you argue in the service animal business\nThen are you um you would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want ... charge extra so like the bottom line is that you are one service animal and ... it's now this is just an emotional service animal or is it a ... in Mosul support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for the most most\nThe jello yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't be right [laughter] yeah yeah that now I understand right now\nI why someone would ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't a shame

I don't know nothing about that too broad a manager out I gave him the document and the email and he goes\nOK well we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a cart was showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least at that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal that you need about what our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'd go but it says you by micro no matter what buyers are not actually as\nWell and they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars\nWhen did you jump on it or even though they watch the lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler [laughter] I bought one from across the street from a ... from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand miles a year in my car sits on the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered it yeah they're going to buy your car back ah and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they're listening to you yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach which is one of the damages a and that here's here's\nWhere I figured out the doubt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right now I got it okay all I have a a you could sell the car or to anybody else at whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was with a hundred and ... percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the least at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so uh what I mean we only on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they were going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer that's the problem with the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... or the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and ah the formula I didn't understand a word of it so ah that works out now isn't it\nYou can't ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty or a hundred and wide to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy Hi Tammy\nYes good morning do yes ma'am my question\nIs I Am one of four owners or on a property and I have them pay the property taxes for several years I have a recourse can I put a link\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you get what you can do is sue the other ones for their pro rather share okay that's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you say several years all over the course of those years or how much have you paid in taxes\nOkay because something somebody is making a mistake doesn't work for\nThe new the new and said what we bought it so it just starts\nAll over again it's not true well that's what they told me I don't\nKnow if I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... okay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yes absolutely entitled on and it's still on the credit report correct okay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that\nThey have nothing to do with it or threaten them or I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting\nTo [noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports that's that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively ... especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years of dropping from the credit report and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone\nIt's crazy I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that\nHappening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had ah the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example when on paper to ... a credit card or any written a contract\nAnd a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ... agencies have called and people know there was a four year statute\nAnd they'll say hey this was five years to go\nThere is a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they change the law last month it's now a ten year statute\nAnd what do you do well my clients said okay just send me just give me the code just told me don't get the bill number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh oh\nYou know that's sort of thing and horrible rolled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole is I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit\nBut it's a it has to explode just has to explode\nAll right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old in a clothing store and you're trying to prepare the camp she walked up to the girl checked the items or she checked committed something I'm not sure what she did she handed the farmers factor\nShe went and tried in on the parents want him to step device about the cover and its last scratch your leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches ooh they're anything there I mean is there anything there and he told me about the scratch or was the was the femoral Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out is a\nThinking more about the stress but we went\nOut All right no no there's no one cares about your stress that for a ... that's the way out of ...\nFor HP wait a second an aids test because one of those security devices scratched her and you did an aids test\nWell how many people on the other ups crash but how do we\nRight okay so you did the AIDS test and of course came up negative\nOkay now what that's why I'm Out there no\nNo and matter of fact there is not good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the eight\nOr ... yeah no there's nothing there there's there I mean theoretically that she'd go to the doctor that you get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an an emotional issue when you get scratched [laughter] so no\nThere's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is there I have my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where you see fault too how do I get\nMoney I said how do I get money and then we start\nTalking about well what what happened and oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught uh I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case oh why not\nMiss I miss welcome to handle I'm a law\nSure\nI got a problem I have a like a fake that's that's what they can ... less than half hour and they haven't had that and I doubt it I Want to I mean right at the end\nFor what I mean how much you pay how do\nI Know how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI have\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they're fixing half an hour or did they give you a big do they give you a an estimate\nAlready did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed\nAnd when did they did they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the fact they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo not All right and just don't pay\nA well then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so uh and then there's the issue of\nUh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right does the work they did\nWhat do you think you should pay I don't know much about it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut that is\nWhat do you mean you have now did you hear them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the proof that you pay them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying it's too much and you and you want your money back and they overcharge you okay and you didn't know they overcharge you until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollars you\nCan now look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety an act of Congress creates Yosemite National park homeless such

have the beauty pageant they sure do the one that got me started\nMy picture in the papers someone on the coast side the picnics this afternoon to everyone in town will be there why don't you come with a picnic\nBetter than I have to go I'm On the food committee and by the lifeguard [noise]\nA presentation that we do with our with our students I'm a parent nights as well to discuss um the upcoming events and faster and faster nights were so so excited about these because that's just a great opportunity for our parents to come into our campus\nAnd fill out the the information and really get to know um the ins and outs of of how to help their child I'm complete that application and and then as they get finished then they they see that while yes that's it's a\nThere is that like at the end of the tunnel they're actually you can go ahead and get you know pay for school\nThey can get there so what kind of information to people meet together to them you know be able to fill up before\nSo they wouldn't eat their um their tax information so um our parents would need to bring in there will be two forms um and being that information and um and they also need to know of course you know their their their information such as their Social Security numbers for their children\nUm anything involving their finances um and that's what they would it would need for them basically\nSolar taxes like they'll get their tax forms the property taxes will home valuations that kinda stuff just basically their financial situation to vote and cops would on that forum and so once they get there or the FAFSA married mhm what happens to them\n[noise] so um that's probably a said we we have a wraps for that I Will come from um our chamber of commerce are a bank some of our um a UPC ... financial officers will come in and and help our parents um fill up the the questions because you know there's some questions there that perhaps\nUm parents may have\nA question about for ... for example if they had completed their taxes but then their financial situation changed so and this school year for example so then you know those those individuals those experts can go ahead and give that\nI'm vice says how to fill out that that question there\nWeren't so the events for up so much for pit bull he'll be coming up on October each team but this is a whole series going on this whole moms and even into next month right\nYes and actually we have we will solve ... about this we're going to be um we already kicked off October first with the first a series of ... and like you said they're going to go away till November the eighth and they're going to be in all like from end to end of all pass so we're going from like tour Neal all the way to\nI Can't even think of the far east a far west face so if it and another thing though that um is really nice is that\nThese posts we have a posters that really mad at each school\nTo to promote and showed us students where these events are going to be at so if you can attend the one at your school for whatever reason you can look at that and be able to go to another event so that way you can uh be able to such a path and like I said it's all about being around those people who are experts in and be able to answer those questions you might have\nAnd I know like I said and you it's daunting when they had in the financial information but really pretty much\nUm once you have that checklist of what you need if you just get that information is going to be a lot easier for you to fill that out at that moment and waiting till the end when you're trying to figure it out on your own\nThis is true I mean you know Europe of support after you've a device going on but questions because you'd be happy information you might not necessarily get the mindset that performance asking for right and so you have the people there to explain it I mean it's really important that even if you're not you know a student or a parent's attached to pedal hills high school you can still come to that event correct\nThat's correct and that's what we also do a show with our students um some of our students may not be able to attend the event but as long as that there'll be other\nSofter nights at the other high schools even outside our district and so we're we're very fortunate that I think our city or chamber um our community has come together to really get that information to our our our families so that our our students can go ahead and I know do what they need to do so they can have that ... ... secondary success\nRight so what are some of them the most common questions that come up during these events what are some of the the kind of sticking points that people run into or they're trying to get through this and if they really need that ...\nI think one of the things I see a lot is that is prior to them that you're fast so there's a thing called an ...\nEssay id and that's something that you need to apply for\n'em in order to um because when you're doing it fast but it it's their SATs almost like an ... an identification number for you I'm so people get confused with that and um it's real simple process and also you can go on on the website to the government website and apply for it I had a time\nWhen you go to pass the night you're not there having a figure that out at that moment\nSo I really encourage the parents and the high school students to talk to their counselors because they have all the information in terms of making it easier for them you know yes\nAnd that's actually what we've done a couple of hills um our counters went ahead and we are meeting with our students and providing that website and that time in the school day to go ahead and apply for their fast I mean because I said it's a it's a process where you go online and you submit your\nYour information um and your Social Security number and you just submit that to the government and then um the falcon rank comes back with an email with your um identification code\nSo that would be your way to sign your document um of course now I'm everything's on line as far as the applications concern and the parents would have to do the same thing so we can help our students um other with us in a campus um but parents when you also have their own essay ID\nSo go oh there's a lot of ground work and then coming to the FAFSA met a lot of stuff that needs to be done ahead of time but it doesn't hurt if you if you do it but if you're trying to do it all at once can be a little overwhelming yeah but this is true for it is it what what was the biggest misconception people have about the whole process\nI think one thing that I hear a lot is that well a financial for for instance if your family if you think you make us over the certain amount of money you feel like you shouldn't apply because what for my child her daughter is not going to get any money so I'm not going to apply for people\nHave this misconception of that and they also have the misconception of immigration status\nSo people are really afraid to fill it out because of the immigration status but there are so many different alternatives for that that people aren't aware of and that's why it's so important to come and just ask the question because I think a lot of times people are afraid or they just don't know so they just decide not to do it it's always better to ask the question\nAnd and you'll see that potentially you'll come out ahead of that\nExactly that every time they ever did was swimming the absolute so again pretty much all financial aid I'm ready to come not even from the federal government building from the state level right often gets routed through this form notice right\nNext to exactly right and\nAnd we always encourage students as we speak to them that um the FAFSA is you know this whole um huge a piece of information that if as long as they get that application in there that can be eligible for all these types of aid it's not just the grants and so I'm an over the free money so yes\nSo it's very important again that FAFSA nights series is happening now through November aid at a fifty plus high schools throughout our region that again October Eighteenth is the one for pedal hills but again you can go to anyone anywhere in our area we're talking with Diana Enrico had counsel for pedal hills high school and college
