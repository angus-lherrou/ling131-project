at this place that I go to regularly\nAnd I use the restroom there plenty of times before it was one particular day\nThey told me that the policy change and drivers weren't allowed to use the restroom so I asked to work and I go to guy Floyd style but he says go find a port a potty that we have a ... for the drivers so I walked around the facility didn't see a port a potty came back to them uh told them they looked real you said there was a port a potty there is nothing\nCan I usually go to the restroom now he's like telling me now because you can't use the restroom so I told them you know it shouldn't be against the wall for you to operate a business\nAnd conduct business and not have restroom so I don't know where I stand on\nI well first of all in a I don't think there is a law but even if there is a law I it he can say to the public or you can say non employees you can't use our bathrooms there's ... ... ... you can do that\nI found it absolutely nothing no longer than nothing a driver can do now how big a facility is is that you're a delivering to\nIt's a pretty substantial\nSo why would why wouldn't you call the uh the supervisor or the president of the company and go are you serious or your boss and go are you guys serious we can't use a bathroom there\n[laughter] yeah my mom did that they were they were pretty uh they were pretty pretty pretty old and a ... you know

together and if I may I Am I responsible for that\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know why would you marry someone who is such an auditor flake that he hasn't filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pay the taxes they haven't found the fact\nThat how does that keep just write the check to the IRS no no\nNo I mean that has come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that I just had to file that yeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually think up until maybe\nBut I'm Wondering if I marry him and my response though\nOr how you're only responsible for being stupid and I'm now well that's a given but I Know I mentioned part that I Love you and I'm not\nThere to see the will lessen well we can have that conversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues you just keep\nWhat am I so I guess I couldn't expect\nOh that's another thing suing the VA will you oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing call contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about which I rarely do All right go for it\nSam Hi Sam Europe [noise] yes [noise] [noise] hello Sam yes yes wait a minute we're going to do for you Sam ... morning how are you sir\nI could do a couple of years ago I found that in the works because my wife she is she going to like ... ... and I'm from the need for them to me\nThat his horse I knew I mean five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin bankruptcy and if I call them if you take it a kind of way\nNow to get to know if it's a car loan you\nProbably don't have a enough equity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed a how much money do still on the car\nOr how much\nYou're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nMaybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want\nOh okay I don't worry about it that that part is\nAnd that's usually the case is a assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation the splits up the assets but cars are almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have is er is exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there was alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance the carnival the second you drive off the lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty\nMuch a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I Hope I'm like oh you know

I talked to an attorney or because there was enough there are now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars taken a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's all gone uh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where he's a lawyer yet that where's the lawyer get paid\nYeah so there has to be she spent the money a regime and what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make somebody said if you go to and file ... they can make make myself um I Do say the\n... the executor I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file the escorts\nFreeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state lawyer I go to the website to do that because there's a lot of pieces on this one for sure sunny hello Sonny\nBono [noise] probably more in the crowd at grad school to let that you don't have\nTo analyze itself okay that I it and I do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's a these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need that you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\n... data that that's how they\nAre yeah became in Georgia you don't have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\n[noise] okay Colorado law\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny are are you are you ... are you broke [laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nA lot of folks that are out there and my mom or a bill and uh this lawyer is spreading or\n... or it was a it was a a lot of a combination they say no forty thousand dollars and so when the that I gave them they uh they they're fair game and I asked them what to do it\nIf they said that they have to get and pay I pay for the deaths of that but the average it out\nAnd okay I none of this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate in two seconds that's that's a public record\nYeah you're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyers gonna take designed contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour so called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia\nAll right All right All right All right good luck you know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale\n[laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome\nOh okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and\nAnd get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law incidentally the law started\nNot as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nOr Stevie hello Stevie or you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I'm going to just continue my insurance or with Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty\nOn me sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty why would you give up your I help ensure victory Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that you'll be\nOkay so so really what I'm saying well the reason I'm going to do it is because I have guys are so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not the habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty in ...\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea\nYeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidized that would be hilarious that would be all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but they subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so I'm like no legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation but the Republicans tried to appeal you know they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a law that you introduce right now\nSo this could take this one new chicken take\n... years but a neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nUm yeah I had a partnership with the people that uh we we were down ... years ago we had to recollect filed bankruptcy personal bankruptcy it before so I was able to file on it but that my partner filed bankruptcy on the stand up\nAnd they don't come back after\nA well what kind of ... first of all was talking about the business was in a in a wealthy or corporation\nTo get the partnership\nA and yes they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can re filed with any\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about Pam\nIt went right back when the ...\nAnd why did he go under none of that and then there weren't enough customers are wearing\nDown after\nYou got ... kind of a neighborhood where you and that was so crazy\nValley huh wow why\nIt got really bad after that it said it was like I filed care\nNo because you have a partnership and now what happens is uh you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's in your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's a two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy why wouldn't you do an El Al see or a corporation\n[noise] yeah I Do I Do yeah oh she said\nIt you know I'm a Democrat so I didn't have to say\nAlthough I'm going to repeat it Dorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nAh yeah it's like a long

you have absolutely no ... alright\nHenry Europe welcome to handle on the law Yes sir\nYes bill my wife worked for for better care uh\nThat's usually where they get pedicures you know it was on your feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nGo in any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe and or in the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise]\nSo we went to emergency and the ... part of her male off but it was in fact do the pedicure so we gave her medication antibiotics they stay off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't and got it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pay there are other co payment\nAnd then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor show the next day she and her doctor to doctor said I Can't do it our need to send you to a specialist so she was off work for four days into the specialist or the following week again she missed like six seven days\nBy the time we seen the specialist it got worse they had to remove the whole now\nAnd she couldn't go to work again\nSo she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a\nCase well yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world's going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's nothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims that he's going to hear a small claims\nA a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the person the other side of that if I'm being sued and I run the nails will a shop and he goes hey wasn't me you've got the impression it someplace\nElse so I it's one of those and also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that although I don't again I don't know how much money you're going\nYeah so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife when making a she\nWorks part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what did she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down\nA and breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance so the other thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and do what do you wanna do you want me to to you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese\nRight you know I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShoot they carry insurance [laughter]\nYeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of in ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm ... yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe we'll give it to human trait you got three thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that\nA lotta pedicures\nJerry Jerry welcome to handle on the law\nRight now I'm going through a divorce oh I'm I'm Still waiting for the first court so we can go to court for the mediator\nNow so why are turning me a letter wanted me to go to their office and they want me to bring in my national record I got up and they want me to answer the question under oh I like that that position I obligated to go\nThere yes if you're a subpoena you're obligated to go to a deposition and uh you have to bring a lawyer Jerry you can't do this on your own\nBut I I don't I don't like the United states is over with\nYeah so far request that you know what you have not been mandated to a desk or a deposition yet\nOdd because it just a letter saying we'd like to depose you okay ah no I mean they have to actually uh send you a legal document saying we are going to be deposed back and forth that's the way I understand it I don't do a divorce law but I don't think it's just by letter\nI because you know you say no now the court could order it but again it has to be a court order it has to be under\nA the guise of a court order in other words has to be a legal document which letter is not Jerry\n... and it came from or a hurting\nI understand now again but it's just a letter\nFrom well I'm Sorry I'm not I'm\nNot a Muslim or not if it's just a letter you're obligated not you but you but you need a ... year but they're going to get a hose you'd be they're going to depose you and I'm\nNot the only one fifty fifty well I don't have nothing else so I don't understand it I don't want to spend money and then the journey because I figure it's easy for property\nAnd I think I I think what's Sandra Tsing she's off the phone is I think she's trying to somehow rationalize away the fact that she got totally bamboozled and was\nImmediately a versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... yeah I don't think so\nHighmark yeah oh I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front for a\nTotal of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and in payments for the next seven years I took the trucks down to the bank and the new account specifically for those\nAre the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through was notified by the bank or something to mail a return on a stop payment on a second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their heads gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a car they're ignoring you send it to all the different\n... and how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or ... days or weeks ago All right well a couple of weeks ago is not enough time\nFor all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know what they do and I just I ...\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement [noise] uh that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled that\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more so question and then we turn around and see how much interest you're paid and soon as small claims court for the interest you lost\nOr you go okay well you'll get paid more guy it's it that's world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance you're canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh bye hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine homes we when we bought a house um where was given an excuse me a fee than are\nThat are limited what we could do a lot and what we could do with our home\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that\nEach of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura or the city approved the flooding of the lot and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of that the sea and are in a number of different ways\nI wanted to know what our record the record on now you\nAre you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against them just because the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the H away also can control\nAnd they can say no more than one lie or one home for a lot now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there that in fact represent nothing but H always okay\nSo you get to go just go on go on the Internet and check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAll right max\nHi good morning for yes or is it strictly a horse [laughter] okay I'll Try it but yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I never heard that one before ever an accent much of that yeah for\nFor a while now asking [noise] anyway uh anyway they shorted me based on the estimate the space for the minute they shorted me eight or Ninety seven dollars\nYeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go on it and that is anyway uh anyway but I get I filed it small claims court trade are there in Ninety seven dollars and the way they came with a check for five hundred\nThe verbiage on the checks as if I take a check or that negates for claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I tell you a check\nBecause I Know in ... in court if I take I checked us at ...\nYeah yeah yeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you accept is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their body is to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and file and small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's a\nGood look here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works 'cause normally they would kick it right up the superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge or where we small claims judge which are usually not judge has a and daddy is a and this happens all the time would be companies immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage\nBy dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're gonna lose walking in the door they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise] this is handling the [noise]\n\n\nUh\nAnd now the hard radio we can sports time capsules\nHey fellow sports fans it's any west that I'm here to take you on a
