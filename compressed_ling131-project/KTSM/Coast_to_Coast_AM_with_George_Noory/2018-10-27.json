then try to explain that coming up later on okay how does that jar move on its own and then the thing with the pencils I I don't know your ... believe me there's there's a lot to talk to a and about coming up\nOn coast to coast am and we'll start with Michael Guillen who is here the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel the no prophecy he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spent a lotta years in Boston\nAnd Harvard day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and a hard [laughter] I understand that that's why I asked ... uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I\nI I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary Roach\nOh you're missing missing terrific come in and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and but very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she loves to explore particular subjects and\nSo her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff or ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen and she just love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her in this kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I have you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I spent fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can uh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories um onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King can\nCan remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third it has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to do with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran ... are being very very involved well you

various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as author and the new book is uh is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving a physical life uh on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nUh trying to get their hands on some DNA some you know frozen are preserved DNA and then the whole idea is to then bring back the wooly mammoth and that's going on right now a including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are I Do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the natural\nFlow were defined the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice to nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine I it was very mired in for a merger and right now and we all know margarine is not so great for like\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a\nPrice and he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you\nKnow a ... billion according to science you know billions of years of evolution right are we to do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah I you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or a beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not hosting the debt smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the sun but\nHe recently applied to the artist and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface it sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing is he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on it ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they can control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready\nThe warship it because we want to stay on its good side because God that this technology we're creating well run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it would be the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance to say you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go\nYou know ... you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pets offer you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall E N\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers are not just going to become fans there they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're general ... button that up by saying they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general IQ is for seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equivalent IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah\nI think the interesting these are the two is it ... the equation is with you used it a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with like you won twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average you know like using a drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine\nNo I like that the cushy Murphy up yeah eat 'em right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose\nA yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers now how is raising with that the right now I fully believe that completely and I do and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour because I'm saying like like marriages like democracy like friendship [noise]\nI think our life

I Know several people who have a ... who had a\nTrouble walking or the lost their ability you'd walk on the bench mine all injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\nI I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement are called the trans human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd and now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thoughts so they're they're wired to his\nMind and I mean isn't fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in a military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so for a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons\nI I think that's a I I\nThink it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being\nFacetious I think that's the only one I'm here's what it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead\nTo what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and ah you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah I Know\nAnd and now and and the coalition a group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race\nRight yeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we had our just still the same you know so\nOh our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate\nThe Sarah Connor conundrum\nNot the Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism and so\nYou know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending randomly and there were some Terminator but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going uh and his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientists I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old had on the new body right\nYeah yeah okay or had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween\nHe kind of moments right there were like All right now there is this is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they\nThe the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and\nThere's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted uh\nFrequently or who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nFor his safety still to this day it is the NFL's number one bloopers\nThis week

D. as them [noise]\n\n\n\nMichael before we start getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before we get because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a the these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the hospital and then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nAnd that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they will have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like it was like\nNo they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where great science writing in science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um ... playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah yeah I don't give a little plug for an up [laughter] and I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a ... fine it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a\nTheoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I'd I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiment that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so beyond the you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like that guy now running it's like\nRunning on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nThat's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know when you get some coffee yeah I get that I think that happens with them\nOur technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop\nYou know the ... a piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and plug it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher six so Jack Lew is exactly where I'm living and by the way to is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to David who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by doing the strings artificial intelligence\nUm one would be\nYour keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives us something really good\nQuestion [laughter] yeah they do we just losing\nWe just lost\nA no Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have admitted for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nYeah I uh enjoy your show but um [noise] I've been on a machine going on forty five years yes\nEr here and I was a backyard or do generation I'd like to know from your guest or where do you feel that the shoe will be overcome through CRISPR or a maybe a genetically modified pig I'll take my answer off the air\nAnd hang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine is\nHe on he's on dialysis is on kidney stones and he is not your generation\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where are the technology really is very hopeful um they they are making enormous strides now uh with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but we're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight to people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also in the kidney from I don't think we need to create these primarily\nA there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells or it might create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very hopeful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael ... book picks up the rest of the thank you so much

dot com and watched this video of the Oregon pot shop and the moving jar if you didn't here's the story on coast to coast am wrote down\nIn downtown Oregon City here are very different at least that's the\nTheory behind paranormal activity witness that fine zero trees candidates dispensary now\nBehold if you dare this surveillance video from August watched the glass tip jar on the counter slowly it starts to move that's Andy ... next to it\nI thought it was happening and I thought like somebody was standing there like somebody was like right here\nSuddenly the jar falls off the level surface that does happen then Andy remember this surveillance hand like we saw this I\nNot long after that this happened watch the Penn ... it's completely skill and no one's around when suddenly the pans begin to move\nAnd if you think the videos been dumped her as a candidate shop that would be against the law and I say they set aside many as GM Samantha Davidson says at the turn of the century this building space with\nYou as a form of ... so yeah so this could have been a pharmacy and maybe there's no real explanation for why there are goes there\nBut that video ... especially ... and the fact that we were really got me was because it's a candidate shop law mandates they can't touch the video\nSo what was it I don't know but if you go and look at it you want to jump in an open lines of loved to have you let me go to a Mike in Charlotte North Carolina on coast to coast to get started Mike\nGood morning hours y'all [laughter] we're good thank you\nYeah Halloween all out of the night the hills run the road with the blood to edible or children\n[laughter] yes well anyway and right now right now not enough runs in the Los Angeles because it's now going into the are going to be in

by robots now\nBut it all gang because you\nCan't show [laughter] so I guess some of the feelings and the personality of the I I'm with you in your it I mean we're the incident in\nThe Bible says that there are where nothing because they sleep\nRight uh you know we can try to play God but I I I it's impossible because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's bad enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated so a lot of people would say that and it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were why wouldn't it have a soul\nIf other people out there have you know\nUh other meant if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human than they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with you in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul\nBut I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because that used to be the thing that people said about test to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we got a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I don't want to apologize first of all for not listening for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm after last night I have a couple of things to say on this whole in March ... her saying I'm a revival manner awarded a habit of the things he could've tapped or to survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and I said environment now and furthermore it our current situation right now we have\nThere are a lot of people story not first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nFor years to come for for senses\nFamilies with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple multiple and um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not fees are usable plans we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies which has done some you know in a cave or in a whole or in a sketch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt that on your way to I'm following scare myself\nNot to a consuming somebody's supplies but just chew on myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give a trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies they just see if somebody could even his than themselves\nAnd interesting you don't really know even with these like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know it's going to survive it could be a child it

such a great privilege it if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible\nA and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that you study whether it be science or whether it be a viable for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three of the model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the ... the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\nWell and the new this and the new ... the the ... yeah I mean\nThe the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical values a historical cruise you know that that line up\nWith a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because of the historical value of the book Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for Daniel to know as much of the future is he as he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the troops there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the Old Testament and the New Testament this has done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a skilled in\n... it's called proof texting and it's yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've said it before I go to ... but it's one of the first thing I learned in seminary was\nThat some people um some people rely on a on scripture\nI'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support\nAnd I think it's the illumination part that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a um I I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told and I was interested in\nHow many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform\nThat the basis for that it starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do what\nI found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the Bible and the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used\nUh the Arabic word is that Jesus was murdered and I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it and he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot\nWhen we think about him in a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity has a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies you'd think that that has hurt us and gotten us away\nFrom a from the\nCentral message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime

Jesus yeah I'm\nFrom the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published or and or\nLike you know eight um apparently with what they say according to the production of ... it was kind of transcribe a written that transcribe by Levi Dowling transcribe it from the classic record for no also known as God for book of remembrance of the way of putting it [laughter]\nI'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways for for gospel um and and describing like Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his life\nOr the highlight of locking in years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm not I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with the Quakers and I've had it with\nThe idea of um the beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat and oh yeah ours is that I'm going\nTo determine I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes\nI think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or is this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism Neal Marxism and you know all we can never do is the arise because we can't there's no there's no met a\nData somewhere that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make ten ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that just otherwise would be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years I'm big because there's a lot of different books that address that um well did they all tell the same story though do you\n[noise] I don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right ... years I'm ... I didn't want to a wrap it up quickly on there's a lot I could go with you about this book I wanted to say um I\n... I kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something that earlier caller you\nThink about the liar along the lines of [noise]\nUh ... your freedom we ah we we all worship something you know whether it's money or ... or whether it's gone or so [noise] um that we really appreciate Mr your [noise] your true can work your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think there's ...\nSure ... you know we have this freedom but we don't always use it responsibly oh yeah we have a responsibility not correct so individually or can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more have some kind of shared

importance or security I'm I'm On board with that [noise]\nBut when people talk about the border that makes it as a country that's just not true you know it's up the border that makes me in Arizona in ... or soon to be a a a Kansas and it's not like you can cross the border that exist on a piece of paper [noise]\nIt I think what holds together our values and that's what I you're most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every educations START I agree with that but it's loose shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers based the entire country I think that's\nWhat we need to always focus on [noise]

some time to talk about the future of privacy where we rest right now at this frontier of all of this home technology with Michael Guillen in a moment but I I wanted to wrap up\nThe conversation about uh about trends humans as you talk about them in the book people who are becoming part of something else or use physical\nUm enhanced Smith from technology to be able to compensate for\n'em either for injury or for deformity and there's a couple of those that are very entertaining like the guy with the built in vibrate or in some of the other stuff that's in the book but the part I thought that was really interesting and I just I wanted to mention that because I\nThere does idea the eggs those skeleton I'm ... I Know several people who have a ... who has a\nTrouble walking or the last ... you'd walk into bed spinal injuries and and this to them as a dream I mean the I ... you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... or muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\n... I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a but where are you with that one\nNo I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that you have that discussion that I have in the book about\nTrans humanism and you know that's there's actually a movement a called the trans human movement where\nAs you say the uh the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable there's wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I there this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of the sky from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he'd lost both arms ... them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses but see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's\nArtificial arms you know that we're mechanical that requires you to wear a harness and you have to ...\nYou know these are these are arms that he can move with his thought so they're they're wired\nTo his mind and I and I said to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you\nKnow she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and maybe even end um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton I talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there yeah where you know write it just it just ... you know so so or a soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pounds back ...\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fell a skeleton to take some of that load off their own skeletons I I think that's a\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not\nBeing facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we can come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing any soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and I ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequence free is that I think that that's the ... I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see\nThat politicians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one but then in ... new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about enhancing sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go wrong there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I quote that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is\nVery upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling some of their stuff soon or using their own that says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right\nTo make the decision to shoot or not should in other words to give them complete autonomy\nAnd and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well\nGee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then that basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in we're going to be now and another escalating arms race right\nYeah ... ... in some ways you know ... that I often I often think to myself you know all this technology is brand new it's unprecedented but we can't are just still the same you\nKnow all our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses\nAnd are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses and our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose\nTo you maybe the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah\nConnor conundrum not the Terminator conundrum but the Sarah Connor tuna under which means if you can't win a conventional war because you're over well by the technology\nOf the your opponent you go unconventional and you go gorilla end this creates more terrorism ...\nYou know I mean that that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending for some term in there but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to you know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going [noise]\nUh and his weaknesses\nBut but positive for sitting because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a a new had an old hat on a new body right\nYeah yeah okay well had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now there's\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with that I could understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was brilliant and you wanted to put it on a new body but then where does that end and how far along are they in that pursuit\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up they they the the veins and the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now
