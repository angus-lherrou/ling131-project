like a ten to Fifteen Percent correction hair which already close to that\nUm we may make it you know in the next year but but this is the greatest bubble in modern history and it's been extended by six ten trillion dollars are free money printed\nSince two thousand nine and now a trillion and a half tax cuts from Trump two trillion repatriated from overseas this stuff just keeps piling in the

percent for the tech stocks and stuff\nAnd and this could be the beginning I've got some signs I can talk about and stuff but but this could be the beginning of it and\nAnd this is not something you want to sit through you know most of the time stocks go up and then they correct or twenty percent that's fine most people should sit through that not I call this a great reset this only happens once in a generation and even more so every Ninety years like a clock and we're coming right on that clock\nIn stocks can be down Seventy eighty Ninety percent and take twenty to twenty five years to get

things when\nThey're on a trip that's right well what did the indicators I mean the market the last two days is really taking it on the chin what's the cause for that is it just panic or what what's

well any time you get a major downturn a recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure and that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recessions is bad thing\nThey're good things um\nBut and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nUp six to seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies went under well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if you're the part Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a\n... most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities\nAnd then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why\nSixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people and that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides and the U.S\nIt's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized Puerto Rico because the U.S has always always robbing the best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\n[noise] so I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economically over the next year this country seems to be mired right now in a conflict\n... it's unbelievable I've never seen it this way yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy one\nYeah it does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for the first time in this zero our book\nThat that we're not just seeing a major boom peak globally and a major bubble and debt bubbles and all this de leveraging it and that that's going to make the next couple of years very ... what you do to leverage debt these bubbles burst I mean again\nSomebody stock account is worth two hundred thousand one day and then a year or two later it's worth fifty thousand you know like what happened I just lost that money and it's not coming back this time you know my home was worth three hundred thousand now it's worth a hundred and fifty and I'm underwater and I can't even ... take advantage of the lower rates so there there's there's\nAll that sort of stuff but but yes the the political polarity the reds versus blue I mean we've got shards from Pew Research that showed just in the last five and ten years that\nWe used to have both parties used to be more centrist not that far apart now they are extreme far apart there's the far right\nIs the far left and this is around the world but it's the most extreme here and Trump is playing this like a federal that's why how he won he picked off\nFar right and and win against the centrist Republicans and then the Republicans had to follow him because he now has the baton and he has all the power so so this is this is this is going to make this I'm much more difficult if the social and political level again down here\nTwelve years of recession twelve and I think now Fifteen Percent unemployment after hurricane or partisan you know the Republicans believed him and the Democrats believed her the men believed him don't women believe ... I've never I mean it this there was no common sense is really\nI think that the social unrest in this downturn is going to top the great depression where it was more people roaming around in their cars and not having housing and no jobs and soup lines this is going to be different people\nThe the blue and the red extremes are going to blame each other for the crisis to Republican and say you damn Democrats let all this debt run up and all this you know free money and stuff\nAnd the and the Democrats are and say Republicans you didn't let us stimulate on up and blah blah blah blah blah and and and they're gonna hate each other and and so I I think that's going to be the worst part of this that we really\nThings to what you're saying the timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September ... won the fellow who was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the meat\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position and we were coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketed gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like it made that finally Tom and then\nTrump got elected I mean we turn boys I mean when Trump\nHad that surprised when and the markets were had a two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... apple loving hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal\nThis is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that um and we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's going to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt as the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that's\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to even\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea which would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired after elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or best\nPolls on and no disaster we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two options I don't see this bubble lasting pass next to the end of next year but there there's a fifty fifty chance it's happening now and you don't want to get hit by that\nFlows forty pursue we know what's happening with overnight stocks I mean can you tell what could happen when the when the clock opens tomorrow\nYes yes uh China went down a little bit in China made the biggest what was the only stock

where the beach boys recorded dance dance dance with Glen Campbell playing the lead guitar intro would go on to become their twelve us how forty hit\n\n\nAnd welcome back to the grocery done with us we'll get your calls as well area within the can you predict out five years from now\n[noise] [noise] yes you know George or we can predict out decades I mean I was predicting this you know the trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation where they would predictably spent and when they would stop spending\nSo yes what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season that started in two thousand eight\nWill be over about probably about late two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see a global boom again from about twenty two thousand twenty three all the way into two thousand thirty six that'll be the next\nGlobal boom the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been thus far but even more so in Asia and especially in India and south east Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics of the United states has kind of the best house in a bad neighborhood\nOr where our demographics are we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll we'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready has been in commodities and\nThings like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent it worse so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bobble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money\nSo you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more on the downside of after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only difference\nOn George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate and more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes and young people at the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best place to be the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to pay for everything eighty three two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be the\nNext global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to to the economy\n[noise] well you know wars are actually stimulate up and a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world man makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scared\nAnd there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing is well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want it given too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so [noise]\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where I go to Peter in ... Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging now\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent so so they're they're at risk or two but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack a head of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take\nYou know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're going to take your deposits and we're going to convert them into equity in our dying bank who wants to equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your access money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly when it happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that's something we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nOr Mr ...

questions and I want to get a few legs and because\nI Want to HR twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and guts may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet\nThat they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it de leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nTwo thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be people like a hundred thousand dollars in the voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWhat well here's a I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nIn a ... you know permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks\nWho got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nIn the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period ... to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they just sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout this whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer as only benefited corporate including these tax cuts\nAnd has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line you\nKnow right if they don't spend it or just the you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron hello Harry Good them\nWell hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the bank's name I Can't stand just now but uh the taking the money I'm sleeping in my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nOkay I I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage has been it was kind of opposite of the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was forms were over expanding\nAnd borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do a bank if governments have to explode with money or pull accounts they're going to do for the more fluent towns and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with ... Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nFor telling you how can you think you\nAnd I think here I just think that part of one of my questions but before I ask that are directed and I can't even I have one of\nMy parents were flying a lighting up oh I'm In my head and humiliate crumbled and the combat comes flying\nRight yup they play all about timing\nIf all of that tiny one of my guiding the looming psychology I'm hearing that you just answered my question like\nA about the smaller amount so my Social Security income isn't that much um I don't have to worry about that so much as um as a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're gonna have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits off of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever's scenario\nAnd bank insurance does agree that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that's all right oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major clubs but the smaller accounts it it'd be spread out and a few accounts and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be way less vulnerable and and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people going to hit foreign deposit there's more Iceland\nWent down and basically stiffed all the foreign depositors in foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller towns domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again I still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just in general\nOpposite wind against those deposits in real estate loans business loans go bad they're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it they can't they can't watch those reserves\nAnd well that's a good point and Harry thank you were out of time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com bust\n...\n\nHi I'm Lana Clawson a farmer ...

paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message burying operations is\nWell welcome to the program Dr many mate is on coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this\nAnd for inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\n[noise] well I think it was because I almost died from anytime you know when my book the borders for normal first came out many people ask me if that was based on stories with my patients had told me but my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor is confidential\nAdopted bound by the Hippocratic Oath states that are doctors should not be Pete anything he told by Haitians and I don't so the material in my book was based entirely on my own personal experiences\nPie stories from my readers and for my audiences and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I have these experiences I think it is related to the fact that I had some close calls for that so many ... that [noise] um you know\nIt's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's going back Dr vehement moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago that's right I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans that had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never would pronounce clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I look at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the things after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close cause of death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have over my fear of dying and I found myself a shift from materialism into spirituality and then they and an increased need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual\nThe first couple the paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything that might just kind of ... the ... you know I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because I didn't think anyone would believe me\nAnd in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and when I went to um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez wow\nYeah that was that was quite dramatic I'm at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because it would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant so why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donated pollen allergen it transpired mhm with more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just feel like I'm donor bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nWell the super\n... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia who would you um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctors said we can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYeah was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to\nBe a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant\nHuh [noise] now that the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that the rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to contact them\nAnd I did read him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the ... was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow so he was flown back into the don't you send for in Washington DC and the team from the city where I live flew down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city\nAnd that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fined ever since\nThen have you still in touch with them the devil happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and we kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you save your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and it is here\nAltruism you know he said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive in one of the bases where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she can swab\nI said that's it yeah it just it takes a lot to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang and then um\nYears later my name came up on the computer and at that point he even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know we found out that he was a\nPerfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow who produce more stem cells\nAnd they gave him these injections for five days and then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live\n... yes we've become friends and I just saw not too long ago\nDr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the sidekick realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally

[noise]\nHowever since I had that experience and the taxi I'm able to help people distinguish between what's his psychic experience and what's a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person the something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed if they've lost it I'm a spouse or child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved fun\nSo let's say a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that and these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost of of a loved one will have some type of post death\nContact with a loved one\nEven if a person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\nUm in in fact you know an atheist and nice to have this experience as well as religious people\nYou see that everyone is psyche again I I tend to believe you and agree with you\nOK but uh when you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the the word psyche covers a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP\nOr telepathy or pay cognitive beams and other things you talk to both types of the stations and voices and so on deathbed visions near death experiences so certain types of fake experiences such as ESP until after\nThe extremely common and a lot of people have experienced that type of thing um for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that person then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about you right\nWhat does that very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or they have a path a fence but a lot of people are interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I start to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psychic roam out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better rather than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ability often runs in families [noise]\nOne of the teachers who was ... she gave me direction every single\nTime I had a question to put down whatever she was doing that you come over and you'll sit there and do you get it\nI aged forty and\nThe health care\nFinished high school to\nBe ... percent of getting your high school diploma is walking through those doors\nGetting your high school diploma a life changing experience it really is the chemicals were you want to go\nIf you were thinking of your high school diploma\nNear\nYou and then you ... or anything like that or ... by the dollar general Larry the nation and the ad council\nThis week tops the beast or easing\nFears like you've been watching on TV this week season is underway the CBS Drama\nSEAL Team starring in David ... is the premiere episode fracture is it number five next number four is the printed done the Tucker clan in Modern Family now when it's ten seeds and\nIt's the Philadelphia Story on the latest episode of NBC's this has asked which comes in third place\nThen number two marriages gray and team are faced with life and death decisions daily on Grey's Anatomy and finally it's a fight for humanity salvation on American horror story apocalypse the could it be said an episode is your number one TV screen\nThat says we stop TV stream side I our radio purchase\nOf select mattresses that's Casper dot com ...

de stigmatize is paranormal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the death bed visions in your thoughts about that though you\nExtremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who's dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned hold this fellow until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWas dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that I brings up another subject which is sometimes people receive messages and dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the ...\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nNews there was a movie about a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other government to leaders\nTo to assassinate them and you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and there were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that they mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know a lousy dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although\nWe don't really know and that and how how would we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable\nMhm [noise] yeah I was also talking about messages in dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um wasn't a pre cognitive gene was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up\nThis is the message I got I I just saw these where it said this is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition above the ides of march\n[noise] that's right in fact she dreamt the night before he was killed she'd been that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate he ignored who please also with ... told Julius Caesar the where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he northern ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their promotions do maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should go after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know that said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregard things which could be dismissed that superstition\nThere's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was the horse racing though yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spin on something else some loss\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming at you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people are they don't believe\nThey don't believe that and also they were afraid of getting into something which appears irrational\nTell me a little bit about blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because\nThere have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth who have another body experience during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up to ... to tell the doctors and nurses\nAre what they saw and what they heard while they were out of their bodies there was one patient who was blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the pattern on his doctors pie and of course the doctor was astounded\nThere was another case of a blind patients who left his body during surgery I think no he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body and he was observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put his dentures and he wanted his teeth\nRight you have you\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well when I was out of my body I saw you put them in that we're over there and she open that door and sure enough there\nThey were they were well yeah it works it would that work yeah\nWhat what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual components life I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related you see I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual\nI mean there are certain words that are used to describe these experiences are these phenomena some people call them ... some people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous or mystical are mysterious Israel different words are being used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal events can have a spiritual\nComponent yeah but I'm not saying every paranormal event but some do of course it depends on the person who's having the experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\nOh definitely I think it improves the quality of life for people to feel like there is something more\nAre out there that we don't have to live our routine nine to five eight and a day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\n...

in fact it had happened and if a psychologist that did it in the ... where he had a group of eight people including himself and he had each one of them go to a different emergency room had different

that they were misdiagnosed as it's panic they're admitted to the war they were given medication they didn't take medication and once they got the where the patient me that they were faking so they were able to fool the doctors but they were unable to fool the other patients\nPatients knew how did they know\nWell because these people were otherwise normal the facts and the fact that they had they were hearing voices and came to their parents their behavior the conversation the way they were thinking the way they presented themselves everything else about them is completely normal for that

into the paranormal what psychic abilities\nSaint was that called Michael\nNo wasn't that one it was something else but I was a great movie but so you think though that some kind of injury to the brain could augment your psychic abilities\nYes it it could I could open you lived in different dimensions because I've I've heard of cases I Know of of people who have had near death experiences and then when they recovered they become psychic and they're able to see or read the new people to\nKnow predict the future and they have all kinds of psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nHi uh I like their practices 'cause uh I'm a skeptical person and uh\nI've got degrees or ... degrees ... and I talked to physics engineering for years so I'm kind of a you know that kinda gosh you're\nHowever uh I had a dream that seemed to come true uh many years ago when I was in my thirties and a ... as offended and says a ... that's disturbing and there are fewer space and time\nUh right now doesn't seem to allow information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year to a record my dreams and his first I tried a member of the seventies the portable\nTape recorders are kind of clunky mhm and uh and to record you'd have to ... to ... I think like recording play at the same time right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning and trying to hit the button so I went back and just writing things down on paper\nAnd of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured that method for that that took me some of those were reliable and one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual ally ... and then I decided but what happened later in the ... thing\nAnd that was as a as a I was in a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him and comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh I one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside I'm kind of a format outside I you know couldn't figure out the map\nBut anyway he says I'm a dairy I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is\nAnd I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of Vermont I said I Do too\nAnd so uh yeah let's go look for it and integrating rafter walk up a rock side but some kind of structure outside of a couple of steps and then there's another walkway going both ways more cable and then I Would of apple and just like many level and finally I said oh look a there the bathroom down there\nAnd so I'm walking ahead of them and the and the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual and what it was is in men's room have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're going to vote and then they have you're All right\nSomeone had in Iran all gun number two\nI read it in other words [laughter] so I stopped in my tracks and and he ran in can beat this fellow in my dream and he said what are you doing and I said oh\nAh somebody just as something really awful and here and they said what in Haiti then and now at that point I had a lot of fun\nGet a college were recruited all over the middle east and uh and and the average I'm not a Japan I'm On my right\nAnd so I said well you know maybe for another culture who didn't know that would apply to go the bathroom and you know okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought

DSM am El Paso\n[noise]\nIn the news radio I'm Liz Warner turkey is reportedly preparing to free and American pastor\nSoon NBC News site senior administration officials are saying the White House expects Andrew Brunson to be released in the coming days after a secret deal was reached details will be agreement remain unclear but sources familiar with the negotiations say it includes the U.S using economic pressure on Ankara\nVery welcome back to close to grocery done with us we'll get to your calls as well very over the can you predict or five years from now\n[noise] yes you know we can predict out I mean I was predicting this you know\nThe trouble in the economy started in two thousand eight back in the late eighties I'm just from the baby boom generation when they were predictably spent and when they would stop spending ... what we see is it the worst of this downturn in what we call the winter season it started in two thousand\n... probably about two thousand twenty two for stocks uh two thousand twenty three for the economy will be the worst and and probably real estate out there maybe a little longer real estate takes longer to crash and longer to come back\nAnd then we'll start to see them again from about twenty two twenty three all the way in two thousand thirty six that'll be the next global the difference is George\nIs that it will be concentrated as it has been before but even more so in Asia and especially in India and Southeast Asia most developed countries a lot of Europe Japan and East Asia have continued bad demographics in the United states is kind of the best house in the neighborhood\nWhere our demographics or we have a strong millennial generation but not as strong as they should be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and we're\nThe strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst already has been in commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nWe're so far oil and iron ore eighty percent there's going to be another big commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between now and two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only the\nOrange or does it real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when they die they are literally permanent shelters if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people that the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sectors so in our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to ... dot com and that's going to be has to be in the next year\nThat that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nEvery what happens if we ever regional war more what's that going to do the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting and people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farming commodity products to you know of transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and\nUh the great depression was followed by World War two the disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there's a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we've this trade war and we said this in his ear all our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's gonna be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\nThat they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to get in too much because they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but there's certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nNot sure let's go to Peter in ... Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and that's what happened in the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that's our money they're pledging\nThey also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent so so there are there risks to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAll of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick\nAnd then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a ... city tour in Australia is the big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits\nAnd we're going to vote them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that have\nHave it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen and people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens and and and and the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nAnd that stuff we go the keys in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr debt I Want to ask about Puerto Rico which was already Seventy three billion

Empire State and secondly California which is not friendly to business when people bleed state they insist on taking their\nShort sighted left wing politics with them they go to places like Texas

civil war and us conservatives are ready to fight and some of what you're saying makes sense but it's much more dire than they were going to beat each other's throats\nAnd a starting with that Puerto Rican example a and I'm going to say this bluntly if I can too many Hispanics like black Americans vote democratic they will not give Republicans and conservatives the chance and and the same way that all all of these urban areas\nHave been struck dumb because of liberal\nDemocratic policies uh we're having them going to say this bluntly the non white people blacks and Hispanics they vote herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nLike hey hey let let let me are real quickly you're right about the
