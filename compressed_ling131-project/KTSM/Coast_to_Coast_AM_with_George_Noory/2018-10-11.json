day I'm wonder what else there has to do to avoid this disease what's happening to you what do you deal essential\nTremors or not genetic or they're or they're actually caused by a nutritional deficiencies in and of course um\nAnd you get them they can be called or things like Parkinson's disease or the ... and of course in parking Aziz MS Lou Gehrig's disease hunting is these are all kinds of the same diseases different parts of the brain or randomly\nOr more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors where there was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or essential tremors an matter billionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats no oil so blues no sugar and then you take one healthy brain and heart attack or a hundred pounds of body weight one healthy brain and heart back for a hundred pounds of body weight\nI'm taking photos everything twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight then you throw in the distrust castles capital D like David ... three of those twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight the ultimate nice and plus a to those twice a day for a hundred pounds of body weight that will be to ... a month or the ultimate nice and plus or a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd then I Need you to eat uh let's see here what do you weigh\nA hundred and Seventy two Seventy two pounds I have eaten nine eggs today [noise] and they can be ... scrambled butter I Do want to eat a stick of butter day and they help me understand that we do have a CD called\nA stick of butter day keeps the doctor away a stick of butter day keeps the doctor away heritage and listen to that CD many many times and you're just shake your head and say well there was my problem you've been listening and doctors and staying away from cholesterol ... as your best friend\nWhen reading that butter you want to be eating dairy products that has to have a high fat dairy is a big study with a hundred and twenty thousand people would look at Central tremors and Parkinson's disease\nAnd they found that they had a deficiency of dairy fat they were eating zero fat yogurt ... drinking skim milk or non dairy coffee creamer is indeed the whole cream a day a stick of butter day um and you drink whole milk\nYou remember my breakfast ... remember my breakfast berries strawberries blueberries blackberries brass burns and some whipped cream\nThere you go with whipped cream is the best part [laughter]\nReally yeah because that's what your brain requires maintained so people don't realize that George Seventy five percent of all ... raised brain including human beings and porpoises mistakes in Wales and looming goes and giraffes overt rate Seventy five percent of the brain wages the white mayor of the brain which is a hundred percent cholesterol you\nNeed that that okay to censor the egg\nEgg yolks come in days are so important um and so I'm all these things the essential tremors go away Parkinson's goes away Huntington goes away these are not genetic things or even if everybody in your family's gone they're all eating the same way cooking in the same way of living in the same place\nOff the Boise idaho we go Hasan's with us let's get your question in he's in go ahead\n[noise] uh yeah George ... first time caller but I've been listening to you for like twenty three year old thank you yeah love you\nLove

for it at all\nUm his lymph nodes just drained anywhere in the body and the heat swelled up like a balloon and just a leaking out of his pours\nI'm there to make matters worse about a year later he was diagnosed with lung cancer stage for which he's gone into remission through a radiation sure which you how old way I'm the only a few\nMoments here how much does he way\nNo how how much is the way he's white and\nNow he's about three hundred and he's a little over six feet tall and normally about two hundred okay\nSo three hundred pounds\nAre easier to all the bad food the fried foods depresses me the ... and we brought around oats\nA he needs to take three healthy brain and heart pastor month three healthy ran a heart after months and because he has a history of this cancer and certainly get him\nAs the um liquid I'm a must be nine a grape seed extract from our nature's Pearl division I want him to have three doses a day that will be it does represent and then it was kind of like a a

[noise]\n\n\nThan\nWalking back to coast to coast limbic Tiger Woods Lin is one of the central voices in the new consciousness movement she's the author of several great books including the field and the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be\nBack you two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we just had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when the several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas or they could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens at work so they\nDefinitely does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep the uh the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just skirted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we've run about thick piece intention experiments trying to lower violence\nUm last September we ran a six day experiment to lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a a a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri ...\nAnd we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor at statistics look at this from the University of California\nAnd she saw that crime went up in St Louis has a home property crime went up in St Louis as a home property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent for before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so that's going on here\nAnd what do you think this is what a people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the field but what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our phone everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now you know I'm thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make it grow faster to purify water\nHealing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of the thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effect\nDecided to walk into a trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know pharmaceutical drug\nHas is good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power to change things\nNow maybe he'll thing the ... been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\nYeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis\nAnd then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I live in the u._k. and we had nine different screens with the studio I can be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras and nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries I was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east\nAnd also a very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other\nAnd I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd what was amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know I'm just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know ... and all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does added to play ... in the if you're a beach in positive will that generally work better than someone who goes into these ... as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individuals for instance we did an intention once for a kid call Luke who is Fifteen Years old who tried to commit suicide is through self off of forty foot structure after his he broke up\nWith this for a serious girlfriend and he'd broken everything he had brain damage she had\nA you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping notes and careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLuca better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nAt work for him and he didn't believe a word of it\n... with these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nI get a team of scientists George I now I work with a lot ... Gary Schwartz at the University of of Arizona the noted psychologist\nAnd a Jessica ... who is a very well known professors statistics and has been doing working consciousness research\nI worked with the late ... I worked with people from from Penn State university water expert um I worked with um people from uh uh I'm from Princeton University you know just really prestigious universities\nSo we'll get an all kick around ideas with them and see what's measurable\nAnd then the team will talk about well how are we going to measure this and how to set it up and some of them you know we do it in a laboratory like with Dr Schwartz we did some seed experiments where we had four sets the seeds\nAnd we sent intention to one set of seeds and then the scientist didn't know which ones were sending intention to so we had you know real scientific type of experiment and they planted the seeds and carefully measured them so it's all done with the scientific protocol that they really helped me set up because they're the scientists\nAnd then I just invite my readers all over the globe and we've had people from a hundred and fifty countries participate\nOr I'm an audience if I'm speaking in front of a large group to to do the intention and I'll be in and out of my\nUh Internet site or YouTube or own Web TV or radio you and I did one together and um and then we calculate that we wait a while and we calculate the results\nAnd the reason we wait a while is safe for the peace experiments if\nYou just do it a week after well could you know violence could go down but if you look at what's gone on for a couple of years before and then look for about six months afterwards if you have bucked the trend then it starts to get pretty interesting\nAnd do you know losing the title of your new book the power of each has to do with the number of people you put in the group the test why ... why not three Fifteen\n[laughter] will the path of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted\nTo know what happens if we put people in groups of\nYou know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen which is the first no hitter in the history of the world series even better there was a perfect game that is there were no runs no heads and no errors and\nNo better reach for the largest performance angered is dean third string went against their cross down rivals the Brooklyn Dodgers\nThis weekend Nineteen Ninety two Eighteen year old Michele nap is watching television and her parents living room ...

just look it's not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power of what are they doing\nWill we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis one makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its identical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this the ... largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system workers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nBut one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas nerve it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is that hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we're caring for babies\nAnd then the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why not Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending love to be Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas nerve also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intention experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be that would be an interesting for\n[laughter] will you know we're doing one this at this Sunday I'm doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're gonna do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nUm we're we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a\nWoman mirror affect me was the biggest piece of this George because\nYou know we weren't just seeing affects among the receivers of stuff and the receivers of the big intention experiments you know the outcome of the biggest change all that was amazing to me was what happened to the participants in these intention experiments\nSo when we started doing these peace experiments I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly ah I asked them how it was for them and I was getting answers back like this\nUm I felt like I was part of a higher network you know my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beam in Star Trek remember these are people who are participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy and the extraordinary emotion\nBut more interestingly is after they participated in a piece experiment their lives became more peaceful\nThey were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners they were getting along better with their bosses in their co workers\nThey were ... and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nSo that to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiments we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lives were more peaceful\nSo in a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment\nNot the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to the people it changes their lives being part of it\nWhen we're going to come back in the moment and take phone calls I've still got a few more questions for

production Dutch I got Kevin dumb ever to blur capital with me today so watch asking Kevin how are ya\nGreat George thanks yeah in two thousand and two shores four dollars announced near it cost to production we predicted short rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time she was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nAnd why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible though\nShore in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels they're just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces at over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not\nAnd doing it because they expect the price to go\nDown you know I guess not but consumer reach higher than a hundred dollars announce\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach us all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\nRoom when that happened\nOver the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential and silver right now\nGiven our listeners are passionate about anything that you can send out the listener

had another woman who is developing arthritis in their hands\nAnd bite she did the intentions of the week for other people week after week after week and her arthritis completely cleared\nJust like that just like that\nThat's the correct we just went the grade you know well by the way we did have that caller right before the break wanted to know what to do about his pain remember that\nYeah um I

slash for them and just come on the forum and set up a group or a virtual group or joining existing group in their time zone but I think he should do a power the group\nUm and we have a lot of great
