O. two which is a greenhouse gas and that would warm the planet even more\nSo much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this was much Clinton freshwater in most places there is a north of\nMel oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um [noise] but\nThe waters on Mars it's frozen and all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to slow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain\nAnd once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around\nNow if we were using that kind of plant\nWe have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis uh it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to breed them all\nBut if we're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we could do genetic engineering of plants to make them instead of one percent deficient five percent efficient\nAnd in which case this thing could happen much much faster and um so I think Mars is going to be Tara formed within two hundred years and my\nGuess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about and who's going to do a thorough what country the Martians or\nThey're going to do with themselves no when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program which I mean they watch us to the ... are you assess and they bring us back\nA well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nBut I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well here's the thing I'm machine in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia gonna both face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my I guess the Chinese though because they see the benefit of of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they\nMoved away from command economy um but Russia issue there is not allowing a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government [noise]\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country and the the and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this at will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up now for ... zone or ... ... email newsletter today it goes to goes to um dot com\n\n\n\n\nWho says you're and now look back at\nThis week in history this week in Nineteen oh one sixty three year old schoolteacher named any medicine Taylor becomes the first person to take the plunge over Niagara Falls in a barrel was helping to assistance Taylor strapped herself into a letter harnessed inside an old wouldn't heckle barrel five feet high and three feet in diameter\nKnocked violently from side to side by the Rapids in them propelled over the edge of horseshoe falls Taylor reached the short lived around twenty minutes after her journey began\nAfter a brief flurry of photo ops who speaking engagements Taylor's fame\nCooled and she was unable to make the fortune for which she had hopes this week in Nineteen thirty one eight months ahead of schedule New York governor Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the George Washington bridge over the Hudson River four thousand seven hundred and sixty foot long suspension bridge the longest in the world that the time connected Fort Lee New Jersey with Washington Heights in New York City\nOne year later it carry five million cars from New York to New Jersey and back again\nThis weekend Nineteen sixty two in a televised speech of extraordinary gravity president John F.

illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that a ... for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nAll us we hire them to do that well yeah well the\n... states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but it\nIs a a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that I mean ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then\nGee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well [noise]\nUm [noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um\nYou know once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into a and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're we're going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure will um now that there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is a pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets [noise]\nBut um if we could create air breathing proposed and that can operate at those speeds\nUh they launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen it's not to feel if you can get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows or the you know the next new kid on the block me a a you know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion too are but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um we could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm\nFinished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it sounds like what are we supposed to talk about the office after I listen\nTo your show like\nAnyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the ... and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering I'm going to get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade like America deal like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\nOK\nStill there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right ah well here's the thing\nUm [noise]\nThere there is an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we get to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we\nCreated much more and I would not undo the settlement of America but on Mars there are new Indians there are no\nBuys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks ah nobody'd be picketing Columbus Day parade today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little a futuristic at this point\nUh I think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims\nOn asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because of mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims that people could get a exploration missions finance mine asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nEach year farmers can help local students my

coast to coast George story with you and our guest Brandon ... with us branded as a political therapist author\nParis psychologist residing in the north eastern section of Ohio\nHe has a graduate degree in political constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland was research at the University of other than birds centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the dos studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to George I'm excited to\nI got shot at a clinical therapist get involved and go studies\n[laughter] well actually within a psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist ... actually\nActually got a day job and then I studied the pair of psychology and goes part of thing\nWell that something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah yeah I've spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter] how'd you do not very well [laughter]\nThat's good well let's see they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight which was that was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just social studies for what he was an overview of what you been doing random\n[noise] well um\nYou know I uh I have a degree in psychology or when I was at the University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and ghostly encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with the go studies and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um it's no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explain and goes to my encounters\nOr oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as hallucinations interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality\nTelevision shows to provide insight into these life altering experiences so you know there's millions of people out there including myself we were looking for things are books with more than just go stories tales of locations are outdated views\nUm and that's when I wrote the book and I just thought you know I combine real life ghost encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights and the cause of these throwing encounters um it's the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than face or belief or\nEven experience and you know and you know these ghosts I've been taking our interests for millions of years\nAnd it's and I think we're at the point where there's becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over\nYou know there are several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters um you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these new theories\nAre and that's where I came out with the book so you know I really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the right the the greatest or the latest research in a ghostly encounters with a book well\nThen you bring a do some real science to the picture you know I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean the great thing is is out\nThere you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology a physicist a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and how electricity affects us and um and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just\nYou know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article what kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on but I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding it\nWouldn't have you concluded today about what the grossly experience might be for real big into their imagination what do you think so\nI actually think a majority of the ghost encountered that that are out there I Believe are there's some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to ghostly encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think the majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them what do they help\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more by ... view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um telepathy extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ghostly counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are\nComing in or being real sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment and other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a a tele path distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA so I really think that um people's telepathy a is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way and count\nHow important than the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a\nCatalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that you know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm a death\nTwenty five years after his

hold crypto currency inside their IRAs well\nAre you suggesting people have a bitcoin ... gold or silver IRA\nNot at all we give investors the option don't both in their IRA now explain that force when I first heard about bitcoin treated for pennies in fact there's an incredible story about how\nOne guy by two pizzas with ten thousand bitcoins that were worth about twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and what stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWhile I'm not quite pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight bitcoin is a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin is good coined or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nWe do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin any of our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black men IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit blocked meant I R E dot com\nSo you can have aspirations of in places where there is no tragedy there's nothing like that there's no Spanish soldiers there is no civil war soldiers but you could still have these types of operations\nAnd I think that's really one of the most fascinating things that I go over in the book because a lot of people have these experiences and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part you know I've got to ask I Believe you during the show from near the man's school reform matory\nYep we sure did and every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love\nStory was sure okay my mother and full blooded Cherokee of call been quite a few times a following runoff but anyway ah my father died\nAnd three months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out the you know to to kids\nAnd just before they liked she woke up my father was there\nYou came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mumps it up you have your kissed her and said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful and the strongest power of everything is love and it was going to share that\nWith sweet mhm\nSo these sometimes these stories are just emotional as well or if they do\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part it in in my in the ... and the accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things and like we talked about before it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says that sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes goes scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx side deals going hey George how are you know\nGood I'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe really a story about a full up or religion or seen um [noise]\nYeah the um the question is do you think that there is a subliminal under channel of communication going on between the go see a permission and the recipient of the ghost experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's this supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly upper mission appearing\nAnd I had a full upper recent experience or after my brother passed away um I was ... I was having writer's block on his song and I've really destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise]\nUm he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot of my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall now um can you maybe elaborate\nOn what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was he a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away\nA ... a ... before you have the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nAll right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question will quick so I I think it's kind of similar to that\nWell we talked about earlier you know with a husband thing his wife and then the wife got a check on the bench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThis is an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with your song those types of things she's giving you the motivation because that's something you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information it's visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like there's one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog in the water injured and\nYou can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they're kind of reading each other's emotions and then he wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study at Barnes and noble a it's an Amazon dot com if you like listening to books on radio or your car you can get it at audible as well so basically anywhere you can find books you can pick up\nSuper Brandon thank you love talking to you for Dan belonged to Tom Dan Hynes or Lisa lion elect Sloan who had shown a lot of shore Stephanie Smith Chris borough student but all in Georgia now I'm George Norris somewhere out there on coast to coast am will she want our next edition until then be safer [noise]\nJust use the October twenty third what's new today on the free I her radiolab\nSpicy ... steel tracks with labor in spite of we've got the ... everyone's talking about like the ... the ... the Joe Rogan experience and make sure you voted\nThe first ever I her radio broadcast awards to show your support for your fast food now and I guess the wars that guy\nEither were able to the book [noise] ... me [noise] these are some of the Internet most loved with millions of\nYouTube views cheers Instagram my phone number\n... ... what all these amazing ... time in common [noise]\nTheir stories started in ... ... or you're a dump dog today visit the shelter pet project work on the show or a dump from\nTrending blue the keyboard well [laughter] that's entirely up to you\nShow cutthroat you can hear more about the animals in the photos and keyboard [noise] these dying\nStewardess during adopt a shoulder rescued today in your perfect pet is just a click away shelter pet project on\nPublic service announcements drunk to by Madison the humane society of the United states and the echo [noise]\nIt's an open channel I guess just try to keep channels opened we welcome open minded individual scientists to keep in mind\nAll issues with open arms I think we need to have always ... hoping conversations and when you open the I charge radio with us when old new world\nYou are listening to him loose instead of just open the border with the same time check everyone is\nHolding the games [laughter] downloaded the store poor side Jay Z assume radio dot com [noise]\nNews radio six Ninety Days paint GSM am El Paso\n[noise]\nNBC News radio and Brian\n...

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity or if you're going to be a first class power\nMuch right now you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean you know a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... ... ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was in the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact of the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they try to launch a weapon or something like that\n[noise] well um I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or\nThe um [noise] you know I'm\nAll of us who you hire them to do that\nWell yeah well the states that one weapons okay I mean because what after all is a state but\nIt is a a military force that exists well a presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but no I I don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh\nYou know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich ticket to go to Mars well um\nIt's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um\nAnd also I think that um you know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go\nAnd um\nYou know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of propulsion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion\nNow earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nA bake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not feel if you could get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\nYou know the next new kid on the block me a ... you know knocking on mosque office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion to orbit\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel [noise] um [noise]\nWell um\nWe could I mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high

American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead or a okay All right ah well here's the thing um [noise] there there\nIs an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial\nLife there is really a gone off the deep end okay because uh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were\nPeople right and you can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature\nWild nature on America was wrong this you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe that while we get destroy some things

claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nUh being launched a ... in the very near
