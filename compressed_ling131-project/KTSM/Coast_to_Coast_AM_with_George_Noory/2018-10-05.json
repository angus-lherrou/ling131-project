their adult life\nIt's kind of an ... thing that they can go into with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in

I'm\nSure right although micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about near death experiences of all the other side what to do what can you conclude at this point well\nI Know that culture takes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste\nA than that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody\nMet and if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intention is very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across any doing the still baffles you we're on [laughter]\nEvery day more and more [laughter]\nI think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about what these different cultures\nExpect from the world and you know being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the ... are in Ecuador and you know they really do believe that at night they're consciousness leaves the body when they're dreaming and that\nEach year farmers can help local students by endorsing them for Fifteen hundred dollar grow ag leaders scholarship scholarship allow students to pursue their dream to studying and agriculture related field each year program provides more than a half million dollars to students enroll in and trade school\nAnd at two and four year colleges and universities\nFields are eligible including farming education a grimy engineering mathematics data science communication and many more I encourage high school seniors and college students to apply today by visiting grow at leaders dot com I could say membership is not required\nBy our radio fantasy sports news updates\nIn the NFL is Adam ... is expected slave Thursday night against the gold\nAnd head coach of the Atlanta Falcons then when did come from a devolved or Freeman will play we five against the dealers Colorado\nRockies up the Milwaukee Brewers Antonio sends a tele is on them out for the ... the Milwaukee Brewers then opened her Brenda Moore drew up to the mound in Los Angeles and led to open my old the ... the mounting jewelry you law posed implore the Dodgers\nCling ... game number two\nFor the Los Angeles Dodgers and pull the Braves it'll be ...\nBench as on friday we get Cleveland I use in Colorado apple walking game to New York or Boston per game on and Atlanta Los Angeles for being number two I'll be and now the audience driver and this has been your fantasy sports radio network news update\nFantasy sports radio network keyboard granted the on your heart radio out [noise]\nYou know be hard radio we can sport time capsule\nSports fans a dandy west and I'm here to take you back on a journey to this week in sports history started way back in Nineteen oh three were the first World Series begins play\nThe Boston Americans beat the Pittsburgh Pirates\nFive games to three and a best of nine theory why\nThis week in Nineteen thirty two it was Babe Ruth legendary call three points to center field before ... into the Wrigley\nField bleachers in the beginning it was game three of the world series and the Yankees won stepping up by this week in Nineteen fifty one third baseman Bobby Thompson hits a one out three run home run on the bottom of the ninth inning to win the national tennis for the New York giants Thompson's Homer wrapped\nUp in an amazing come from behind run to the giants the giants went on to lose the series of the Yankees\nFor Thompson's miraculous home run remains one of the most memorable moments in sports history referred to as the shot heard round the world\nThis week in Nineteen eighty Larry Holmes retains his W.

on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he\nSaid you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to find\n'em but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important\nTo live a good life and to be a good citizen I'm to be loving inclined toward other people than it was to spend a lot

this question of what one shift\nPeople's mind about that question and is it the data is it the fact that in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad

those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please which rule but employees with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWell I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them\nAnd yet they're the most important thing that Shapes Our experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt Shapes Our experiences and so we can't see those things that lie outside of our expectations\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those part of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them and I think that that is a remarkable\nUh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of it functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now where are we placing our attention that then offers that's the point of liberation and to expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness Lou ... outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in for us because\nEvery ... is filled with light and with that intention to a man of his life and so I I Do believe that consciousness is something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the consciousness\nOr the signal or the signal exact it keeps coming ... exactly will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual
