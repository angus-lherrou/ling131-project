our expert on the Internet luring Weinstein who will of course his disclaimer before we get going go ahead Lauren\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so now what is Google Plus for ... is a Google\nA social networking platform as it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter is in the Google ... that I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\n... if you're going to be missed by millions of people you know there's this story that's been going on for ages oh with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus and throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy sponsored posts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book so there was no separate\nIncome stream coming from it in the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have sponsored post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything\nAnd they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people to kind of regret it given what's going on\nBut sizes everything with social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't do they found that in a during a if I understand that during their on auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it had ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical vulnerability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school\nAnd the kinds of information that were that were um theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why stir things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's why it's her petition\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... it convenient a kind of a rationale for setting into motion to fund the setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly of the first\nPlace um and uh it would have been a lot better all around if they had in the meantime all of us who've been using Google Plus all these\nYears of trying to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I'll mention that there the Google commercial version of Google Plus which operates further Gees we the the the business systems where you pay about five bucks a month for per head\nUsing us that's going to continue so Google Plus we'll be continuing commercially uh and then we'll just have to see what happens competing with Facebook probably a ... and facebooks turf with probably not a good idea in the first place\nThat's a time at you're right it it seemed at the time\nThat it seems like a logical thing to do you know you don't want to miss out but as we've seen the way Facebook did it to to have that norm as growth has now trip them up and a lot of serious ways to so there's positives and negatives to all these\nAnd one quick question I hear snapped jabs going broke where do you hear\nA apparently Snapchat having all kinds of all kinds of problems um I guess their stock has been a walloped\nYeah that's a very well uh their their founder has been sending out there you know kind of messages to the troops the kind of ... tried to cheer them up [noise] uh it it it appears that some pretty serious mistakes were made

about is working in the upside down thinking\nMarch ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell the ... cycle couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect suggesting that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire anchor people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test\nAnd it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chose videotapes of various anchor people and ... the ones that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nOr with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in present cement experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no cycle can nieces is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRight again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain it comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run a Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies\nAnd he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is this ability for the mind that\nMatter the classic study uses random number generators these machines that spit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty percent heroes and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does is asked people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room so they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more once in a zero\nAgain what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect where it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one they did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic\nAnd in people do people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton study where these machines the random number generators\nOr set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're generating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround event that we know are produced heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant ... basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events what do we find that\nThere was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers before the event that before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nOr a yellow her you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for psycho couldn't he says he had the ability to use a ... keys and everything else with his mind now there are some who say dollars trickery its magic\nBut the if you believe that he had that ability he did some incredible things and uh\nAnd it'd be taught can cycle can ... be taught\n[noise] [noise] well I've heard of a boon bending party which sounds ridiculous but uh I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind and ways to to affect matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending metal for example and early ... is an example where many credible people have suggested that what he can do is real including um Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said in a two thousand Fifteen television interview that he saw Keller than\nThere are many people who have suggested that this is real I'm a side note on your a gallery very interesting I mentioned the CIA documents earlier\nThere's another document that I clued in my book an end to upside down thinking that talks about Ehlers abilities but not in the context of spoons pending it's in the context of remote viewing mhm abilities and what they say and this is a direct quote from a classified document\nWhere he was he was put under very I mean they were watching it closely what the documents that is as a result of Keller success in this experimental period we consider that he has demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability and convincing and unambiguous manner\nSo you know there has been a lot of debate about him but these documents suggest that studies were run and he was able to perform which I think should open up to the possibility that maybe he was able to do things using his mind that down totally crazy\nMark would you give up your

hour\nShows that like that everybody seems to see going into that tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call listen\nI'm Glad you brought up short this is a really really important one because\nIf there is some truth in what you are experiencing beyond the nation perhaps it get a window into a reality that we typically do arise I I think we should explore this went further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence can eat and most alley in evidence are\nCardiac arrest studies that gross ... cardiac arrest studies that this is where people out there in our ... there was an experimenter it's talk to them soon\nAfter they're able to you soon after they've had the experience rather than people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nThat either cardiologist for Apple doctor and and mumble and party out from Stony Brook either one I guess you're looking at this and what they're finding that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\n'em back right near death experience and why is that in cardiac arrest here at the logical trauma in many cases the person that's clinically dead we know that when I stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the rain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have the experience that are so and as I mentioned earlier\nSometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is from Dr Sam party up in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patients in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the defender later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because of the times were being stamped and we know when the defendant later went off and it made it very distinctive sound\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere they've been cases as well we're somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body they see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance\nTalking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles their mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experienced and memories\nAre but what I've found is that there are very credible scientists that are looking at this for example the University of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWho's looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you described where they couldn't have known about things through a normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMark who you are on six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that the area\nYou can't see those radio signals but they're out there is that a little bit ... dishes like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see what they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us that are existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible drama on this topic\nYou've learned a lot haven't you [laughter]\nI have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid in Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist Anna materialist\nHowever I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think there is this phenomena going on I just think regarding and the ease and uh where where the mind I Would use the word mind not sold but mine are conscious just goes\nUh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not heaven or hell in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil\nI Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nSenior Larry to you know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications explains psychiatric medications medications for either anxiety or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs clouded than Xanax or at antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\nBack chemically the brain\nAnd therefore they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical you the brain to these medications or even aspirin or Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches\nGoing back to psych made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mine that's my first part my second part\nOf the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is The Mind's a dusting that show it here's my question for you it doesn't show that\nIf the mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the minus connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do addressed in the book and I've thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident and then has cognitive impairments we know there's a correlation\nWhat I argue and and some others argue this as well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Bernardo Castro when when I mentioned in my book [noise]\nImagine you have a fire lots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire\nMore firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship\nBut the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain and a bit of a different way with the brain is highly related to consciousness damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain and conscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book and I know about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence\nFor it we we've had some incredible stories to people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just does remarkable when they're checked out\nThere's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life\nYes and in some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from one existence to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique insulin California with us I'm Monique

ignore this cannot ignore this going all the way back he your your guest mentioned William James\nOkay all that whole period when all of this a lot of his early early research started\nInto shall we say ... ... ... and other other sorts of things and I I I mean I've never seen a U.S I've never seen what I could call a UFO the night sky and I've lived in places where the night sky was glorious\nI

it's a it's they're reading something but to the to the to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here no there's no question that if science skin see the things Steven just said we're on our way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need to study these phenomenon much more to understand the nuances of how it all works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo parts\nIt's really an academic institution even talk about these things I've talked to scientists who say that it's a academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and the evidence in one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation so that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening mhm\n[noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field\nThat has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the physics community as being real but it's totally counter intuitive\nThere's a phenomenon known as entanglements\nAnd the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter that are physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness now ... Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the faster than anything a travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat there are things in the ... of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced the notion of interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that that has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and into upside down thinking\nThat you're George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K G.

Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with Maureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practice studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years more and has been with the New England ghost project since two thousand one and there's a company the group on ...\nThe one the hungry investigations here she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to the point of Fifteen Years old old a shepherd for you yes\nUh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter]\nTell me about Lori Cabot the official which of sumo\n[noise] you know\nHe's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is um she's known as you know the high priest is in Salem and feel often\nWhen I was younger I see her walking around town you know dressed in her her garb and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents for a person and ... at\nThe time people welcome are rude open arms you did they go oh my God user which\nYeah that's a great question she you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the\nTown in Salem not necessarily [laughter] so it always seemed to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right\nFor the type of these and then it's you know go to Salem um so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a few generations psyche trench medium that means we're talking about ... back to your family your sibs ability what year did to start with\nNo my um\n[noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just never really wanted to I don't know if she didn't want to scare me she just you know my poor father though he thought just those girls insane\nUm but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirit that I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by um and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she's normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved but say in a matter of physical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was with talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you know what Marlene\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them from bleeding and\nDo readings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family that was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her um\nBut my great grand right grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town um so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history is who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever pass dome stories from one to the other than you could ...\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had path and uh she was maybe maybe five years before\nShe passed and it's interesting 'cause she you have a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy um and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true self she was very unique because that's what she said so\nThat the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nNow you've been with the New England the ghost project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well rounded do much better than me to tell the story but he's started this story\nAfter on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um [noise] you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing it on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus\nOn but it's a team of individual that you know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for the things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nSee one look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team\nUm that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just off the wall when you go to their house just losing it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nYou know show [laughter] sure was birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says\nWe've done more than a hundred investigation is\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise] um so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on um if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well\nThere's good reason why you don't see it [noise] um so if you say how many people I'd say a good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street\nYou'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain and their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be or be a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think there\nWell I think\nThere are varying degrees of what they could be right so our experience in my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their love when those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items and being tossed around the house\nUm there's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door to door closed\nIn her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stress from the stairs on you know\nThese out she'd have something go on in the oven and she'd go to put potatoes enroll them in foil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and yet they would fire would start in her of and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the flames itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many\nDifferent varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent nice um doesn't mean that you're going to have a spirit that a hundred percent you know wonderful and

and I'm a member of the Mets came in and she told her all about uh\nHow that used to come in the morning and sometimes they would find books in the middle of the floor and they couldn't understand why it happened so she finished their little spit on one side and then I get up and began to talk it suicide began to speak for the books from behind me came\nFlying la la la until the middle of Rome in

somebody back [laughter] tossing them at you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but there was just a ...\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr ... did\nNot find it but by the living room\nAnd I first book uh goes chronicles is more goes chronicles is is the second book on the series a marine and I did an investigation was daytime investigations jumped him and called me up and\nAsked me to check out his house so I get ... you know we went to his house and the places that massive would look like it's been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and ah so anyways uh they were pretty big ... uh in the they kinda got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of ... separated from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and uh so he wanted more rain and come back alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fair was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's\nIt's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you\nOr it varies on on on the particular case uh\nThe you know the the larger the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more of a piece of equipment a small case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you would need for instance if you have reports of a ... and\nBeing seen you might bring more video equipment are and like they're ... or\n... whatever that you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by\nAudio than you would bring more audio cut me so it it it varies a pool when you've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization Gomez realization\nUm actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations probably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that they weren't really well I was ... times in but more while I was just doing normal stuff yeah\nWork with a lot of White House history funds for them and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff\nAnd there are two separate occasions or one that I Do these goes to his cause I'm On the board of directors of a voice on top of a White House that we do these haunted toys and one time we were in this um [noise] it's ... uh\nLike an observation tower words the square\nBuilding with glass all around you and ... windows all around you can absolutely she you know three hundred and sixty degrees and there's one daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my view and I looked outside and I saw a woman a walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down the side of the world you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I don't want to repeat myself as she came in and they didn't want her to missing anything so I just thought and waited for like a circuit generally walk all the way to do it and I waited and waited\nAnd yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out there and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I get stuck my bill to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one and oddly enough\nThat the vocation is with the coast guard 'cause it's on the coast guard base\nOr the coast guard records and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um\nPerhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale was on a Sunday Morning after we get a public or goes typed on uh what Iowa light host and a good fit pool meal main we're in the White House ah keep his house it was under\nRenovation at that time we were sitting on the picnic table in the in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen my service dog all across the or the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their claws on the\nYeah yeah the the there was no it was about\nSo I jumped up meal you're into the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see that's just that's our dog she's has described it sure absolutely SARS clear as day and I describe that she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know run there was a White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to leave them leave the island or the dog wouldn't go so all with the White House keepers afterward took care of them till the dog actually died and I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses\nBecause she has a dog but that of that dog and I did see a picture of it looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it certainly saw it would appear to me at the upper Russia\nWhen it's still hangs around Ron stay with us we're going to bring

I don't know if you've seen that yet or\nNo I haven't seen that yeah it has a uh it's pretty that's your own it's our number is ... ... dot com but it's pretty cool sorry about that\nMaybe we can concentrate and bring nothing down from a four to nothing\nThat would be good [laughter]\nWe've been able to do some of that so when when when you go on your team when your team gets together how much research do you do before you go\nWell Maureen doesn't do any because half the time she doesn't even know where we're going to use\nYeah she was telling us that you you don't want to ah influence\nI I have to know something about it for instance if you're going especially if you go into a big location you have to know a where to concentrate you're you're investigating for instance if\nI'm there are a lot of noise is coming out of particular area you might want to concentrate your audio recordings here if\nIf for a A R a visual phenomena are in different locations you certainly want to uh you know put your cameras in there and and so you you kind of you have to have a little bit of it I Try to get too much into the details with tour of the crime is for\nLack of it or are you there to discover the ghost or to cleanse it what what did they ask for\nI Am not I am there for ... strictly investigate\nThat's a popular question 'cause and that was one of the things people will say when they read our first book was like oh you know\nYou know what were they doing you know they're not going to releasing spirits and you know those are things you hear from people but you know they love the book but the whole point is is as one and I've always talked about you know some of those parents have been there long before we have\nUm and we don't know why they're there right so we don't necessarily know if they want help to move on and that's one thing if they're there and they don't want to leave who are we to tell them to that they have to\nDoes the person who brings you when do they want the ghost outta there\nI always ask them you know what you want from us you know they basically uh you know what you expect from us and uh and I very at the cases on that if they're looking for someone who watch like a house Clinton's is something we're not going to do it though you know or are we from someone else\nUm but if they wanted to investigate this to understand what's going on and try to understand what's going on than will do that type of case\nAll right let's take some calls for both of you let's go to brandy and granted big California Welcome to the program I brandy\nHuh hey thank you for taking my call but\nUm yeah I had a question um I've had a really really rough year after year that's probably the worst year of my life\nAnd I'm Wondering if you are able to tell me if you see here next coming or being a lot better hopefully things starting to go more my way\nMaureen this would be for you that's for sure yes [laughter] yes it was\nUm okay so Brandi I did pull a couple of cards for you on and honestly one of the things that I see is a lot of emotional turmoil right so that you it seems like you're holding onto a lot of hurt\nThat have been happening around you right um and I obviously don't want to get too personal um but you know and the other kind of poll is you know this was last year now and things that have been happening is like a pressure right so because of all these things going around you it feels like your hands are tied and you're not able to move forward\nOn what I Would tell you is that\nFor you to get to a better place you really need to trust you need to let go of some of these things that are you know in your life that I hate to say it but even even if there is um like a health issue that is taking place it's a learning lesson right now for you\nUm and it's a time for you to grow and you have to be able to to trust that it's not going to be this way all the time and I know that might sound cliche but\nI'm pulling these cards around you and it tells me that you know you're really trying um but you're having a hard time you're like okay where do I begin to let this go on and you're doing a good job of trying to act the part I feel like you're going through your daily day routines are really trying to put on a mask but you're not feeling it is that correct or now\nA right [noise] yeah\nYeah okay right so it puts you think of it this way right so if you know I see that there's a healing hand that you have and I used to me you have to go to person it feels like a lot of people are the ones that come to you when they have an issue is that correct\n\nThat you tend to be the ear that people talk to like someone always there yeah yeah [laughter] okay so you need to know that you know\nYou have to have patience with yourself and your situation okay um how many is coming so know that you you are coming to a breakthrough it is going to get better but I think a lot of it is knowing it's going to get better you know you have to put yourself in a place that's like a catch twenty two right so you almost have to feel it\nFeel that strength inside of you again which you're kind of like well how do I get that back\nUm and a lot of it is balance right is finding a balancing your life is what you really need to do at this moment\nAlright thanks good luck brand new hope everything works out for you\nDuring this time do you do you find Ron Maureen the these investigations are more prevalent during the Halloween season or does it matter\n[laughter] [laughter]\nIt it doesn't matter but you know what even Ron I'm sure would agree is early on I mean a lot of people have that and they think while it's October Halloween teasing right we need to be out there\nUm and I'd say over the years that might have started when I joined the group that was more it was busier around that time of year but now I think Ron would say is probably busy constantly\nMaureen what do you think we gee boards\nFunny you bring that up um you know I think that they're a tool\nI don't think that's something to be afraid of them I just think it's the intention that you use when you're using that we'd be bored so if you're you know you're drinking you're using the ... then that's probably not a good idea um because you're not\nOpen and you're not protecting yourself and um we had a actually a case of a woman who had some issues by using a lead you board and I believe she lives on having a you know getting high at the time or whatever she was doing 'em and she invited the spirit end\nAnd her ... her whole life rather went into chaos her home burnt down a she pretty much lost everything\nAnd we were actually called in an investigation on a different home she lives in she was now losing that home um so I don't know what do you think about it wrong\nYou know a a a bite parish priest call in and asked me that same question what do you think of what we do boards\nI says I've got a collection of the the games [laughter] uh and uh I Do I have a collection of all different ones for use as most good PR whoa confess the kid is too [laughter]\nBut uh I go to I always say though if you're not

joined or music or their George I love all your news all the way from bluegrass dude sold to everything from the years you been playing your number one when it comes to that\nAll right my friend more to come so what what what is the definition Ron oh what a ghost becomes why does it become a ghost\nYou know it's the sixty four thousand dollar question Georgian\nEnvy honestly we really don't know exactly what a ghost is I mean ah when I first started doing this I used to work with a Franciscan monks and we had a cause a religious aspects of it\nAnd we come up with the feeling that maybe some of this is the the purgatory thing not like it's a punishment but rather\nIt's a place it's a temporal thing versus the and visit the thing so I mean that's just going on doing their time basically but that's I mean that's the only one theory there are many three she is the tragedy thing is one I always heard about\nIn Gettysburg was always supposed to be the most hard then that's why it's the most thing but\nThere are there are battles I mean Nagasaki and you I mean thousands of people will tell like that why are we seeing like almost goes from running around so there's got to be certain aspects of that we were unaware of or or have yet to determine and a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly\nFor sure we have our theories and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all kinds of evil [laughter]\nWell well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a you know spirit guide on right now the ghost to maybe\n... I guess it depends on what the definition of the ghost might be I mean if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or\nIs that there's some kind of entity your spirit or or one of your same\nThe number one I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes nuts somebody who is just passed away and they they come back to see how you're doing or let them know I'll let you know that there are okay I mean that happened to my mom my mom didn't believe in goes or anything my dad died at a\nCompany that family cookout never got to say goodbye that\nNight uh she was in bed and she swears he came in fully dressed in a suit and she's scared the crap and she screamed and he disappeared but there are countless examples of that uh throughout a history\nLet's go to the shade in billings Montana first time caller squeeze shaded and go ahead and she doesn't\nGo enjoyed great thank you\nHey I had a question uh last night you were talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in about tonight I write interest is once again I'm actually had a question for ... sure\nUm I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something following and I've been what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you oh my entire life you have\nFrom my from my early childhood I felt there is something following me I had an experience when I was about seven years old\nMy back yard my parents were both inside the house I came in screaming because some some things that my name into my ear in a meeting my ear library while\nSitting right here in ... now have you have ... have you felt threatened or\nDo you feel secure with whatever entity is doing this\nYou know it's kind of a very good field here and then there are times when I feel like I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there's certain people in my life but it goes into effect in wave\nInteresting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left\nMy experience is that if these entities are hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's a cool I mean a um what something is following I think that if someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guardian angel that's looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as dental when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program the name of the book is called more

about whether the brain hallucinates\nShows that light that everybody seems to see going into the tunnel or whether something is really going on here ... is a difficult call isn't it\nI'm Glad you brought this up short they're really really important one because if\nIf there is some truth in what people are experiencing beyond that was the nation perhaps it gets into a window into a reality that we typically do it with her eyes I I think we should explore this one further my perspective on it after having looked at the evidence to me the most compelling evidence are\nThe cardiac arrest studies known as ... cardiac arrest studies\nSo this is where people have their in cardiac arrest ... hated and the experimenter is talk to them soon after they're able to uh soon after they've had the experience rather than ... ... people to remember something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nSo these are cardiologist for capital Dr ... a ... party out from Stony Brook is another one that we all scientists are looking at this and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest come back and described this near death experience and why is that significant\nCardiac arrest severe physiological trauma and medicate the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no blood flow to the brain and the brain stopped functioning\nSo if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate\nLater I'm One example in particular is from doctors\nPants oh it's so hot
