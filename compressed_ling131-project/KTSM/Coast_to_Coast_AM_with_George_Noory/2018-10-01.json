Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nA George I'm always humble that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the drag society these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's always the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I'd be glad to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stops searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement reports see who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything\nI find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they've treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd a sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act of course the confessional Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry in English and they don't have any listen missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nOn Wednesday Neil team is back for a second season

well as people who've gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\nSo this is one of the most frustrating parts of the you know in the public spotlight that go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David flight is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a candidate missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click and and you listen if you don't know if somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listening to him I'm less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm a ... for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased they're\nReleased the report most times times they want there is a case from eighty six\nAnd I there have been so many of these cases in in all of your books about little kids who wander off\nAnd are filmed impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that to nominate\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track but that's\nNot it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last seen well these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address and want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance\nAnd extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail walk away we'll watch the child with a child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents in here think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nWell yeah I mean we talked about a two year old boy that they gassed\nHe traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down and snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it's his mom's that we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours you have to go point six miles per hour\nA buddy kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water um it it seems just impossible unless somebody picked him up for some some thing or someone picked him up and plop them they're\nWell and and the reason these cases have significant is that let's say you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas and they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away well you know\nSure somebody put them in the car girl from there but when you're talking in the middle of the world [laughter] not happening and when you talk about this happening when the\nPeople in the party and anybody never talked to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw anything nobody saw any cars there so how did that try to make a difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one\nThat happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona rather take a break now

heard of the case no well this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles in all the report said that they stay that she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money she loved the outdoors type regularly\nOn January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and was smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture\nAnd asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual named Larry Henderson you said he ... he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nWhile in February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling\nAnd found carols car parked in s this canyon picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly you know I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind did something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving this no I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service and sent in to Forman teams up that trail the search\nWhether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined Carol was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service started to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs month an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time\nThe park superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents they did the Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding

location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never in thousands of reports\nSeen anything described in a national park service report of very weird and scary\nFlight that yeah it's really strange is stealing they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is digging human flesh but there's no source for the older\nWell here's what it says other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us have spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die you smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\nBut ah

pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that ah there was no fire on board when it hit each originally when it hit land it drop one of the bombs accidentally that made the blimp wider was able to take off again and crashing it daily neighborhood\nThere was massive search off the coast that went on for days and they never found anything they review radio bar there was no call for help [noise]\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up into the clouds after dropping the players and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there\nWere lots of water craft in that area they never found the crew and emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd the area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which had several strange disappearances I documented and just sell\nTrue location called half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no or they're part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area\nAnd nothing immediately south half moon bay so it's this one area that have the strings attached to it\nAnd like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\nWell uh like uh maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or I mean could that could does not have happened\n... ... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left of the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\nOr even if they come out of their life jackets they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick ... case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from this guy several a beer cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing for a woman books that looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point at one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch in elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they are they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a at an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked a asked me some questions about the ranch and then he said you\nKnow we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I ask a couple of questions that didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person's credibility and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone or he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with the larger picture but the idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wake up call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area\nTo see if there was anything related to address the parents that I could think my teeth into they can relate it to the activity there\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood because they don't want to draw attention to it\nAnd I've always stated that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it just filled with water I have no cases from there\nIt's bizarre\nIsn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the courts right in the middle of the ... reservation to use a control that property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seen there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there's a lot of drowning said that uh the the ... tribe believes that uh there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and uh so ...\nYou're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no other than animals livestock things of that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of\nOf course we haven't really dug into the historical archives to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines and know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nThe

for sharing that with us I'm not sure it Vince exactly with David ... is a specific criteria but a a David you want to comment on that deal free\nWhat state was that spot in Virginia right\nYeah Virginia and place called ... ... ... outside of the porch with Virginia but interesting like say I am Nineteen forty seven\nJohn appreciate the call it's a great story to get one more call in at least four day we're going to ask wall in Santa Barbara California wild card lines are smaller and more I've\nBeen called called about five times since they've been on and I finally got through your you go I'm\nGoing I'm going to tell you a story of an actual experience but first I wanted to say I think that there's that the higher echelons are working with the parks that won't give you information they don't want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the uh the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the blue to\nTalk about what they look like what the Romans were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it it was before nine teen Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try to find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... seemed like to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and the shuttle can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we shut down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking was what's your name\nThe they'd tell one of the name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I'll swear to God I Am not making this up\nThere was a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you to know it had\nKinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground ... without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought the creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was\nA genetic hybrid this is what I Believe [noise]\nThat's quite

happens all the time that I said a park ranger ... falls or the ... they found him on a national park or what they did\nAnd there was never any investigation about where do you think about that your\nWell you know it goes along with the kind of experiences the day boy this is had dealing with national park service folks the\nHigher ups at least don't want this to be discussed maybe they don't want to scare people out of mud attending a or going to national parks or maybe they know something more about it there are a lot of great people work for the national Park Service U.S Forest

caller like Karen in California like Aaron welcome to the program\nThink enjoy [noise] um I just tell you David uh\nHelps me understand the experience I had a living and working and you ... valley several years ago\nUm we live stay young woman who was take somebody like she was a hostess in a restaurant there and she had gone out on a date and take date delivered to camp and she went missing she'd never went to bed and no one shot and leave\nAnd they look for her for several a week\nAnd the parents who intensely involved themselves his father was a physician [noise] so they found several weeks later at the base of the class\nWhere she had fallen and yet she had just died so ... ... they couldn't really explain how it happened that she had been gone so long and they found him\nDead you know in that way and I also explain how I had gone on civil walks often hikes [noise]\nAh well I live there and I notice\nA wrestling why energy in the woods around me but I never could see anything moving [noise] and it would get closer and louder and closer and louder and kill it would just gave me so much I Would when Ted Kennedy him and it made me limit\nHow much I did fellow walking because I was just a really afraid I Would have that experience again and then another thing I thought was interesting is when I look fair I'm\nI was friends with people that were in the medical field damage to the hospital and we got to that experience is that we'd had while living there and working there and and ah one of the physicians explained to have several people felt this dread and depression\nAnd anxiety and almost like feeling like they're being stopped and I and the most severe cases they had put these people on let's see in in order to control the symptoms settled\nA they attributed that situation and the experiences to the clinic and whatever\nYou know a influence that is having on the people who live there and the people who visits there so um I didn't realize that was going on when I Lived there you know it was all new to me this is several years ago but David really helped me\nUnderstand my kind of experience I was having and how it could be that this young woman was found at least she was found\nSo you had the the feeling and you could hear sound that suggested something was just off the path in the in the brush the trees or whatever or have been an animal or something else no\nNo because I'm a late winter early spring when I first moved there so they were very few people on the trails and I\nIt was like it was almost like when they talk about that ... that you can see something that they lead the liens move that you can't see any feet hitting a lead you know can make them less soul or a month so that was the kind of thing I was experiencing where\nThere was actually something that but I couldn't see it and that was leaving you know will this advertising that it was there and it would get close to you know as I got said about the trail so that's when I turn around and come back and\nYou know it was just freaked me out I couldn't handle it so\nThe ... you're the words that you use dread and depression is the feeling that the employees had been there for a while um I Would imagine that the people there are now who are familiar with what's going on in this culture of people who've vanished a would have the same kind of feelings would be\nThis week in Nineteen fifty five Baltimore cult full back Alan and meet she becomes the first rookie in NFL history to top one hundred yards rushing in his first two games get a

there's no way they lifted any weight and even to adult men that looked like lumberjacks again they look just like the people on the brownie paper towels\nWould have had a hard time picking up a like a four hundred pound ATV and somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt\nThe two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes I Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses\nBut I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes wide again just like if aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the cloud shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere so\nThey just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\n[noise] they kind of stopped in chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake and like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life\nSometimes don't sink in until after the fact and you know I started thinking about it we'll wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show [laughter]\nAlone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was in those\nSim woods where I heard this ah ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal

listeners asking me witness that missing for one one guy coming back Wednesday ... going to be back on the air\nAnd I always tell them not soon enough we get more requests for Dave than any other guest that I've experienced since I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveils a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found this true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great to have you back\nGeorge I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI Want to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations that I have not uh I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books uh insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities of some of the missing to your own life right\n[noise] you know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost and when you meet these people it really brings brings\nHome the emotion and [noise] there's a lot of parallels to my life a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise] I've put\nIn the book just recently probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and hopefully people see that you know hey\nIf people are really really good people the right to drag fighting these are\nThe upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it seems to me that it's only the high rollers the people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him in ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil the evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out one from how absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can [noise]\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been going to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems\nA lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and it's frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration in their voice a\nLot in common one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stop searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote the search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement reports\nSee who they interviewed who they talked to were they searched the effectiveness of the search\nOr the areas that they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you really searching blind and there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything I've I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they treated you again and ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service\nGovernment entities in general because they've sent you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but it's really kind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training they're smart people they understand what should be done\nNerds rejoice as the big bang theory returns for its twelfth season
