G Jonathan how do we explain this how do you explain this to people who are non believers in all this who might say oh you just tap ... what do you say to them\nWell first I look at him for a while and I try to figure out what might resonate with someone like that but I often start with\nI happen to believe at this point that the past\nAnd the president and the future all exists in the infinite roam our human senses only perceive a small slice of what exists in the infinite world\nSo I don't view that I'm a good judge of what exists outside of what I can see with my eyes or ears you know the the basic human senses and so I generally try to start with that and I asked someone well how do you know you are seeing everything that is\nHow do you know that would question the question and often that stop\nSomeone because one can take a book\nWith a pattern on it and move it in such a way in front of your eyes that it goes through a blind spot and then you're I technically can't see it but the image is still there\nTo your to your brain\nJohn do you believe in God\nI Believe in a higher power I Believe in a higher wisdom I Believe in a higher form of energy the I find that there's no other explanation for all of us\nWere you angry with a higher power when this happened\nYou know I wasn't and\nI really had a hard time getting angry I found the most comfort in accepting if you will come my way\nAnd my hope is my sense is that this flow has a higher meaning that I don't have all the details but if I go with it rather than fight it it makes my day is a lot easier\nWhat message would you have for somebody drawn who's going through the same thing you went through\n[noise] the message I Would say would be when it gets really really dark that's where you find something that's really really light [laughter]\n[noise] and it sounds like you have devoted your lifestyle to this mission of getting the word out about what happened to ... the dangers of some of these medicines and of course what's on the other side don't stop or right\nI I don't intend to I Am I'm definitely devoted to communicating what happened to him but at a higher humanistic level they're George there are

keep becoming more interesting it was nearly three years ago at the end of January twenty sixteen I reported at ... dot com and my coast to coast AM radio broadcast then\nThat a new ninth planet or planet X. was indirectly discovered at the far edge of our solar system where the hyper belt and the ... cloud meet\nThe hyper belt is a disc shaped residue of rock dust in ice left over from our solar system creation and it extends from the orbit of Neptune out far beyond Pluto to about fifty astronomical unit from our son\nAnd the crowd of mostly ice and us goes\nMuch further starting where that ... rebelled in an extension for three point to light years from earth and fear Ikle shape that surround our entire solar system including the ...\nAnd I have a beautiful graphic of this at mayor files dot com report for people to see what our solar system really looks like\nNow I say planet nine when indirectly found in twenty sixteen because to date no human on earth has yet seen this hypothesize massive object\nBut Michael Brown PHD professor of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere and now it's back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nProtests are brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer that got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called Eris out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argued that Pluto or should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to dwarf planet and the hyper belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto and why it had it coming\nWhen I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing a go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to collector together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits\nClose quote now that is why so far it is an indirect discovery\nIt's now late twenty eight team after several tries at the ... territories in Hawaii defined planet nine and visible light and or infrared professor brown\nSays that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth and\nJust a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this little safe planet nine or planet\nThat he uh is\nHeld trying to mine and he told me that he is\nPlanning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able to actually get to the big bang theory math because they've been working on computer refinement\nAnd for example he told me in a recent interview that calculation place I'm seeing body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun so that is putting it in a spot that is something like ... times further than ... than\nGood way out there but they have ... narrow down the folk so yeah there were only going on November first started another surge because that new calculation\nPredict that planet nine is closer to a car elation that can only be seen by American I in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology planetary science department in Pasadena, California it struck me professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion\nIs a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date when you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eye because so far the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what your I Would say just taking pictures with ...\nWhat about him for rent infrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because we don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet nine looking at it in the end for a study of will be very important but\nIt's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that all of this impact on the solar system perturbations and even just being the plane of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nYeah I think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it\nIt'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail with probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing in that direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [laughter] this is what we mean when we say a planet in the outer part of the solar system\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might come from why is this massive\nObject all the way out to the edge of the hype about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has all of this is just speculation\nCan probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a Neptune like planet just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clothes it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland\nA mostly just kind of grayish white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing that I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than Neptune for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd he is that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light days from earth is that the border between the hype rebels and the ... cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond the planet and we don't quite know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nHand picked up a good ... percent of a score from audiences sores already a money maker handlers are good chance of more Michael Meyers coming soon\nStar is

coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change Linda\nSo what was something like a one and a hundred events can become as often as every other year and so these really extreme floods extreme heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those that stuff to us\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on it my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which does or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that short a period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and how and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migrations away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be a ban doesn't votes on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger I'm forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you go ... billions of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low law to choose\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war in ... all of the the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post but\nThis has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency during the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken root now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as recently as for years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing more definitely bring more wars\nYes go\nWell it it's a terrible future if we can get this under control and one of the big headline the summer of twenty Eighteen\nMillion for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the next the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that um the forty eight continental US

global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida\nWell have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is the extended by computers

thirty PM mountain and another time zones around the country in the world I've been in my office where I'm Talking to you tonight\nIn front of his computer to share news with the general audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like uh my YouTube channel\nWell just to three weeks ago in October third I was doing update on three category the first had to do with the\nVery distressing subject of half cats beheaded cats\nAround the world bloodless\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was Fox is in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection\nThat he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked into the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Holland an Airforce base a that down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then third update\nHad evolved from my asking my or fires YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\nSo I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a fighter shot a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was ever on a ... like something coming through the window and the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a ... report what are the smoky fog sometimes link to afterlife return you can see the whole story and you can see the videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of the whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder on October seventeenth adding to\nThe mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me\nEmails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like act applies them I Do not know this is extremely a translucent\nAnd uh when I started reading the letters I began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of the parents to loved ones to children to parent\nNone they but but I started receiving these emails and one\nCame from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent\nAnd his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center\nFlorida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight thinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog in my office\nWhen I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazards\nAre talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now some city center Florida home\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn screw the camp area on a riding mower and cleaning up the facility things of that nature\nSo at the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after showering I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the covers of them myself and just lay there and looked outside\nThe leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see and then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I open them again\nAnd through the window I can see this\nMisty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was that in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looked like it was coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three dimensional lighted Ira Glass passing by my field of vision\nI was mesmerized by these hiring lives and the feeling that I was getting was a feeling of euphoria and one is with this living thing that was surrounding me and then at the same moment everything was happening at the same time at the same time\nI was getting all this information that was almost like answers to questions that haven't been asked out millennia\nAnd they were all be answered at the same time like all of these answers was coming I wasn't asking the questions they were just coming to me and be answered simultaneously\nAnd I don't know why this was happening I was just going with it I don't even know how long this lasted it could have been just a moment but it seemed to go on forever and I didn't want it to end because of the feeling was so loving\nCan you describe the shape of the hiring Bush that you remember vividly and try to give us an impression of look kind of information was coming to you and was it like a word voice in your head ... possibly\nKnow there were no words there was no sound the hiring glitz we're almost like God was looking straight ahead and they were coming towards me and then going past the side of my head\nAnd I can see peripherally these hybrids ... but they had the same texture as the fog good would shadow in life\nBut they were living minutes at the same time and they would just float by me but kind of means\nAt the same time like they were walking back and forth as they were passing by my head and as far as the information I was getting it was just almost like a downloaded information\nThat was so quick that I was not able to grasp anything that was being given to me it was just a feeling that I was getting\nIt was almost like I knew every answer to every question like I was just super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe\nWas indescribable it's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now at that moment it was for something that was being given to me\nBut I wouldn't remember any of it afterwards but it was for some time in the future that I was supposed to recall misinformation because it was like it was being given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any subject in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the

P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price to go down\nThe whole I guess not but could super retired than a hundred dollars announced\nHope you adjusted for inflation George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think is a one hundred dollars is well within reach\nOne could that happen over the next seven to ten years but we believe most

extraterrestrials called the hockey team here and everything else you stronger those are believed that part but they both seemed to agree there's an extra pointed out\nWhat let me just tell you this story I was going to about what really happened\nThe first time I met Zacharias itching I was working in New York City at the year was I Believe uh the fall of eighty three [noise] and I was working on a film for UNICEF or about their twenty fourth anniversary and efforts to save children's\nLives around the world and I got the book the twelfth planet\nAnd I was reading it and I wanted to meet whoever Zacharias itching was because I had done a strange harvest in Seventy nine to eighty and was very very now fascinated him and the idea that there were other intelligence is interacting with our planet probably based here\nAnd uh I did some tracking down and learned that Zacharias that Jim was working and living in Manhattan I'm over on the East River working at UNICEF and I found out a phone number I had no idea where it was but I had a phone number for given to me\nAnd I called up and a woman answers\nAnd said she was the secretary for Zacharias itch in and I set up a meeting I had an address I had been in New York long enough to know exactly where I was going in a taxi\nBut when the taxis stop I sure\nKnew where I was I was in front of the Rockefeller Center and I'm thinking\n... situation has an office in has a the Rockefeller Center at a secretary so I went in\nAh gave the name of who I was going and meeting a I was passed over to a elevator told that when I got out of something like the thirty second floor I was to walk a certain distance and I would be looking for a certain number\nAnd when I came out of the elevator and I'm walking on like a marble floor with beautiful mahogany doors everything is six quiz it then I immediately in my mind is where I went\n... situation is not a humble writer he's working for the government officially\nWhat went into my mind when I reach the number on the door and I had to have a brother and I had to be buzzed in and then there was a woman sitting behind a glass\nIs like if you went to a doctor's office with a whole ah it where you would talk through and I am seeing\nOut in the city of New York through a fan huh wow huge glass window and by then I Know that one of these thirty five thousand dollar a month off and uh she said a just a moment and she\nMade some kind of a phone or intercom connection that now you can go in and so I wasn't\nEven in his office I was in an outer chamber minutes ago and\nThen I went in and it was a beautiful weather window overlooking New York\nAnd when we sat down and talk and I'm staring at decorated pitch and blue eyes magnified by his black eye glasses or blue don't her eye glasses I pitch and have you ever in the past\nOr now worked for any intelligence agency at the United states government or any other government\nAnd he sat daring at me and I swear to God is my what if I'd had it I caught it would've been a forty five seconds stare between him and men inside of me and keep your mouth shut you caught the ball you wait for his answer\nAnd when he began to

June\n... good way out there but they have ... narrow down the focus so he has deliberately going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until\nThe winter before we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first that's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet now and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but it's not probably the best way to look for it\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look yet it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing another direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like no no no it's five thousand times more massive [noise] this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the tuition was\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or not he was inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition of\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune we think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it'll be a gaseous atmosphere\nIt probably won't have clones it's probably too cold to have any clouds up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGrayish white atmosphere with no features in it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing but I Know for sure is that there will be sings about it that we never even thought about that are completely surprising\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it at something like twenty times further than up to him for example so it's a good ways out there\nAnd use that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter of ... it's about two and a half
