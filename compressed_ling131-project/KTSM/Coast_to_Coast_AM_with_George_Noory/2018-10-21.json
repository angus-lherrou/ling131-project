C.\nI got everyone from a recipe it into the apostle John in the Bible and poison and political poisonings hit their peak right around the renaissance Italian Renaissance on the fourteenth century and even today food tasters are used to certain navigate that um you know everything [laughter] and\nHere's some people who have actually tried to poison other people throughout history\nOr you know it sounds outlandish that our president can be poison this way but it's it's actually quite a kind of thing the emperor cloudy us the polio and Mark Anthony Petra Queen Elizabeth King Henry the eighth Abraham Lincoln these people all were so worried about\nPoisoning they all had foods pastors let's say we're a little bit more sophisticated about this we actually have um in America we have the presidential food safety theme and there to set up\nA security zone where the first family can be without complication in the cockpit of a you know food screeners and people who watch people prepare the food and ah if you get outside\nOf that the White House's own even the air in the White House just over I mean that's quite as oh right right outside of that if you travel\nUm you will they'll go back\nTo having food testers and they've used everything from military prisoners to monkeys to dogs the taste or the fish food\nUm both Presidents Bush Clinton Reagan and even President Obama when they were traveling were using the same thing so this is this is a legitimate threat I'm In Nineteen Ninety three um Turkey's eighth president was poisoned or the Bulgarian embassy when he drink lemonade\nAt a reception\nRight the right this is a this is a for real thing here um as far as\nWorld War two is concerned\nHow they tried to get rid of each other there were forty two attempts on Hitler's life from Nineteen thirty three to Nineteen forty four\nAnd even Irwin rom all they knew Hitler was crazy or when Ronald a desert Fox they're great in the ... infantry genius he started a coup from inside inside Germany to assassinate\nUm ah it off Hitler\nAnd on July twenty at Nineteen forty four it was discovered his ... his ah communication was discovered with other people inside of Germany\nAnd they took him from his house in the air force them to to bite into assign capsule so they were trying to poison and assassinate people back and forth probably the most hilarious of this Winston Churchill my cousin when singer show like I knew the guy you know\n[laughter] you're like this yeah yeah right\nSo um you know they try to get each other back and forth a multiple times Hitler was going after us so fiercely hit operation long John\nWhere he tried to assassinate Churchill FDR and style and during the ... conference but possibly the most has the most hysterical of all of these is a page right out of Maxwell smart\nIs the Nazis were very good bomb makers\nAnd they knew um the Nazis and everybody had spies everywhere and every and every government enough to say we're not all that special way of spies too so [laughter]\nI'm Churchill they discovered like chocolate it was a poorly fell like find chocolates so what they did is they crafted the Germans being crafted a\nBomb to make it look like a chocolate bar and they it was a bomb and it was um made\nWith thick rich dark chocolate and it was you know lovely lovingly prepared or doing rap with gold and it was Peters chocolate\nAnd it was placed by one of their operatives who was in Britain on one of the trays along with other luxury items to be taken into the um the war cabinet\nAnd what they were trying to do is they were trying to blow Winston Churchill's head off with an exploding chocolate bar [laughter] you can't make this up Richard you just can't do it you know so I mean there's\nI mean they went back and forth you know all the time doing this so let's fast forward to the ah innocence naivete or ignorance of FDR\nWho is taking jars of caviar in cases of vodka from Scotland the same guy

I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts of the time and um you know I spent ten years researching all this stuff and you know FDR not quite that much for sure but um there was this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I check it out\n[noise] uh Easter the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my play\nThe idea that the ... originally made their money to the science trade that for a day a wet I'm more a humane way to make money and the Rockefeller a\nStar it out lighting houses with kerosene that fly that combat stumble engine that guy's a gas ... like a byproduct then that can End Days ran they got down these guys\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and and they\nHave a clue as to how they make their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with similar in South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when he came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influenced things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly and Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the FCC the security Exchange Commission\nAnd FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter] really interesting\nStuff so that's what I Know about that I mean if there's more information out there I'd love to hear it but their their their money came from or\nA and also I Would I Would imagine I'm you know it's an old it's an old east coast family uh probably it's all money so you know just kind of keep the Toomey elation of wealth over generations compound interest um that sort of thing when you have all money\nI'd also hurt and I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother the Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain than those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be some of that as well\nYeah I heard that about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book on let me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour\nI'd be lucky [laughter] by the time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you know of course um

five\nThomas's taught a class based on the sad thing for the center for lifelong learning he's spoken publicly numerous times both in person on the radio and in September twenty twelve he spoke to the prestigious lecture series mind and super mind\nWhich is run by the SBC see Graham Hancock selected Thomas as he is author of the month for march twenty twelve and again for August twenty four team is the author of living the paradox of enlightenment\nAnd his article Houdini afterlife experiment did it work Thomas resentful welcome to the coast to coast am how are you\nI'm way Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease um how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he there was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise]\nHe um was not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics we're talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they want it to kill him but I think they wanted to say\nBack off men we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might have spent some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he he would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and he would be ready for that but\nThis time there's this guy came backstage and Harry wasn't\nExpecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in his abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would have lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em\nBut one other point I on this subject about these fake medium he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he wouldn't even get the guy that we can control the lights and on the deal and Harry would show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise the magician would be in the middle of his\nYou know they say on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something like this guy or whatever and lights would come up a photographer would take a picture and\nAnd that you know the fake medium would be totally surprised if it were you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to\nPull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps\nSome of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right into\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right I thought\nIt was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an of vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife uh we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the finding in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did looked at the oil as the leader of the spiritual as\nA matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and I think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and\nThey enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nSome flicks getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movies that'll be a young Jake Gyllenhaal and the weird cool Donnie ... of pizza place ...
