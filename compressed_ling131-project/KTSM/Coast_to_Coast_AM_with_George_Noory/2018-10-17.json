twilight zone episodes or they're a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nYeah what was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called night gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even hitched it he's the one who probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\nYeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and he did so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never wrote a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary I'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells you know he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away\nFor long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out a is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know they're going way back to get these shows the to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for you on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is written by Michael Wilson and rod Serling\nA coke credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol Serling was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe he had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you\nKnow the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own universe or a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nAh documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time they were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing is how fully developed rod certainly could write a story and a character and twenty four minutes you

zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually one step beyond I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by year I'm Out of limits came afterwards but I Believe a one step beyond which started in fifty eight I think\nNext up we're going to end in Tulsa, Oklahoma Edward taken away I appreciated\nGeorgia and Nick you know I\nWas strolling man he was ... he had the ability to be able to understand human nature because if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of his experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about uh the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes is hard to say which is my favorite but I think it had to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming home from Italy crashes in the desert\nThe capital of that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry and Bob coming it's just having me walking by and seen his newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that nation you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd having psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock of seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it\nThe nurse bodies closing out there and she said well

in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany the Arctic thought he could alter that event\nOf course but a man I don't know it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story\nThe guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store I end the call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine [laughter]\nWhen he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was through a man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went in the back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bags to all of a sudden became full of gifts just did it uh you know empty cans\nMan he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy that ran a department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John free sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where'd you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gift rent it and I'm just giving them out\nLooking at the police station

now and does an awful lot of good for the blind and for students who need scholarships yep\nIt sure does how did you get involved in the collectibles\nI got an aunt way a lot of people just failed that everything else\n[laughter] not really but you know I I was a middle aged guy I was in a restaurant business I was the stock market forecaster\nStuff that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked in a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out the way things usually working life\n... that's true but people of color collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties\nI don't know where they are I asked my mother who's eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George ... we gave them away what I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they will be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card\nSuppose it was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were at a tag sale\nAlright you're running around out there in the city angels and you come across an old old house I hundred years old\nBig coup all out there and there's a farmer saying I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of that stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit not the tag sale or some facts you guys can outsmart\nRight right you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years yes see a fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask them a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for idea by the by it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nWell that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars [laughter] no yeah oh\nI had ALS Caroline's and mental saying Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes [laughter]\nI had to do with kids we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards from\nIran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles or what would those cards you've been worse if you'd given them the him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much probably it would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having them sign a napkin\nYeah exactly now old football cards and stuff so they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do a little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right now everybody's on the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nPlaying football ... interesting to write basketball cards\nI once saw a guy who had a complete [noise] he had Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards it's called the big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie cards on oh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze banished basketball card\nBut nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be by you get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth it\n[laughter] and I did have a an honest Wagner card did you really you know it's like a million dollars\n[laughter] yeah it thought two million if it has a a a\nA a Piedmont back gosh yeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible in history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so after\nI always say you know the way to make money in and take the jets instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old doesn't\nLook at how dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gifts things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's going to buy a\nYacht no everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican to love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse yeah you're right by its name the named beautiful [noise] um and he was he ... right there is also a lot of people live in New York they love that\nYou know there's so much commonsense to the business I'm In an almost everybody who's out there listening to

which ball\nWhich ball um and the old days you know this is all this stuff about medical\nScience and science itself is brand new a lotta that didn't come about and sell the mid nineteenth century right\nYou know we think that we're in this advanced day but we're back at the beginning of mankind mankind just really got started about fifty thousand years ago as a successful tool making you know a race\nSo we're at the very beginning of mankind right now science came about and even now just recently now which balls were when people they couldn't understand why the good lord would allow their\nThree children to die\nYou know they did their prayers they were good\nPay people to happen but\nSure enough they had five kids about three of them died the pots or polio or some doggone thing\nWhich balls were blown by glass staffers and they were put those in the windows to keep bad spirits from entering a house\n\nAnd um it was um big medicine to to our a colonial on federal forefathers and for mothers\nDid a lot of houses have these things\nOh my goodness yeah I Would say that I'm One out of five\nIt was a common thing and houses in the old days that's a lot\nNow maybe even more than that there there's quite a few which balls around still today I just sold seven of them this week of mostly to one person\nHow big are they went out there about the size of a baseball\nOK smaller small home and on the glass youthful\nColors they would um to to blow a color glass in the old days if you put gold into your a metal into your glass batch that would give you cranberry gal glass\nAnd you know if you drop that it would shatter no doubt that\nSure what but you know a cranberry which ball in the window is very expensive\nBut that would have a real good chance so repellent evil spirits sometimes you come across glass canes\nAt a tag sale and people say what good's the glass paying like a rubber ... polio ward is the old terrible joke goes right by the glass came they hung up in the house a woman would take that that would catch the bad ones to get into your house woman would take it out to the river\nAnd clean it and their fight to spell her house the bad spirits and that was their way of keeping children um their children safe\nYou were on the television show American Pickers vote was that like\nI was a blast you know a lot of people ask medical

really good at their job it's funny how many at the dealers I hear knock them they're not there no dummies let's put it that way\nAnd in terms of buying those things is the TV show that gives them the money to buy the goods or did they do that themselves out\nLike me you know they ...\nAmerican Pickers run around the country and their truck and they want it to make their life more interesting they get a little um quick a video thing on themselves set it off to the TV they all ... people say these guys are pretty cool made it the the shell out of that\nWould you buy an oil rig the Coca Cola

the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms reading obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there's so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know by going to have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and it is certainly a whole lot of you know of of jumped to but\nUm but I think in general here would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you I'm sure he he would hate reality television a pat on the um he\nAnd and I don't say that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television Ford's time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show the normal you know regular everyday person and they you know a trot as family members out there and they would go to his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the show or you know he thought it was just an invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality show and he would have but but I think there are so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nOld time television to knock a really did not understand the racial mix ups demographics when you\nGet some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nAnd they were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking to older white guys [laughter] where did the television you know it would be difficult to get that kind of a\nPerson like Jimmy Durante for example you you thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know young you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and how they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know had on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nAnd it's amazing let's take some calls let's go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you're talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed at what I was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me was as far as the visual impact was which is a testament to the you know the cinematographer or the lighting directors which I just\nI was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish was watering from Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots\nOkay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with that that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and uh so and he did he got the most out of\nOut of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nThe actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like I have the beholder or you know nightmare twenty thousand feet or something and then he went to one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford start yeah yeah has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on television a and that was a great great show when he was a very good in it too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small flying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom\n[laughter] it's\nCalled the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the you know spin offs person you know ha says a few things\nI found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery a because everybody thought she was ugly in she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else looked like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered episode\nAnd the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above the fallout shelter\n[noise] yeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to be you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what that is what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into it and they can all get into it and they turn on each other and it was yes that was a terrifically a well known episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nHi are you know I'm an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally or at least ... years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas dealer\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great and you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all an hour long as opposed to the half hour I'll\nRarely yeah okay yeah and miniature was one of the hour long episodes and it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit\nAt the time that uh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated\nSo it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years or in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on pulled the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah yeah cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation you know in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're high\nLike a couple of questions or one would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape is\nWell then maybe someone stay back in the sixties I'm just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone that would be almost like an escape from your daily reality\nAnd I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which\nSome flicks getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movie ... a young Jake Gyllenhaal and the weird cool Donnie ... pizza place ... gave way to hell why not the new horror comedy slice comes out this week\nAnd hand on the complete opposite side of the spectrum kids Daniel tiger movie lands on
