to the show and thanks for joining me William\nHow are you feeling good good\nSo tell me first of all what led you to even create such assistance such a a a out of body ventures idea\nWell over forty years ago I had my own uh I had an out of body experience to go back to Nineteen Seventy three\nAnd I was not a believer in them should be impossible\nBut I had a friend of mine that I had a spontaneous experience in college and I decided to board it was a life changing experience for him so I began to investigate it found that there was a message to self initiate and out of body experience so\nOur boredom and for it took me I Believe on the twenty fourth day of having a daily exercise um I initiated my first holy ... out of body experience and it was\nIt was completely life changing I mean 'cause I was not a believer but I wanted to explore and experience it\nSee if it was real for myself and it's it's quite a life change your ...\nYour entire life a whole paradigm of your perception of reality shifted\nOh yeah it is but now you had your ... billion which sounds induced it wasn't through a an accident or any type of trauma right\nRight it was self induced through um like a meditative exercise\nUh that I\nThat I learned and then I developed many different kinds that we can do to self initiate the experience\nWas this before or after you became a\nOh that was way before yeah I later became a hip no therapist and I was a I used it to develop other techniques to help to negotiate these altered states and out of body experiences\nSo after you had these experiences yourself then you went into helping other people experienced the same thing so tell me about your whole B. E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it just said\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize and at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew\nI was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent Rio and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body ... guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this in my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing\nMay um but they didn't\nI didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea\nAbout the what I had first stepped into here and a ... over the decades\nAnd years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was or not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system mhm\nI always think you know is incredible as our our world is and\nKnow this incredible below that we're in\nA given topic couldn't it stops here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information to human beings why would the universe just create one type of human being and that doesn't make any [laughter]\nAbsolutely not and once you have to mention that once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional [laughter] and\nAnd that there is there's trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and not all human there has to be it wouldn't just be one [laughter] you know one of anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent than than we can do that I can express mhm\nYeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they emailed me you know he was playing because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an addict and mention is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's generally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died a I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who who had passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved\nAnd there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity\nExperience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there was no\nUm when I teach my classes I there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow you're listening you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body [noise]\nYes it is

experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there was a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now these when you are when people aren't going to be travels he gained ... the brain argue make any type of um recording um their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nA matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's\nPut it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up\nTo a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques are and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about\nHow to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how the go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm\nSkills that are taught any more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about finding a mind near twenty people hooked up to the mind\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to\nBut that's that's that's\nOne of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people how they have the experience themselves and not only have it put control it\nAnd get the most of it my main goal is to teach\nFor her to have a profound\nA

D. as Sam [noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is William Boleyn and he's talking\nAbout out of body travel and he's been doing twenty research at the Monroe Institute surveyed over sixteen thousand participants who have\nGone through the OB e training at them in real Institute in Virginia and he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with these obese women was wondering if you could explain some of this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying nursing\nPractice you know for forty\nOr just to go on my website after him for dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did a\nA number of surveys and our receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries by the way and it ... it was amazing how similar\nKinds of experiences that people were happening\nWe're so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds\nAs a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nUh Seventy two percent at some point experienced some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted are touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through closed islets if you're seen through your clothes ... at night and you can begin to see you are already in the process of shifting your consciousness\nYour non physical body because you're having it doesn't mean you've actually did your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude in the phenomena associated these are common things that uh for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body\nRight is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nThat gap I see them on because then half I'm retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that an out of money you\nKnow I'm I'm saying it's not that I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this\nIs what I have found and what many other um experiences have seen and explored\nEveryone when they sleep we all humans are moving at a face from our body sets with sleep is ... we take for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with her body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floated I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches out of the phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience\nLosing ... image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream began or\nThey may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural was breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... bc temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years\nWe didn't ... biological machine ... and then we're ... we're all moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just it's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess wordplay\nAnd most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game but very few people are aware of it and you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell if you wanted to ask the question like how did the here and they get here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried that and I'm curious how would you know the difference between now and imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I Begin to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back into the seventies\nAnd I was still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience\nI Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nMean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when often will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just the download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives until I started to have my own that's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or their money ain't anyone other than you know\nRight I and it's very important that sets self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAt Marion point\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines and [noise] you know I always ask somebody\nThat's an avid believer and anything left of specialty uh religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India ah eh we're had\nBeen programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this ... and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you have to experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of first out of money doing things going on you know that people recruited recount changing and it's often heated experience it happens over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is really sent you forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi

I was scared to death I truly was and but right there at the end it was like a a breath of fresh air came on me and I wasn't worried about anything any more\n... pounds he's so peaceful and is is what it was exactly peaceful\nHave you been able to recreate than experience I'm not feeling that experience a peace\n\nNow I Wish I could ... it would actually be a great\nWell maybe that's maybe you can blame could heat\nYeah absolutely one of the things that people do report\nWhen they have and out of body experience um is that they have this immense feeling of a love and peace it fly that just flows through them mhm uh I've talked about this many times um it's like you're entering into a some people report it\nLike their entry into a sea of of love and um and acceptance and it's and it's like it's difficult to even ... there was no words to even describe some of these things\nBecause they're beyond our um our verbiage but yes I mean that's one of the reasons that people do a explore these experiences so they can ah let's just say connect with those higher aspects of themselves\n...\nNow and thank you very much ... ... ... I mean has there ever been reporting of that and not a good experience to be is it you can't not right\nYou know just like there has been an end to ease and nightmares in ... leave your fear\nBased if you've been brought up with this concept that there is a devil\nOf Satan around every corner waiting for you to pounce on you you're going to have light you made likely have negative experience your own fear will create it when we leave our bodies were entering into a very thought responsive dimensional space\nAnd that's what people forget and I I I say this all the time you know we're not observers of non physical reality we're participants\nEach thought is a creative projection and we are influencing the energy is around us we do it in the physical but slowed down here\nBut when you leave your body through near death experiences\nSame applies to um if you're doing ... San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if you're a fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with us into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative entered its you are going to create it when your mind is going to mold of reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness in a negative beings and whatever then you're going to manifest that as well well he or creative\nPowerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and you have to take responsibility for your experience some people\nLike to hear this but the it's the truth\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that he had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got up and let her cycle and took off their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person I don't know anyone that um\nBrides or owns a motorcycle and it was as it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there wasn't a premonition of anything that happened it just isn't it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak pianist and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because I was scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know of that ad well out of body travel less likely\nMhm well it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there is no consensus reality there's that's that's why it's important to learn about a consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create I Try called consensus\nThere's many types of reality that exist in in a multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to start to learn new what is essentially the rules a non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here we're used to live in your\nCar and writers to gravity\nWe're used to air you know when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing the air you know you don't have gravity all the things we're used to have to you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm In my work shops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI

proceeding commercial about pain because\nGold tonight is to have everyone Peter Pan [laughter] I'm going to scare the pie that's lovely record\nI was thinking about that commercial say can you really they pee on an original is is that this is Jerry anyway I'll go to the [laughter]\nFunny yeah thank you very much and um thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nUs so well you send me your book and we do are you constantly in ...\nAll right are you doing guys shows and I thought it was fascinating because you're so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience where we are normal\nWell this is this I've been seeing goes since I was the un knee high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening and so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friends dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado\nMhm and so the two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal convention and uh we've we\nCall it a ... feast because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghosts or things that go from the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I got particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to shift for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGoes legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to buy were cancer and how do you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that I like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nWhat do you mean seeing it you you\n... I see it and I actually feel it\nI mean like humans examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things\nI'm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future but\nWhat I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that\nUm but I let's see I think okay so I was a professional story tell her from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast\nIn managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I had haunted wine and cheese parties\nYou know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this\nWe are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight as a hundred percent true we were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought an old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because they wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion\nWell what happened is I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast and I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything\nAnd at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was in California because she I mean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died\nAnd so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email um and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts violate just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter]\nExtremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us that they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans\nAnd said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture in the house ... what have you well after us you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and I'm an artist you know and it's\nVery iffy that I'm In a soothing you can see where this is going roe [laughter]\nSo I actually called the owner's son\nAnd he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know it would just sold a few things and he goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSong about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest estate so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like this while I hired twenty people\nUm to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge state so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you jumping Malone flu everything\nIn

improve their it's here they are in\nPrison here by their own their own their own minds that they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during my time yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning but\nI find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye is at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter hidden lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes the judge and make sure when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you living in now haunted or did you met with non salute legions of gas goes follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten\n[laughter] just kidding [laughter]\nBut um that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that\nGoing to crack you at that I thought that the street lights and manage who were on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... they would go out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know the certain locations\nAnd then my son has well why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of that trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this town is very hunted by\nWell it's too for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when you walk around there and then went there once a month doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the tops of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nYou get to you too I mean I think that sometimes it just happens to some people with the tripping out the lights\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd the ... that you notice that would happen to other people who are just you know you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much that then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it well so\nThey're like oh I actually you know how to do to kick them really I'm Serious I was just wondering if that happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that\nAre there are there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage the springs that you know are also carry that type of energy and that's the\nEssence of rain there oh yeah you know this family hotel right there on a NATO summit very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down\nOn managing springs and bolder and even as to part with s that infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see it light up with the red energy\nI find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountains very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the signing right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the pikes peak they believe what the naval at the end ever I find that fascinating because maybe it's a portal\n[noise] you know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love that stuff hikes peak it's very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it\nAnd um we're going to take a break in just a minute and maybe you can

J. D. as them [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am my guest is Stephanie waters and we're talking about Colorado legends and lower and when we were talking a little bit before the break about pikes peak now there's many places in the world that have lots of legends lord but this particular one pikes peak has\nA lot it's considered one of the\nMore usual places in the world as well as um because of its kind of rich waters and mineral rich area in that particular region of the u._s. can you tell us a little bit about your experience as many ... you know to be\nWell I'm pikes peak I think it was called T. T. V. a TiVo or have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it but they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe\nI just love that I loved belly buttons anyway but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why are we going to call that connected to the mother okay yeah it's connected\nTo the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get um father sky Mother Earth ... and so the significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out\nFrom the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb\nThat and the natives knew that if they are of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold rush\nA produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right that I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and\nThey talk about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHearing cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw UFO when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon it was clear they lied\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards with other town it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that's that's amazing and they were hungry and they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating 'cause today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a government experiment gone\nExactly exactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ... mhm theoretically\nSack played up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed\nThe sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine you would not\nThere it's a lot of people around yeah\nBut a lot of people saw this I mean just outrageously crazy\nAnd he followed his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's there was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know\nFarmers in Colorado where thing that I mean this was amazing back then you know um we you know that we've had the telegraph\nOf them do you think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan messiah us and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot or come to his back door opened his door actually um [noise] he um the big foot actually rubbed at the high neon his screen door and he actually had some big hair\n[laughter] and um then has\nReally committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick lessen the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot of you might not\nHave you seen in the writing\nHe believes that my friend he only if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating and my friend actually believes that his property is a port hole\nWhere big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider\nThe possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing link maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and go and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature big foot now would say\n[laughter] I wouldn't have gone Chinese would know\nThat there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the ... Native American Indians depending on\nWhere they lived in the Rockies where they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's why we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean that's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating you'd open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense\nYou know all of a thing being once we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it just like to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up within the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men issue springs area and garden of the guards in the areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by law\nThey're when three years of my life down the drain allied skull and cheated myself out everything I loved\nMy money my stuff my friends and family\nI'm clean now and I want to stay that way\nBut it's weird 'cause I used to be one of those people who saw an addict and said I can never be one of them\nToday one in six kids has abused prescription drugs lock your medicine cabinet and safely dispose of expired or unused medications talk with your kids about the dangers of prescription drugs and there'll be half as likely to abuse them busy drug free Texas dot org or call eight seven seven nine no drug\nThis week south Stevie stream\nHere's like you've been watching on TV this week season to you is under way of the CBS Drama SEAL Team ...

E. where did you go what did you experience how did you know it just feels\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but the first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room a going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you\nFocus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nSeries of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realize I was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew\nI was standing by the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real when I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings\nThat was my first experience it was relatively brief\nBut it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was ... at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about the what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it yeah well it's\nIt's it's exciting and because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that\nSaid I think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that surround us you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give you an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experience some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm\nAs we've been trained to believe you realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional when I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a sin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them yes\nAnd but you can experience that
