thousand and two children was four dollars announced near it cost to production we predicted she'll would rise to thirty dollars announced within ten years people thought we were absolutely nuts nine years later silver hit forty eight dollars an hour and we weren't so nuts anymore\nNo not at all so what made you so sure that the price was going to make such a big move\nAll at the time silver was trading near its production costs an industrial demand was absolutely skyrocketing\nAnd why do you think a hundred dollar silver is possible now\nShore in fact China alone is expected to need an amount of silvery equal to half of the global annual mining production that's just China the whole world is moving to China just recently California's now requiring all new homes to have solar panels there's just not enough silver supply that kind of demand\nSo we're going to see a shortage Kevin\nAll I can say is that some smart people like J. P. Morgan has accumulated the largest private stockpile of physical silver in the world more than a hundred and thirty million ounces that's over two billion dollars worth of silver I'm sure they're not doing it because they expect the price\nDown the hall I guess not but could super reach higher than a hundred dollars announced or if you adjusted for us\n... George Silver would have to be about a hundred and thirty dollars announced to reach its all time high so we think's a one hundred dollars is well within reach\n... when that happened over the next seven to ten years but we believe most of the games will happen over the next three to five years just hard to ignore the potential in silver right now\nKevin our listeners are passionate you have anything that you can set out to listeners so they can find out more about a hundred dollar Schober\nWe do George or not make a special offer for you it's our latest sky high silver report listeners can learn more about China's massive move into solar and why experts the silver rising to a hundred dollars announce\nThe reporter the twenty dollar value but it's free for your listeners by calling one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nFolks this last week even for just came out with a report saying China was leading the way with solar and that in two thousand Eighteen global investments in the solar will outstrip cool gas nuclear combined\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution goal now to get your copy it's a twenty dollar value free with no obligation go one eight hundred\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\nSeven Daniel full floor and yard sales going on now with incredible deals the lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to\nFifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents get would look limited flooring all an seal up to forty percent off\n... finished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nNow since we video on demand TV channel completely devoted to the best movies on us lose inches conspiracies suppressing science it's called us ... all access us we'll be all access is now living in the Amazon ... apple\nGroomed as us ... dot com and download the ... to play and I do go to us will\nNot common subscribing now for universal access at Brussels devices us on TV all access trusted for over Twenty years\nIn a recent national survey sixty percent of all households reported to their families are in homes are not prepared for acts of terrorism civil unrest born natural disasters are you ready\nHow do you know the real Joyce's opposed to being some some ...\nYeah but you know it's very very hard to tell the difference it's very strange I Can't really differentiate what's real and what it is and\nBecause the the the frauds are very good at what they do\nThat's the thing and you know what I watch shows on TV like about uh how magicians are filling in public and I say this is so bad because it's so good at this and it makes all of us who are legitimate look really really bad\nAnd it looks like we're all doing trickery of some ... I'll tell you if you have a psychic reading you should not you should not ask the person who's receiving their reading\nAny questions I shouldn't say well you know it's your mother's name or anything like that why you hear you should be able to tell them that's the first test of legitimacy of what you are receiving\nThe iron ore yellow or on a few days ago I heard it in the great guy and I I Believe he's got these powers are others who\nAre critical of him say that he's just a great magician and and I told him I says hurry I got to tell you if you're a magician\nAnd you're doing this would sleight of hand you've got to be the best there ever was because I said we can't see how you been those spoons magically you if you're a magician I Can't see the trick\nOr you know we're we're you do the switch or anything like that ah I've looked at videos I've slowed them down a gun frame by frame\nYou can't catch the guy I think he's the real deal\nI think he's probably the real deal ... I Believe he started out doing magic tricks has many of these wonderful psychics do they start out doing simple magic tricks and then it ethically from there as a there are six cents kicks in and they start to weigh it legitimately\nAnd then it kinda well close together you can't tell the difference\nBut it's wonderful that you're you're slowing down frames and did you learn anything from that we were able to\n... you know what I just learned that the guy's guts powers but a lot of us have that ability to generate some of those similar kinds of power she was starting up watches and blocks haven't started in years\n[laughter] to to say that when you were growing up you did magic tricks or you're involved with magic\nAnd did a little magic when I was kid um you know was ... I was really good at that but you know I dabble with that I had a lot of body experience when I was eleven which really I think steered me\nInto the field that I Know I just wanted answers to all these unusual strange things and they're still unusual and strange for me Joyce\n[laughter] yes I Know but you you're really amazing because I find that most people are so skeptical and you spend so much energy trying to convince people are really saying something that will really be impressed and they'll say well I was a trick I it was a visiting a Web site last night that I thought was terrific\nAnd there there were some uh doubters who had captions over the whole thing saying this is obviously fraudulent\nAnd those are people I Believe who will not allow themselves to move out of out of the third dimensional way of thinking that's so restrictive and limiting now into higher consciousness go into fourth dimension fifth and beyond\nLet's all move forward and it's the people who are very mired in a monetary and ah other um financial interests or very earthy that will not leave that dimension and that's really a shame because the earth is supposed to be in growing in a consciousness so they're kind of a\nDigging their heels and it's like a little bit of resistance\nYeah you do now Georgia we take calls next hour what do you need from our callers was you know birth

the heck out of bed she didn't go in the elevator and the elevators the cable staff and the people died\nCasey [laughter] oh my God [noise]\nAbsolutely George reminder\nAnd just psychic where do you get your ... power where you get it from\nI I don't think his power I oh God that ... where it really is distracting yeah a lot of people say that and I think on the guy has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely free to call in I'm very happy to her\nAnd that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's our life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath so the energy and staffer all of us to use and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to this show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that that animal passes on\nThat's a great question our connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine\n[laughter] I don't want you to worry about me\nAnd when I lost my dog he came to me and a little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that your mother so\nAnimals and that's your question George Will either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go but they do\nHave a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a two wonderful dimension but\nUh I I don't want people to think that two sides that right you're supposed to go when you're supposed to go and you know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\nGeorge Burns\nYes don't do it [laughter] I\nKnow you asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have that ability to ...\nA feeling of the threat class sent you a sense and you're feeling that's very intuitive so you can feel the presence or like when you're with in there or field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive so if you're with the person who is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche\nVampires but they're not necessarily bad people they just have a ... dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories where they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but\nI get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's a terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energy which is really extraordinary so that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... day in year and then I just want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate Joyce\nSure that'll be great however you run a charge that\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris uh been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so ... ten sixteen so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity\nYou have a question Chris oh I'm\nVery much a creature routine and I just wanted to see if their routines and our break his routine can get boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area's not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and uh do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\n[noise] um I'm a I used to I I Do some writing now yes\nWell you have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up with details when you paint you should be painting again that's very therapeutic the press\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough now ... so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for\nCalling it did you have a question no that was there but thank you very much\nTime on science Chris in Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine is their Joyce\nNo but you know what sometimes can become really really discouraged and you say they have to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want to do like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy so and change your life and try prayer and meditation they know what I'm really stuck and bring me something fresh and somebody know unfair it will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them psychic abilities\nSure uh not only that but what the new website was starting which I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all of my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's\nTwenty four seven lines so you can call in\nTo the ... got a question for you in Canada and the international line I David go ahead\nYou're more than a very good lady um passed away last Monday the this oh designers they lived December six feet Nineteen forty seven and then he was a ... okay well you might be able to\nHave to tell you she thought very highly of you and you know she puts a handout on your Dave and she says Dave\nI'm fine and she's also thanking you did you help her to cross over to help her before she passed\nA law was not\nThere are other than his friends there with her she's a\nShe's a very generously she had a very good heart and she said thank you for saying that she thinks she thanking your day so you must have been\nPretty pretty nice to her saying she was the greatest one of the greatest before I can tell her energy is extraordinary\nVery good heart center is\nKind you could ask for anything she would do anything for anyone but\nTaken at different from that yourself you very much like that you have a very good hurt yourself and don't create for her she's saying look I'm Dave I'm fine\nYou know Jewish we're not going to escape that that'll that'll probably not going to happen to all of us are hopefully leaders in sooner [laughter] but ah use or anything people can do to kind of mentally prepare themselves for this ... this trip yeah\nDon't be afraid and know that you're never alone even if you go through the tunnel that follows the physical ... even then you're not alone you have always you always have an angel or a guide with you and then when you cross over to the other side it's fabulous\nYou created by people you know it's a big party and those of us who left here are grieving somewhere probably you know

G. S. T.\n\n\nThan welcome back to coast to coast George ... with you Robert boss was with us almost three years to the ... this day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school back to dreaming is original\nSince this is a modern dream work with the ancient shut Monica mystical practices for journey into the rooms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including three you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network\nA noted the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGood debate dreaming weaving with your joys\nLooking forward to this ... this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell first of all my mother took me from Melbourne, Australia where we are living west distributed to see her on the upper figure and the psychic medium of mean caliber\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned when she saw that she didn't tell us she went up room came back like face well she was right that when they had major when my father had been transferred to the straight an army officer\nI got pneumonia and I died and how do the old my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they look to get and they said oh you boy died and they came back so that\nThat is one of the experiences of my life and gold and the stuff that goes into the new book I must tell you to do is I don't remember anything much from what happened when I was out of my body a three hour members rubber are living under the afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\nWhereas I died again pronounced dead again on the ... the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room and that time I remember what happened it sounds like the ... empty to begin with up onto the field and looking at the the the the the scalpel in the ... not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to live in a park or some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride go some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I didn't know that goes straight maybe I'm drawn into another world and we're I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that rather than I forget that I've got a\nBuddy in hospital bed back eventually opt to seeming\nTo live a whole life of Ninety yeah so so and I'm shocked to find myself in the body as a kid and I know the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding there will be on the physical you know nine years old who do you talk about this you try to talk it out that the medication\nYou're hallucinating or something\nThe first person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes with the same\nAnd sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings my goal dissociation was the buildup to eat the travel beyond the buddy traveling consciousness without psychedelic club drugs quite easily and an understanding of the world beyond the physical and they are the people\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell on the phone not alone in little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army so moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mind ... companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and a big face\nBecome and sit on my that is the backup Robin you know you're going to make it through you'll survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know go and they'll like you and one day all day you can't kill your dreams are easier right now people want to hear you that\nGeorge was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and help him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe are time travel is in our dreams and when we develop the odds of conscious corrective treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in the right time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a why is the self who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality\nInto other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example but we're leading parallel lives this isn't as weird as at some science\nTells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you and I live in right now they want to many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know that for now dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from other living right now on may be radically different so that's part of what dream traveling mainstream traveling also means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding that solar consciousness survive physical test so this is a pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dreamed travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as little bubble up from the U.S no subconscious not sold that's going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who come cooling those people to come calling my enclosed glued but loving family members are ancestors a spiritual guy some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get out that we get the on the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes them down will notice that they dream of events before they happen as one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead\nBut we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about our connections with drama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods\nIn the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to the U.S hand understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the power of direct experiences papa dream travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who work with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually be on the old and remind this is one of the reasons why\nMost human ... human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or got us if you like\nBut you can talk to nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest cells so we might be lacking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams can be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from Baton and more objective perspective than we can manage for ourselves an indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what that might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience have lost the sense of a deep up to ... percent of that by began to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully a live human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning now Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we remember something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I

getting on a plane somewhere and I actually say when I arrive at the airport I don't actually need a news story today because the best stories sometimes up when something goes wrong I really just what the mood trip her\nBut you know at lunchtime I sit down at the airport by have a beer on the straight and not have the uh when I can\nSee me read paste man next to me as you looked like a fellow would like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting he looks at me and he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nYeah I was in a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name on the headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it's her but I cold\nShe'd never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to head ... he says what do you think of that I said it's a great story it's a very great story I mean that introduces whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my call them to something called us to a certain place might even be an age and the ...\nAnd let's see but as I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the attitude of the energy you're carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking foot waiting fuel round the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so drop the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important that the first of all I mean scientists telling us there was no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind not into we at every tuning every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter of reality as a dense conscious so\n... there's no hope of separating mind and that they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the body has its own messages his discovery is that the phenomenon but used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize\nWhat is going on the body reacts to something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high\nThere's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits the gusher in my blood is boating and it's\nLike you're living in tents and after\nThat I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland beat the white queen ... the white queen screams\nBefore she ... she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing I had a reaction in my high blood pressure to do that before it took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific\nProof of a sudden the phenomena and pre sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly report if people think I was looted you\nWell you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know thing\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough\nAbout it you know so medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people\nAnd we feel what they're feeling in our body as well so that's about the story\nNow you teach active dreaming what exactly is that Robert\nWell acted dreaming is a way of getting active with dreams and the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guidance in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of looser dreaming you'd call it shut medical use of dreaming we ... my favorite way up and talking on the loose and treatment venture\nIs to start out lucid in state ... what does that need it means that we use shut many drumming in the workshops\nAnd we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay this romance an adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff that stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and facing the scary based on its own ground it might mean\nI Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic looser dreamy another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that risky try like state\nTreating sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where we are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like a tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes that will come to you the pool to loosen dreaming and finally\nActive dreaming of the method is also about treatment with your eyes wide open we got the how to look to criticize the outlook for signs and symbols in the world around you so this is also a program and the method of attending to the dream like symbols of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams themselves misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminder to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves to ever deceptive\nI mean we can pick up things in the night of the problems with the floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias\nThat that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of health of healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scary you know worrying you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you a kind of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about to be very misleading\nYou got a rubber we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue chatting about your latest work mysterious realities\nFind out more about
