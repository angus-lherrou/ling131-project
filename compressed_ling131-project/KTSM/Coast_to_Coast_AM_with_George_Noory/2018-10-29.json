and some of them like lizard man I remember reporting blizzard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as story you tell when this book about something called the wind man this is a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland forest land\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be too hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know that'd be coming out his window areas where it seems every fit in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post and somebody it's saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of ... in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them have and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have the spy too weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nI tell people if I don't have on says I'll tell them\nYou know they said that she's a ... or ... or or possibility um\nYou know I'm not going to tell people that big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of the moon\nWhich I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not seen again and just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four in Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my room there\nOn the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed um he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road and it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings but it was kind of Harry as well [noise] excuse me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like ... ...\nAnd um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing five books now I'm On this phenomena foreign the men in black and one of the women in black\nAnd I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and say I'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies that typically are described as looking\nYou know go on and the skins live white white um\nUm people talk about how vaccines have this ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them before they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after paper being using wage of bullets which puts another angle to its\nUm but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's portrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a\nYou know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this the ... street it's fall be on you know just guys in a black suits\nYou know I guess\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with cattle mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters or that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we're going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction wild but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the cat will be a ... you know you got a really weird and actually a couple of some which apps to explain but with the men in black but you know in some cases I think\nGovernment agencies are responsible for me and my paper I think it's a very small gotcha great the January unexplained and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIt over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words it

that our government the u._k. government other governments around the world would what time and resources into not only investigation of these phenomena UFOs things of that sort of healing abductions but would monitor intimidate\nFollow a alien abductees whether or not the government understands what would you in the ducks and they're all about that idea with the ... too many but you make the case in this book that it's real and ongoing right\nYes I mean the reason why I wrote the book which actually the official publication diabetes the first to November but people can already got it [noise]\nBut um the the reason I wrote top secret I mean abduction falls is because over the years I've collected a number of official documents on abductions which will be declassified through the ... in the ... um the u._s. and finally I was in a position where\nI could actually sort of put the book together and you know provide the rate that we've yes it's another book on Eileen abductions bus instead of going just overall ground you know\nWind up present paper with the guy just showing how falls would be put together now I'll start the book actually with the contract a movement\nOf the Nineteen fifties which preceded they abduction phenomena by just over about ten years or so and the reason I did that was to demonstrate to people from the would go so to speak\nBut um government agencies do ah put together falls unpaid who claimed to have had I Lived in Kansas for example just about all of the ... of the Nineteen fifties like Georgia ... George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls opened on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI but yes like ... there and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or government is very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George Hans hassles FBI file 'em is extremely expensive it's like about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm ... was about four to and so on\nSo you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape people now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with a bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess is the defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but it was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn fool around his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get waited a they don't fail writes the you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft where they can be strange creatures\nAnd they subjected to a stranger and intrusive experiments now what's particularly intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around the ... Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning it back to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nOn this they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon with a new holiday what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they reported it to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused cold day a promise to the security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond if you like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the ... it talks about how the the the they promised them security services interviewed Ronald Wildman of ... to with the with the cops came to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes that he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time angle of abduction low in today's world but Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO coming down\nWent out of his vehicle and then he kind of fell to be strange checked his watch and there was something about ... it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think\nYou know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject than thinking sort of amused meant well there there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking them literally but when you realize that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nI ... it makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers of landed published in the early fifties that\nThat sold him huge figures of gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em on and have a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a call me and this type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file honor dams skate um\nPredominantly because he was someone yes talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with aliens\nBusts the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by the communist angle and um\nI'm grateful we could afford our son surgery nervous but now we can't really afford food\nDaniel from California [noise] choosing whether to pay their rent

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states of consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so\nYeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's the sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about their death experiences and and the experiences and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies religious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world and popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how of belief in church or a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest in spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remains strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began the book with this puzzle you know the problem which is\nYou know people still in America seem to have a lot of I guess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America\nUm believe in and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say a participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about how can we talk about this you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust sense of belief and\nOther world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTrying to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and I think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about\nInfinity a or thinking about the the multi first with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves and the Braves with ... with a sense of odd mystery in and wonder\nI think of those concepts are sort of the sea bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's um and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to ignore me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah a pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other reality um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is um I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of well what what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about\nThat and maybe I can just say worried about that for them for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm going to\nAnother ... the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm sin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and on science I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talks about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space but different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw a line on a piece of paper or a line of one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flat square on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide and then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction um or a fourth dimension\nAnd this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and the the something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others some philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really on the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that\nThey find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler more elegant um um and so on so and in fact just skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um\nYou still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise] uh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these

story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds developed a through by personalizing it you'd tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own heads around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story yeah\nYeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the um you know sort of like a habit being raised religious and a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his mayhem\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality um hinted into an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think as his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nScientific ideas that we can talk about if you want to how he does it but he has a has a set of scientific ideas that he that he uses to think about how this might be possible how could the dreaming self be able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I've had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happen a than happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality\nAnd then they come back to this one side of the audio what how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of the experiences as well so in that chapter six um\nAnd then a little bit in the chapter on cs Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's the the famous writer of wrinkle in time\nJust recently a movie made a vat of that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my president could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing we have this kind of intuitive sense that time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that of the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of\nLimitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist so um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe I'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the the laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you can also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia\nHe wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of the questions that you as a professor religious studies talk all the time\nYeah you're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how free or are we to make choices um and so on\nHum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that you know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe\nOr or makes it possible that you know maybe the dream itself it somehow ... above our\nThree dimensional world or the world right to free spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension\nDreaming fell out of that block universe peek into future and Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of time here and a bit of you know and then and higher space last for their um that's what he believed dreaming conscious had an additional\nA degree of additional direction [noise]\nUm and we could talk about that as a specialty match or we could talk about that is\nThat maybe consciousness somehow can move with additional degree of freedom and everybody everybody so history of freedom and you also believe that everyone if they got the journal by the bed of their dreams and a couple of recommendations for your dream job\nBelieve that everyone would be able to see that all all of our dreams future events and I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there are people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that are those topics as well as near death experiences what to talk about second chances are shopping remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we've discussed on this program before like fit into our discussion of other world so the book spirituality and the search for invisible

uh summer hired mentioned being reaches down and grabbed somebody from ... them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab us should pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimension and what's in them\nYou certainly have had you know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years say things just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that in in a an Abbott spoken flat land so\nYes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever I'm as higher dimensional um and as I was kind of higher dimensional objects that are the sorts themselves into our world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying the science and religion could coexist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people in the story so I have\nYou know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also have scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret\nWhat's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider and tuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like the all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set of discourse is that we used to talk about to talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like jaded up you've done right who had these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein you know he went to\nHe went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I Try to make in the books I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concept um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know a remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to\nTo reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm reaching for something else reaching beyond our own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to\nTo reach 'em transcendence but prayer meditation absolutely there are all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project your consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that does that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a ...\n... ... has higher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a lengthy than wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in ... and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and\nAnd what do you see well if you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled off of his two dimensional world\nUp into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension analogy of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly\nA he suddenly has powers of vision that he never had right he can look down at flat line he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside ride it say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle\n'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the tri leading the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have used to say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right wing raised to hire dimension we look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out you know you could see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of everyone's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision\nUm and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talked about having this kind of um having this kind of special vision where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and then the epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents Paris psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in uh oh yeah I was in an interview to just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people have had and trying to put it in context that this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his book to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book um I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book in the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land as as a character you know as a character that suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um you know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and others talk about being able to see\nLike in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience in a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so once again another case in which\nUm you know you you were raised into a higher spatial dimension and then you can suddenly have this these incredible powers a vision that you didn't have

because light changes and you move and you have faces and\nAnd people and cultures and hair styles and it's just lovely have you ever tried the flashing exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise] and actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditation on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um\nYeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try next to this suggested that dollar

plural formed also occurs in chapter eleven so there are dimensions out there uh the Bible talks about them as being the unseen\nAnd also there's other worlds populated with intelligent life so I mean

well I'm just saying that you know you want to practice prayer is a very good form of meditation and uh we're promised an axe to Seventeen that God will open up our eyes and will prompt aside despair will move upon all ... all religions\nAll right but thank you I appreciate the call appreciate it we're going east of the Rockies uh dug in New Jersey I doubt\nThat morning how are you this evening [noise] good what's on your mind\nOr is it was very is there a new wave hit a practice or maybe there's something you do before you go to sleep to help you um uh out who are prepared to uh uh be able to remember these dreams or how to ah make them more loose it\nI don't know that so I don't know Christmas is a Christmas tried that has any expertise but we'll ask him\nYeah there I mean done in his book I'm On dreams\nDoesn't really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know\nSay things like you know talk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details as you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrienne Adrienne sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said\nUm you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so that that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talk about um dream and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is the first for me from volcano California the caller is Brendan got good morning Brennan\nMorning with on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so I keep having these episodes where I'm\nI'm I'm I'm just a little tidbit I'm suffering from saw me and so when I get on these rules but I don't sleep\nFor his second day very well it seems like after about five or six days of this but I get on this trip or on falling asleep on my body is falling asleep in my in my mind's awake and I guess they call it sleep process but\nIt's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always deems that icy and usually are trying to get me and pulled me out of my body and not only that\nI can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious on what your thoughts are on is this just hallucinate it you know my solution eighty and like\nYour Internet or wicked PTO will say that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is in I'm able to actually I don't want to say teleport but you know something along that lines into that because it's very scary actually yeah yeah yeah\nRight yep I recall you\nRented let's let's let's Christopher respond thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well you mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seem I thought I heard him say consulting doctors are we compete in\nThere there is a category of sleep route and there are there are things that happened when people are falling asleep or waking up and sleep route thing is it's scary it's a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise] you know and it can I think I Believe that can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so\nYou know get the question is you know is is merely a
