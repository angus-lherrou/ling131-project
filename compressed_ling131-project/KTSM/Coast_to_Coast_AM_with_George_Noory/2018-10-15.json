imagine this country imagine some of the fallout and what about three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate\nOne consequence of that will be there will not be any federal judge has confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years and won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely and the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty they will not come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer think about that and the impact that would have on your life and my life\nBecause CNN and the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening to Leslie stall and sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to run\nAnd I can dent in twenty sixteen\nThe only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president and America would not be right now\nMourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate crack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I\nWe wouldn't have any of that stuff going on and so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in\nUh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races that will determine whether or not the Democratic party will invest\nYeah eight or whether the Republican Party will legislate just think about two to six years ever having no federal judge has confirmed anywhere\nAt the Democratic party touch the U.S Senate they will shut down completely they will not work with this president to anything done including criminal justice reformer reforming marijuana laws whatever it might be the president is on the precipice\nAnd twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty sixteen it was a joke\nAnd so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington that the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful\nCompared to the next two years at the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that's what we're going through the past two years the fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs seeing the ss drunk and you note and I know\nSo if you're in one of those a contested congressional districts whether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep the house in the hands\nOf ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be\nAnd especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that it's so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is going to destroy Kanye West mode because the

there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... thinks well there's two things who's there\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast amateur take history there there are a list of papers on the right hand side the current neighbor is the one that is on the town\nNow with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an elegant which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls his waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner bought\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks how rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and ah originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid was not completed there was a they say there was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researchers proposes is Robert ... father John ... vow and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in costs me gloom uh his brother vote to attend and he sees in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek a and of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\nUm\nDoes it every ten steps that every ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of what you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you were you just you know\nWell mine that I thought they were just a applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egyptian Egyptians designed pyramids with something called they called ... which is a purely dangle\nA and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount forward and that's how it could step charged a pyramid angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know just steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's no regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course you know I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do was bases inside\nAnd we'll get to that or after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that is with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in a shape to block interview I I think I said that uh Belmont a ... I'm sure a shock to an effect we published that al ... was disappearing or during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a case in a big dip her\nIt was a star Morocco\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation it so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper\nAnd why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south uh orientation\nI got to jump in right there the coast to coast and we got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get\nDaily Show updates right to your inbox for free was the ... letter signed up to the coast to coast am dot com [noise]\nThanking them\nDown and find\nThem funny [laughter]\n\n\nWell I'm not in Egypt [noise]\nMethod you do me a cat moving in with the new human took a little getting used to ... ... she likes to play like this giant sat there she met my face I sweated away she takes it in my face I flooded the way it's almost like she thinks I enjoy\nSeeing how much fun she gets out of it well I Can't make more than\n... a person is the best thing to happen too much out there that ... percent adopt ... by the council and they started my project that are\nHard to seven nine six four or five\nThat's P R O U D to seven nine six four or five\nStar to your online MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W.

showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a which we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm On this thing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks is twenty three some of these peaks a or a specific Lee noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nAnd I'm a and those are also listed and it turns out that those courses that are associated with these round fractious tend to run\nA over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen a chamber\nAnd based on this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know courses that have a surface area that is around ... number fraction of twenty fifth\nI Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid where we don't know of any spaces and work but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not ten\nNow we're going to get to that ... ... exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right but then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking at one two three four five six seven eight\nAbsolute definitive uh marks\nOn these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example course number Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth or Nineteen twenty fifth that aligns with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a question I'm thirty four also it has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight a we have eight twenty fifth\nOr and that goes across a feeling of the um off the ground at tower\nI'm now there are there are two courses nine twenty fifth and and twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers in fact the tower\nUm and and then the final point I wanted to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be role eighty four\nNo row eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly I\nYeah you are it's not the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be a you know within the resolution of this scanned that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the book the big boys\nI got it yes yes of\nCourse we don't know exactly which is it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know painted that into this illustrations just to give a rough guy\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from ...\nYeah and and he says does ah does my new see any connection between a dynastic Egypt she didn't use of the lion and the use of the lion at\nGo back lead tabby and everybody's talking about go Beckley tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is there a connection\nYeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd weak constantly land at ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic event the end of the ice age the construction of go back a tabby the erosion on the banks all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yet which makes go Beckley happy not an accident\nNo within references of course with lines to as low extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak with authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great

Thomas Manu\n... thank you for taking my call Manu ... search you know my question as we have the subplot tomorrow and the pyramids the banks have there been any\nIntention to reconstruct the original boring a key subplot to do and I know that sounds radical\nBut for example the great pyramid is missing the capstone and it just seems to me that\nYou could bring in architects archaeologist perhaps what specialties a\nRemote viewing into an intuition and actually reconstruct the temples repair the temples half that's been discussed\nYes and as it was a great question I'm so there's two answers to that the first one is that uh the minister of antiquities is trying to partially restored a monument so you get a feel for what it may have looked 'em but they don't want to cover it up all with you know modern\nReconstruction they just want to give you a sort of an idea so they may may they may do a section\nAnd then they leave the rest on touched\nSo that's the first part of your question but there is something even more exciting going on and I have to reference a a Harvard uh it's called digital visa and what they're doing and this is on the direction of Peter\nI'm a new alien um they are basically recreating he's a a a ... of in the in the\nVirtual world and I predict in a few years you'll be able to uh descend into a virtual world and it will be exactly like the way it looked or the way we think it looked and you'd be able to go into all the chamber's look at the inscriptions and\nIt'll feel like you know uh the real thing and they're working on\nNow with these additional chambers in the upper half of the great pyramid I where did you come up with the number six or eight\nRight so because we have we have a sequence of ah courses that conform to this uh you know the simple\nRules at the surface area is around fraction of twenty fifth\nAnd so and I am pretty convinced that they that the architect wouldn't just waste I'm you know energy to create these sticker courses unless there is a purpose for it so for every single of course that has a round fraction of twenty fifth I think there is a space associated with that\nMore and more phone call before the break let's go to let's go out west to Daniel in eureka California Daniel you're next on coast\nHi um I had a quick question about the\nUh selling he'll watch uh I've heard him many times interviewed on coast to coast over the years and yes apparently he controlled and very closely guarded access to researchers in the public or or to the pyramids in for research and uh just general public access\nAnd I had heard that after the um spring Arab Spring uprising or he resigned what is access like now with the new minister and our researchers are given better access for research in the general public and I'll take my answer off the air\nGreen question Daniel my new what's it like there now with you\nRegarding doctor how 'bout so first of all I had a few email exchanges with him and he's been always very nice very courteous as just the questions and so I've had good experiences with him I've never met in\nOf course and then you probably don't know why I'm I'm regarding getting a hermit so we are currently applying for a permit um for a small study Robert Robert shock and I are on and I think I'm hearing mixed messages on the one hand it's also like investigators are being invited to come\nOn and on the other hand I'm hearing is that the uh they've become more selective so you know it probably depends on the project they have certain areas where they want research to happen and other areas they feel like it's a it's been exhausted\nUm you know so it's really in their hands and stuff and you can do about it other than you just try it and what they do\nWell do you think that the the ... research would be ongoing like it is it ... yeah how was she was a job of director there\nI think he is actually involved a Jimmy he's on the he sits on the on the uh the board of directors that reviews the data so he is involved or these not maybe not publicly but behind the scenes he's involved the opposite force by a get input\nUm you know I think they're sort of a mixed back here you know there's the public's eye of a school you know I was on TV and gives announcements and then there's the the scientists the archaeologist who loves what he does um you know it's difficult to kind of sort it all out but\nI think um you know they they have to strike a balance between protecting the monuments and allowing people to research done and I to be honest with you I understand it and you know some of the projects that are you know you want to do you can't do them because it might destroy the monument so I'm\nWell you're being you're being said some political right now and I understand that might do it and I respect that yeah but there's the other part of this where we have been told for so long that there is nothing to discover there\nAnd that they have not moved from that stance and now it looks like it's going completely in the opposite direction that is why are they gonna have to open right are they going to have to back pedal\nYeah so to the to the listener's question I think I forgot was Daniel I think right yes\nUm yeah so I think what you said because they love and so I think that has something has changed uh they're sort of a you know people are even Egypt causes that talked to some of some of the scholars there the local scholars they feel like you know they have more of a voice that can you know\nA fair that can research and I think it's been I think it's been good for a country and I think it's\nGood let me jump in right there I knew I got to take a quick network break this was coast to coast am more by new when we come

morning\nHere in Southern California my new or the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique welcome\nA numerically that is not not in writing but in in the language of mathematics um and it's not complicated math it's actually some of the features that Jimmy and I have talked about and some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you know we don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think is the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website and one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino\nAnd do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTraits meaning\nThat's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah um\nI I assume there would be a couple of things that do you know referencing your one would be size in orientation or to true north in may be uh something astrological ah with the non linemen\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain it\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it well\nLet me help you with this idea\nWhen we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras\n'em and believes at the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top but could there be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYet as well I think so I think that could be that there could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a drop off ... vow has provoked pose that the summit of the great pyramid was not at peak was basically a virtual top and a\nIt would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that's here is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even to hear a clip I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in the Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter pumpkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to her media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove it I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined at roe one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be maybe no more than five feet something like that five feet by hide I'm saying right\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and it would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the last year was from the queen chamber so I think in order to check the spaces you have to put the place up in a uh in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber will the new one scan show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stocked up um they could\nBe you know like the one for example I mentioned that\nUh Rudolph gumption bring a suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do it you mean by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who Donnan buyer investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nYou know the north east corner right\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern the different chambers that made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seems like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the wage throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know that you have to pay the people to experiment I'm guessing multiple million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive\nA project or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to things and hope to things that is a kind of money that will need for a project like\nThis is coast to coast am I supposed to be church it's been an all

Jay DSM [noise]\n\n\nAlright welcome back to the coast to coast and beautiful Monday morning here in Southern California\nAnd like I said my favorite thing to research my favorite is lost history and Egypt and our guest tonight my new save side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramid\nA dot com and the links to that are over ed coast to coast am now minute before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seemed to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly than what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we had that ah example of it but it was going on for a year she was the last pharaoh need to be four she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned as a last week on my other show fade to black\nWhich is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time and more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah I ... as Graham Hancock a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive tour of some of these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with Charlton Heston of you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has an Asia and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with a with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go to the wild card is going to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy Europe next on coast\n... oh I'm okay with me and he can ... ... hope that that can and cannot\nWhere did you find suitable for all that when our\nCredit he had heart in my room ... like\nA ... ... ah\nHe kind of ... ... ... in it that way it is harder hit than not in mind and whew I'm\nLocated here in the ... the I think when they can then maybe you could recreate the mom model if they were like at\nA port ... hit hit these kids are you know found and maybe something like ... they had in mind but he never ran that getting ready to get in there you know it it while you have to think\nOh you're talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember how we can get built on their effects then they go get confused when his father her and you know the kind of life that they're at the end but and she had in mind in June went nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits would get lost\nIn there and get them right now I Know that and it it really is and you can\nAnd maybe they ... you know they wanted the oil because they do that and have a rat\nAnd maybe that's a great they ran their gender or oh I don't live in a concert there for a long time than getting out that\nMaybe\nDorothy Dorothy I'm going to jump in and and and say that you are on the something my new and I have talked about this the\nThe blocks in their rooms in side of the great pyramid our acoustic lead tuned then they resonate and a while many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty\nWhich resonates through out the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nClare right and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago\nUm I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory makes has room for the you know extra space is purely he may say yes\nI'm a so I could because it because of these residences engine oil electromagnetic energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or the other answer about ... you were talking about the spirits of the kings so I you know sort of the same vein I I think\nSo first of all the Egyptians did make rooms\nFor spirits of the king and for a bit to receive offerings basically so we know that just stare at a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed and\nUh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold um and ah him you know you ask about him you know so he you know or his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptians believed\nThat uh uh you know that ah just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members with the friends\nGreat call somebody let's go west of the Rockies to Garret up in Portland, Oregon Garrett welcome to go well\nHey the Matty great to have you on board um I have a question about\nThings yes All right so about a year ago

village a ... you know as a southern ... or where mark leaner has been a excavating a they find actually workers that have a they broke a bone and it was splendid\nI'm so they were performing ... you know surgeries are on on these workers when they injure themselves which goes to show\nThat they were not being abused or they were probably voluntary workers and ah they were being well fed and they were being taken care of so um yes the lifespan was definitely shorter than ours but\nThere are if you look at if you go to Cairo Museum UC statues of people there were definitely the older than thirty or forty look at hand me a little statue you know the person that I think designed the great pyramid\nUm he probably had diabetes from the looks of it and he was kind of heavy set you know he probably had a ... in the legs but ah to me he looks maybe fifties maybe even sixties\nYou know so it's kind of depends\nOne last call let's go to Mike in St Peters Missouri last call of the night Mike welcome\nOh hi always wondering the pyramid itself that we see their goal is that all of it or is there like another mile underground you know that just like the tip of the iceberg\nThere you go my new is the ... well aside from the the sending passage way to the lower chamber is any of that pyramid underground\nOr as ... I'm Sorry it was the question again he's he's asking if the pyramid is actually the tip of the iceberg\nAh okay that's a great question so I'm a you know one way to marry\nThe the the theory of a lost civilizations starting something in ... uh and then the old kingdom are Egyptians of a building on top of it is basically to draw the line exactly where you are asking a Michael I think micro is your name right yes\nSo um yeah so I think ... and in fact when even when you look on on the pyramid itself on the ... on the north east corner I I was there just a few weeks ago and you know what that is bedrock\nThat's not human stone that is actually the original hill that was there and it was molded to sort of you know allow for stores to be placed on it but you're looking at something that was there before the pyramid was built\nAnd so it is possible that there was some structure there before and in fact Robert Duvall has insinuate it is that he thinks that maybe there were shrines on the in this three locations and they were lying to you know the bell SARS for Ryan a dating to step peppy\nAnd then you know in the old kingdom are Egyptians came they basically built their pyramids on top of the shrines and so uh and\nSo what's the pyramid also you know this subterranean chamber from the looks of it it looks much older and when you walk into the pyramid or you walk into the what's called the kinks chamber\nThere's also a you feel like you are you are basically in a to phase monument like there was something there before and then the chairman was built on top so it's an excellent question I'm hoping it is a little bit difficult of course but uh it's definitely be something that's also\nThank you so much my new or just an absolutely perfect fascinating conversation tonight here on coast yeah I loved\nIt so much to me we've got a twenty seconds left what's next for you\n[noise] um [noise] what are your ... one of your listeners exactly the right question about the connection between Quebec early tippy end in Egypt and that's what's next\nAnd there's no doubt that there's a connection I there is a seven thousand year gap in there and we're going to fill it in and with your help thank you so much Manu they safe out there\nWhat a conversation tonight this is what coast to coast is all about for me is being able to come in here and disgust my favorite thing which is lost history and Egypt well of course time travel ghost UFOs all of that stuff counts too but for me it is Egypt and loss history\nAnd with that I got to get out of here\nSo I'll see everybody here in a couple of weeks but before I Do that I've got to think Nathan for running the\nBoard of course Donald behind the glass Chris for being the producer for me here ...
