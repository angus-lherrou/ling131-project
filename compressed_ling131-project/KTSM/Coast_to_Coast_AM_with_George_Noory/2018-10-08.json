[laughter] and I know that that that sounds\nA bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology on going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that plays turned out to be here is if the one [noise]\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada\nAnd um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas in area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nI'm much stronger but at the same time you're defending perhaps all earthlings from some kind of outside potential for invasion\nAnd I think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would have destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving them to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here\nThese beings that ancient alien a theorists talk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel [noise] um if they they come back and they want to and slave us again because a lot of people\nBelieve especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit to global suicide\nIn other words and again I told you this was going to be dark what if a lot of these governments actually have some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back\nAnd put you know colors on us and and work us like animals\nWe hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the\nCase so do stay button basically\nAnd and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan\nI'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made a one of his speeches I Believe it might have been before the un jumped in what if there was an alien threat [laughter]\nYou know what did he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed

there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but there may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order\nCompletely um outmaneuvered anything that we can and so once we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps preventing that maybe now we humans are experimenting with some stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating affect\nAh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back on their place\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth this is going to be my final wishing machine

year on October thirty first it originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Saddam Hussein when people would light bonfires and work costumes to ward off ghosts\nAnd the evening before was known as all Hallows eve and then later Halloween there's an interesting Josh [noise] [noise] yeah\nIt absolutely is I mean did it goes back thousands of years\nAnd um I I think Fallon was the original pronunciation and they would talk about this being a period of time with them or\nThey were oh you know reaping the reward the harvest but preparing for the call the month of winter and so they believe that as the world was sort of transitioning into a ...\nWhole dead time that there was a period where the the bill\nWas so thin in fact the Europeans often talk about what they call thin places the boundary was so thin between where we are and where the spirits are that we could encounter each other for at least one or two nights and ... and interact with each other\nAnd the good part was well some of your loved ones might come through but then they're also all of these creepy evil being through and so you'd you'd wear a mask\nSo do you blend in with the evil ones and they'd be like oh you're one of us\nYou know and and they they wouldn't harm you but from a more um I I think updated point of view George this also happens to be the time of year when a here in our part of the world\nThe earth is shifting away from the sun and so uh that means not only does it get colder and darker as we tilt into that mysterious back a black void of space\nBut furthermore uh we are not being as a strongly bombarded\nBy the the radiation coming from the sun and therefore subtle things\nThat might otherwise have been sort of drowned out in the noise of the sons radiation could pop a little more so for example let's say a I shine a flashlight at towards you outside on a bright sunny day well you're not going to notice that as much as you would if I did it on a dark night\nRight and so what happens in general in there but it's still there it's still there but it's just not as prominent and noticeable so this is\nThe time of year when we shift away from the sun and a lot of these subtle energies electromagnetic electro static and otherwise that are associated with these spirits another paranormal entities are suddenly more distinctive\nAnd a play more of a significant role in in our awareness and of course we're we're also in Hampton this because we're we're paying more attention and we're looking out for it more\nLet's take some calls here with Josh as we continue

and I looked up and it was my uncle had\nJust passed away and and he told me he said\nJohn ... your car and I was shot at it and what to do it again you said John don't value car when\nI was so scared I had to get out of there so I got up late and what he was gone\nBut still I was ... and ... and so I got her at home with a friend of mine and the next morning\nI called my cousin which was the son and it has to wait and ask you a tape it and then bringing my collectively and I get him right back home he shouldn't matter though so he and his girlfriend got my car and took over the cage for them that anyway he a guy in my\nCar when they pull that that ... hit my truck and they they want to but they were extremely you know you could I mean they had ... votes and\nBut I never told me like this and that was really like to see anything that it went to two of my close friends and um I don't let it way than not with the\nShow they have the I guess you know up until now I haven't told\nMe in the in the morning was just not to be in that car as opposed to you driving the\nCar you know well I didn't want to do that and he told me down and\nWhat you didn't carry on to them no no no that was the idea\nThat they would be and you get my car but they were ... they weren't killed but that was the only time I ever had it in like a safe steroids ghost you get all the same thing as for CNN\nJosh why does spirits come across like that in warn you\nYeah well you know John ... thank you for that that's a great call and it I Believe represents one of the most interesting aspects of the spiritual realm [noise]\nYou know scientist who are the smartest folks who among us right now who are uh you know the astrophysicist a cosmologist a quantum physicist they're telling us\nThat we have the mathematical models we have the experimental data to prove that all time is happening at once at least on this particular time line that the past the president and the future are all happening at once the problem is that we humans are\nSpirits in the material world it's like the song by the police\nAnd so when you are spirit trapped here in this material body you're only able to process what's happening on the timeline little by little a minute by minute hour by hour a day by day week by week and so on\nBut once you are no longer in this body it seems like you're able to have an awareness of things that extend far beyond what we physical or physically incarnate as humans call the presents\nAnd so it would make perfect sense that if you have a loved one\nEspecially one who has recently passed into the spiritual realm\nThat person may be astounded by the fact that he or she can now see the future to a degree that you cannot\nOr it might almost be like comparing the perspective of an app to the ... to the perspective of an eagle\nAh they're both physical beings but they just have a different point of view and then when the eagles way up high he can see the storms that are coming that the aunt can't see that there is more sensitive to what's happening I'm On a lower level so anyway all that said your relatives or friends or loved ones who Passover my\nDefinitely be able to see beyond the scope of the temporary situation and see somewhat into the future and that would certainly be great motivation for them to come and give you a warning and in this a case drawn and it seems

still does ...\nYeah yeah I mean I I haven't seen him in a while now but Robert I think really became famous or some would say infamous as Robert\nBecause that a lot of people were sort of a chiding him and uh I don't want to use the word abusing him but basically there they were taking them out and cathartic Lee releasing their pent up frustrations on him\nAnd it was when the shock wave of curses and bad luck started hitting all those people that suddenly word began to spread like okay this dog here and you know\nRobert was winding back\nYeah and it's because of that that um he I Believe now is so famous because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you\nIt has to be respectful people now take it seriously and I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace and I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know

so I I just got off work at eleven thirty ... and I was in the ... and the Katie hospital a log in\nAnd I'm cleaning and I'm often it's called the day room you know where the ... people come they do their activities and all of a sudden I say this\nWill nine year old boy I Would say maybe ten eloquently I couldn't seem directly straight you know just that core I perfectly\nAnd he's looking at me and I start off and they continue mop like okay this kind of eerie any pushing pretty hard and so I was wondering\nIt seems like since I've been working there for about a month like you think it's maybe around October is that we're in the spirit to really\nShow theirselves and he wasn't supposed to be there was he\nI I don't think so I talked to see in a in a couple of the nurses and they told me that they\nEveryone who goes in there by their cell or maybe two or three people they feel like someone watching them and I was just wondering might huh Josh or what do you guys think\n'cause like it seems to me is October 'cause it's not a full moon because it's full moon I can tell you what it gets really crazy around the hospital for whatever reason\n... do you know a little boy died there\nYou know I asked them and they sent from what we understand no owned have died there but they said we don't know a full history\nWhile he's in hospital where do you think Josh\nWe'll call thank you for that call and yes I think that this time of year has more prominent paranormal activity for at least three reasons\nReason number one goes back to when I was saying earlier in the show about the earth tilting away from the sun and subtle energy fields being\nMagnified or at least being more perceptive ... so that's that's number one number two is that here again in our part of the world in the northern hemisphere\nMost places have\nA colder drier environment and I know that's certainly the case in Utah\nSo that means there is a larger build up of electro static charges so when you lay down at night and you pull your sheets up you might see those little blue sparks flying around the similar to when you're drag your socks on the carpet and touched the door knob\nAnd there is a definite relationship between enhanced electro static charge and the ability for paranormal phenomenon to materialize and interact\nOr in my laboratory over the years I've been able to reproduce many of the things\nThat people talk about when they encounter the paranormal using electrodes data charges such as creating a luminous life forms making objects move without any visible source or creating the sensation of a cold spot or a cold wind where they call an eye on when\nI'm making your hair stand on end these are all things that you can do artificially with electro static charge and yet\nWhen you go to these places where people are often experiencing extreme paranormal phenomena you find that there are these very strong electro static anomalies in the area so there's some connection there\nRegarding how that the non physical realm of the spiritual might be able to temporarily interact with the physical realm and that reminds me of how something like a magnet has this invisible filled around that that creates a physical effect but then the third and final point of course is that this\nTime of year we're talking about it more I mean you go to the store\nYou see all of these things that remind you of the paranormal spooky the afterlife you see it all on TV you see the movies coming out and so you combine those three things together and certainly it means that again at least here in the United states\nThis is the time of year when we have the higher likelihood of experiencing something go sleep spooky creepy paranormal or at very least metaphysical\nAnd Josh don't you get energized during this time of the year for some reason\n[noise] well I Do and I think you know part of it goes back to the fact that you know I was born this month and so you know that's always been a time a celebration my mom and dad have always been fantastic people have always been a really cool arranging nice things for me and growing up in western North Carolina\nEspecially of Asheville when when the leaves are splashed with color and everybody that becoming very festive um it's a great reflection of that original celebrate tore mood\nFrom the old world in fact so many people of Scots Irish descent came into the mountains of western North Carolina because they found them familiar\nThat ah I every single genealogist I've ever talked to says there are more people of for example Scottish dissent\nIn North Carolina then there are in Scotland and uh we should remember that the very first attempt\nAt an English Settlement was in North Carolina on the coast at a place called Roanoke Island\nAnd they all vanished so we now know that today is one of the history of the greatest mystery the ah last colony and so I was born in the area that had um an enormous amount of influence\nFrom the early you know Scots Irish who originated these ideas about celebrating fell on and Halloween and so that combined with my birthday makes me very excited and I'm sure contributed to the fact that uh I Love this time of year\nThirty seconds or give us your ability to get more and more time\nOr I go to Joshua pie Warren dot com has no period after the beep Joshua would be Warren

was with us a couple of months ago with Richard talking about some haunted rock and roll that\nWas a classic mad welcome back to the program\nThank you very much for having\nMe on very background hot as a journalist get involved in the unusual in the paranormal\n[noise] well the simple answer was I was born that way\nOn Halloween or yeah yeah oh happy birthday coming up\nYeah thank you very much so that really kind of started my interest in it I don't ever remember a time where I ...\nIsn't interested in ghost stories horror movies and the like so I just learned uh I I never really wrote about it until I started to work as a reporter\nAnd uh every Halloween I Would try to write a a a feature story a Halloween feature story and so I started to write a story about um local ghosts legends around the area where I was born\nAnd ah the reaction to that story was so overwhelming that I thought well there's really something here and so since then I've I've combined my interest in history and folklore and go stories and just kind of combined them altogether\nDid your birthday cut into Halloween or didn't Halloween cut into your birthday when you\nKnow it it sort of a made my birthday ex financial I refer to it as the season of Matt now\nI Love it kicking off the year I Love this quarter October November December it's it is the best absolutely in how did you get your interest in World War two\nWell after I wrote you know I wrote three books about a music in the supernatural and at a certain point I wanted to uh find another project to to place with my publisher and initially I thought I I I'm you know to be completely transparent I consider myself more of a civil war geek\nUm but I started to look around at writing a civil war book but what I've found is that there's just so many so much good stuff out there already\nA and that people have compiled a numerous books so I didn't think I could really add anything to that area of ah of ghost stories in the supernatural so I just started I turn towards a World War two uh and started to uh research whether there were any good stories and\nAnd sure enough there were there were plenty of good stories that I could compile in a way that I I like to do it I like to do I like to couple ghost stories with\nYou know tales of secret in cities and and forty entails so a hunted World War two it turned in to be just a really a deep area for me to explore and that's that's kind of what I like to do\nAny harm to the world war two were these ghost stories and events from World war one that overlapped in the world war two or with these things happening during the second war\nSo most of the stories that I I compile our stories from World war two not between the wars\nAnd and they occur they continue to occur believe it or not\nWhat creates the difference between these kinds of ghost stories I Would call the military on things as opposed to regular guy\n[noise] that that's a that's a great question because um [noise] you know\nMost of the stories that I wrote about before a university goes stories haunted rock and roll ghost stories of country music there was there sort of a light hearted aspect of those stories compared to what I found myself into when I started to research the world war two go slower\nUm and I think when you're dealing with war and warriors and victims of of atrocities and\nWorld War two probably set a new standard and violence and atrocities so there is a deep seriousness about the material and I really want to honor the sacrifices especially from the soldiers and sailors Marines\nUh you know when you're dealing with this these acts of Vail valor on on Normandy and\nYou know all of those stories you want to make sure that your your ah honoring or what they they brought or the other thing that I found a little different when I started to research hunted World War two was that\nUm [noise]\nYou know you want to make sure that you get the history right I'm history serves as a backdrop for a lot of these stories and I think go stories are are one way that people help preserve the past\nBut sometimes they're not perfect in history so what I found myself doing is a lot of times is is uh finding these ghost stories and then trying to confirm to make sure that history was correct\nA you know I've been I've never looked for whether I'm a ... or was available to German troops enormous during the Normandy invasion but\nYou know I found myself looking looking at those types of details so I think those are two reasons why the these stories are a lot different from the stories that I worked on before\nWhat isn't Matthew about the battlefield that seems to enhance the stories in and they could be anywhere they could be I had um a friend who just once a little big corn oh we're accustomed to less than was\nAnd you know he's convinced that's haunted to Gettysburg Reno was wanted right I'm sure there are other battlefields that are but what is it about war\nThat creates these hunting visit because sadly enough these Soldiers Die so suddenly and they just still hang around what what's going on there\nYeah there there are a lot of theories about why battlefield seemed to attract these ... more so than than other places um [noise] in their ... essentially is two camps on this so you have on one hand you have the paranormal theorists\nAnd they said that this in in one case a they say that this violence and trauma of war ah causes these\nUm\nAlmost in the event almost in beds itself in time and space it gets repeated over and over so that kind of explains what they would consider residual ... now on the other hand there there are some a theorist that also say that you know\nThe shock of war happens so quick that maybe people have a hard time transitioning maybe their spirits have a hard time transitioning from one plant to the next that's that's the other theory now there's a whole skeptical side of this too and what the skeptics would suggest is that\nBecause these areas are profoundly moving emotionally when you talk about the sacrifice when you talk about\nThe death and the tragedy that it raises your consciousness that maybe you mistake normal uh activity normal phenomena for paranormal phenomena so those seem to be the main theories behind why these battlefields are so hard and\nIs there a specific battlefield that you would say is the most ...\n[noise] I think the consensus wise I Would say a Normandy is extremely haunted um there's just doesn't stories\nAre especially and it might be because there are a lot of tourists are that are visiting that area and so a lot of this tourists are documenting what happens but the\nBunkers the fortifications are seem to be haunted one of the stories that I found a particularly interesting was that a a father and daughter visited the battlefield\nAnd that's part of France for people who don't know where it is\nRight yeah Normandy, France uh and uh the the father and the daughter visited the Normandy beaches and we're exploring some of the fortifications and went into a bunker\nAnd when the daughter and and father said that when they came out of the bunkers they they didn't really talk too much about it but then later\nThe daughter said that when she was in there she saw these figures are these people actually in the bunker somewhere laying down somewhere looking out the window and then she started to describe their uniforms and the father who was a World War two buff\nImmediately ... ah recognize these uniforms is German uniforms\nAnd later he decided he wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away\nThen later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw and he claims that she had no access to any\nIn World War two history books she ... he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom ... and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle of the bulge\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen pitches

I didn't want to leave our our sailors out\nNo nine years maybe for me so let's not leave aside well\nYeah I'm going to make sure I have those in there so\nThe interesting thing about uh after World War two was you had these battleships\nYou had ... ah aircraft carriers and they were engaged in so many activities so much a honor that ah those sailors served in that it was a shame to just got all them or to reduce them to scrap but luckily for us a lot of\nPeople got into preserving those um ships those aircraft carriers and his battleships\nAs living museums and they brought him back to different ports and and also when they brought him back to these ports they brought a lot of a ghost stories with them and and some of the ones that I collected the USS Yorktown which is now in Charleston Harbor\nUm there's a lot of activity or a witness their shadow figure is probably one of the one sitcom shadow ed and ed stands for enemy designated which was a World War two term for when you come in contact with the enemy\nOr there's some pretty dramatic stories of ghost hunters chasing the shadow creature around the uh the carrier USS Hornet I think is probably one of the most documented a ship base a haunted sites\nAre there there is a story about a man dressed in white naval uniform who uh wanders around the deck some of the battle ship the USS North Carolina I worked with a few a paranormal investigator from Port city paranormal\nAnd they basically told me they they have a career documenting the ... on there\nUm and of course we mentioned USS Arizona all of those uh and there there are a lot more I was finding them even as a I was starting to publish this book so yeah there are a lot of World War two ships are haunted and I'm just glad that they preserved um and have him back here ghosts and all\nJust an amazing series of events that have been happening that seemed to all of a similarity in that has to do with tragedy mhm for some reason tragedy makes these ghosts or whatever we want to call them hang around don't you think\n[noise] yeah I mean absolutely that seems to be the one common element\nOf uh you know I'll say not just the ghosts of World War two but uh when you talk about haunted rock and roll which I investigated and even some of the ghost stories of\nOf country these tragedies just seem to linger it's like either the spirit doesn't want to let go uh somehow this is a interaction between consciousness of reality or maybe they were just so primed\nUm to to when we hear these tragedies to maybe hope that that uh the spirits go on or the spiritual anger there's probably a lot of different reasons for that those are just some of the ones that I've come across\nOur special guest of course is Matthew Swain we're going to take calls next hour with him stories and questions of course and uh let's get into when we come back also after the break Matthew a little bit of your haunted rock and roll stories those are those are

I came away with is the thought that music is really just to consciousness raising tool it's used in just about every religious service are out there it's also\nA key part of a lot of um historical movements like the civil rights movement there's something special about music that I Believe raises the consciousness\nOf both the listener and and the musician that I think makes either people more open\nTo things like the supernatural the cult or maybe a you know actually can kind of promote these these types of powers in these types of of uh visions so that's really the theme that kind of runs through all of those book in my opinion\nWell that's pretty dramatic stuff and like we were talking earlier the current rock stars that have faded haven't shown up yet but they will I think eventually don't you\n... yeah I sometimes this is a matter of what I find is that it's a matter of\nThese stories in these tales in the supernatural usually start out than to than musician to musician\nA person the witnesses it talks to another friend and then for me it usually bubbles up on line and blog posts and then uh newspapers will investigate I'll look into it goes counters will be attracted to the site so it takes a while I'm I'm Still waiting for some good stories about David Bowie for example\nJames Dean of course died young in a car accident and was in his car chopped up into little pieces and they saw all the parts and apparently they were haunted\n[noise] yeah that's a ... ... the name of his car yeah he um he\nHad a car was a poor spider was involved in Iraq and then\nA pieces of it because it was really a race car um pieces of it were salvaged and I know there's one story about I'm a ... a one race car driver used a piece in his car and a car fell on him and I think crushed him to death\nBelieve it or not there's a parallel to that in the haunted World War two book there was a\nI think it was a beat twenty four that crash landed in the desert of North Africa pieces of it were recovered a veteran now in the national I think air force a museum\nA and pieces of that plane were report it to be cursed in that uh I think some of the pieces went went into a\nA a a plane that later crashed I think a couple of planes crashed based on and so so there is a connection\nAll right let's take some calls here for you Matthew let's pick it up by going to Frank in Hollywood, Maryland again is starting in any Frank\nI'll be back with you when you made any subject India I\nI I I think you had to pay some hard things at the uh uh and not the Nazi Germany but what about\nA place where people were murdered by by not see a\n...
