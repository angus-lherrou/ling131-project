power of the press\nOr there was a time in us history not even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch\nSomebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird or white or black Lynch mob justice is the opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this was the same reason that love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime\nIs allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime\nBefore death I interviewed I'm a true crime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or to fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the ...\nAnd not run for your life\nOr all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell in the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric journalists need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards\nBearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of crimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly the majority of the blame rests on the trigger finger of today's shooter\nBut take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind you'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up only a small\nPercentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media would be focused on what isn't just conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about up people who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStave victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talked about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve but the night and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood group say a B o and whatever\nIt is the um uh\nThe uh vi Nineteen twelve people didn't know that uh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had been achieved that had begun to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and I had a very infant pile stage\nMentioned the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer tracking this story than required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find\nA lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person that ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes\nWe were ... except for the end of the the the the last year at the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose\nFrom in Nineteen eleven uh Nineteen twelve which would runner and while he was killing a lot of people but\nThe earlier crimes we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced to have started this in Nineteen alive and there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them now\nGetting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got ... nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that\nFirst year so successfully\nDumb luck and it is not all I'm a ... I had told my daughter that ... if\nYou walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that\nBecause I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime bucks for very off of a serial murder when he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all the times he will be ... in the seventies he'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes\nAnd he would cover his tracks so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston\nIs first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered it in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it and it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points\nThat first murder matches up with against the eye out with uh with with all the last last murders and the series so uh we\nJust luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but we found a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes\nOr the prototype crushed right he and he modeled ... he he perfected that crime than excessively after that it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were sometimes there were guns involved\nIn all likelihood was carrying a gun all the time after about Nineteen oh five [noise] the ah\nThink that he while he used an ax who committed murders there are I think three crimes in which the man of the house\nWas shot before he was heading the head with an axe my belief is that he had a pistol stuck in his pocket or in his belt or something that he would use if somebody was awake and could front of him but um it was not what he was trying to do but it's why he would do if you had to do\nA lot to get back to some of the aspects of these crimes coming up next our but before I Do ... ... ... what did you hope to learn about\nThe human condition about people about crime what was it that you thought you were going to learn when you went into researching and and being the first one to ... all these crimes together to determine you've you've found demand from the train\n[noise] they ... the general answer the question is the crime stories are fascinating to us because they they come from\nThe parts of our of ourselves that we don't like to talk about a crime stories are about lost and greed and anger and hatred and all the things that are part of you and me I don't know you but\nThey they are part of everybody that I've had the pleasure of knowing and and yet we we don't like to talk about them so\nWe covered them up crime stories expose those parts of ourselves that we are ashamed of the uh\nUh that's that's the general answer to why I'm obsessive reader crime but by the way at the last book I read what the real crime it with the real world leader\nA it's a book by um that's why it's a\nWay to Weinstein I could have a lifetime\nOr the or I think I just screwed up her name I'm Sorry you\nKnow there surely going to be it\nAnd and one of the things I learned from reading that is the ... or ... or was a an avid reader of crime stores\nUh Charles Dickens was going to have him at an avid reader of crime stories or a Henry Fielding what it's it's very common among writers to be avid reader so story was avid readers of crime stories because uh ... what I just\nTalked about that that they they tell us something about\nYou do get from a church somewhat but the ... you don't get from\nSports to me as I live in the sports world for the most part of the sports world is\nIs about positive people trying to do positive things in general I mean we take a lot of abuse from people who don't understand it but but that is what we are and what we're trying to do with positive people try to positive thing\nIdling hang on to that thought on crime stories that this will pick it up the men from the train discovering most Americans most

night\nYeah the thing that crime stories are very good because they they come from the parts of ourselves but we don't like to talk about you don't normally talk about\nThe man a trend I didn't make a elaborate and thought oh entry into the subject I got hooked like a I was I was a documentary about the murders and all those guys call or go living with a mystery\nAn extremely well done a documentary far above them normal levels of crime documentary\nI was interested in it and it was clear that there was a part of the story that was missing which is that it's relatively ... the ... murders are a part of a serious so I started I was just going to put it on our end to end to trying to learn more about the series but the the our became\nA weak the weak eventually became five or six years or so but I didn't I didn't decide to get into it I just wandered into it\nYou know it shows you a ... you can do you consider this a a true crime book sure yes it is yeah\nYou you know and that's the interesting piece too is that true crime you know the tradition for true crime is I discovered in in my research goes all the way back to execution sermons right sort of shares a similar DNA with American journalism um except that\nIn the case of true crime you know it was the it was the preachers it was the ... circuit riding preachers diminished or is that would come to these towns in on the day and somebody's execution\nAnd they would do a sermon just before the execution then we tried to provide the context for why this person was being executed in wide the community overall would benefit from his or her death\nAnd became\nBecame an important part of trying to understand\nExecutions in America and and this is where when the teachers decided there they used to just print up their sermons and people would snap them up and then you know what this will just sell it for a nickel and so they started to sell their executions sermons and then they would get passed around in these became some of the early bestselling\nTrue crime near and is it it it just feels the same function is what you're doing in in demand from the tree and you're trying to bring in it even though it's a hundred plus years leader\nIn some cases you're trying to bring\nA kind of I'm a ... a kind of healing anyway not that anybody is still alive that was directly involved but for these communities maybe this this lingering sense of some tragedy that it happened maybe some closure\nI'm On a new exactly what happened to their town and how their town was involved are not involved in in the the deaths of somebody that at one point you know were popular members of the community\nUm ... there were just the favorite happened just a few weeks ago I actually got a letter from a man in London england who ah was a\nA a ... his great great aunt had been was one of the victims of crime\nAnd he had always believed that uh uh the man who uh\nWas accused of her murder and was locked up without any evidence for two years before he was released always believe that he had gotten away with it and he said that reading it in my book bag and our book\nThat uh um it wasn't that was not actually what had happened was just a tremendous relief to have that was that was a shock to me I hadn't thought about that\nBut it was it was a shy who said he was tremendously relieved to realize that it was just a a random crime and that this Manhattan actually that that Manhattan actually gotten away with it it was this other fellow at I don't know why it was important to him\nTo go out I understand the understanding that sense it was important to have to know what had happened but you know one guy getting away with it or another guy getting away with it unpunished I've I've I don't know if there's a lot of different but uh it it's still that have that reaction to it\nYou can\nAhead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book them a lot of ... book\nIs about is is that all all ... all good books or church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred\nThey hurt a hundred years ago and uh I grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these\nThat these murders occurred to him\nAnd I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's ... it's sort of equal distance from me and them\nAnd that's one reason that the\nStory was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was one of the ... or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they died terrible bath I'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town\nOr a hundred years ago\nI think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid\nOf journalism and you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling the story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about\nThe atmosphere of the tone for the um the things that people age or the way that houses were constructed or their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St storytelling into journalism context I that's what I really like what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nAnd then there's what is it up and always sticks with me that trait that party or just back there and that has to do with the the taco and the cases taco invented that it\nUh one of them I think it was sock co\n... had an alibi for the time of one of the crime what are the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses\nWho said that on that particular day he was delivering a to his neighbors and an Italian community um a\nPickle deal because pickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but that was conflicting testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because\nYou're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a ... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right now or never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of a crowd of ... of the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nThat it's important to them a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf of a or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nKnow I think that brings us very effectively\n...

[noise]\n\n\n\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so\nSo it goes wrong [laughter] um but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing or you looked at these ah you looked at these murders\nAnd you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nSo somebody who might have grown up in a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship they know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit I'm so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you saved\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to be thanks so I Wonder what\nThis this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate by recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\nWell ... that's ... that there is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was\nA his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um uh again and again and again with more\nAnd some variation but more specimens specificity as it got went along\nSo that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nThe later patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nThat's exactly what you're so what is saying that that's that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr bell or had been the victim of terrible abuse says young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth or he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look\nAnd he said he had suffered terrible abuse and it's a terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] you know the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing the\n... that's what happened um speaks to\nThe age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally which makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done this ... been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation in the book has a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you're going to have no answer you can have a speculative answers up here [noise]\nI wouldn't speculate that he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and\nI'm preparation for the event ... I don't doubt that he had\nCommitted pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I just very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls that he had a a while you have if he had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't that like a nice guy and then he says he with that\nIt is the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was um it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carried\nIt carried a finger pretty open my life so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents drew and about his life\nThe uh uh but I don't think the whole scenario it come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that that's a great point what year had gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which he grew up in yes um and then check what year he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year\nThere had been something which you know he knew he had to get out of ... he had to get out of dodge ... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a pent up thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first release came long before he came to the new world\nBut it was not a nurse's there's a ... because it was not um [noise] it didn't have any charm it was not it was not a ... generally as a charming\nRight motive often well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that it was it was a true cycle a psychopath have no fear ... Eleanor do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this ... and the trade is that from his crime that he was not\nEven not acting and fear he was he was calm and the middle of events that are horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with it or\nThis is probably not that I should have made it this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book and and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in\nTen years or Fifteen and\nGoing to say well here's what the James's miss they missed this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about this this crime and\nIt when that guy Illinois\nAnd uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right but we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research for the\nPhillies moved on in front of the book but various still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's very interesting a Bill James you really take some questions as sure that'd be great okay so we'll give the phone numbers are coming up just a second demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer or you can ask them about the Boston Red Sox would you also so it's quite a bit of a to\nA and I may throw in a strange question about the Boston sprinkler that's been sticking with me up but we'll do all of that after we give me the numbers for you to join the conversation coming up next coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nSign up now for ... zone or free email newsletter get it today at ... am done\n[noise]\n[noise] three\nYears ago making a murderer became less a TV show then a force\nOf nature and did uncover to re injustice in the criminal justice and it was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm Dan O'Donnell I covered this Steven Avery and Brendan daffy trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part two of rebuilding them\nLeaving a murderer is now in the ...

it's just a terrific read very good writer a and a and yet you know until bill\nThere was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned is being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks that there's people out there that do that\nYou know I mean just like even today we don't think about this people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through and a couple of weeks at a\nBill I got a couple of questions the first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence ... like one of the axis\nYeah if I read what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes\nThe ah I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still it's still around and and the has been definitively guide to the to the murders and\nThe uh uh but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right uh you know what this palm will guaranteed by any chance\nNo we don't have disappeared even ... it was never caught my belief is that he probably went back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people but that is speculation and we do not know that for sure\nOkay well that's all I had to take it out you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the world road it how he got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but uh they\nCan for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThey give you that hey you know actually that's a really good question too about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhether what out in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed\nOr if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or\nThe or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs go to the um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working himself into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lotta stocking\nBut ah the just war himself into frame of mind that he could get where I needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know in ... and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you know\nHe was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen a ... and ... and he came into town\nMay no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his criminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so it is his punished crime in the ... crime and Eighteen Ninety eight he did buy a ticket to leave\nThe town and this this led to a trail forming behind him and police followed his where he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad the always\nAlways used at the intersection of two railroad so they were trained came by the middle of night he could just hop on and he wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to we'll road you're less chance a year you'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to compare\nYeah those are the only place you forgot what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered\nNext to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it the the train no longer existed um after like Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter railroads between\nMilwaukee and um Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to to like Green Bay or something or\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after night in a way he started just morally more or less trapping it became a Nineteen Nineteen Nineteen Kenny transition to just\nRunning loose cross the country bought an interesting thing is that he never stole\nMoney that one of the ways you know it's him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about money and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\nYeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a robbery and and it yet you know at the at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and you know drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would it would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell up fingerprints exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crimes he just drop the accent left his buddy fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he would wash the handle they acts in a bucket of water before leaving a fan of crime you did that in ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career they\nAh ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on or see a but it just dropped the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nConnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected him to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that\nThat that still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean if there's any occupation where somebody could watch the next day would be either like firefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up um buying\nBut they all ... among those who did it work as a matter but the only thing there are some of the I think he did at the accidents\nThat he used word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an axe that was found in would pile almost all of the house and I see the murders were uh were houses burn wood I'm times coal\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold\nRight\nWe're being very careful with those now prescription painkillers opioids seen as heroin it's easy to start taking them not so easy to stop\nLast year in America

would probably play through that area and Eighteen Ninety eight\nAh but ah it's cold it's cold a lot of\nThe year and he he didn't he didn't federal ... it would create some crimes up north when it was warm weather but not never been happier limited to the south they uh uh\nThe uh that area is a interesting because it it's always been a hotbed\nOf um [noise] a reformist motion or a movement or\nIt's as you no doubt no a a a a\nOne of the foundation areas of the women's rights movement the uh uh is is that the exact area of upstate New York but also many um religious movements from the banking century actually I'm a native from that part of the country\nI don't know what it has to do with my book but uh it is a very interesting area and I I'd like to know more about it\nYou know there's an argument in true crime that the the ... the ... murders and unjust unsolved\nCrimes like that seep into the soil and then did they tend to also then grow back out again and again which I was from kind of poetic but they're interesting Doug is in New Jersey and goes to goes day in east of the Rockies for Bill James go ahead\nYes good afternoon gentleman a pleasure to speak with the last ... hours of or wherever they show on cable it's called um uh give me a second hair um mysteries in America and they each week they have a different a show about ... among solve something or other\nAnd I'm not sure but the date sounds pretty familiar war or the ... era with this one this was going on\nThere was a hobo camp a in a train yard in Chicago\nAnd a along the shore on this one particular train ride like came in and out of this yard\nUm they had four or five of these ah ... degenerate hobo is that stayed there in the yard that were actually killed and they found out that they were all killed by actresses they were they were chopped up the axes were supposedly taken off of the trains\nAnd there was I Believe a total of five bodies found and um I Believe at one point Eliot Ness when he was first getting in to his position he was asked to go ahead and looks at this and this was one of the things that he had never solved and they said it bothered him greatly total he white\nYou know till he retired do you know if that has anything to do it or are you familiar with that case at all yeah they um uh\nI I I Know exactly what it is not Chicago it's actually a Cleveland the Nineteen thirties I I'm sure that the case you're referring to it it's a Eliot Ness a after the uh what was hired to try to solve a series of a\n... and I'm blanking out on the name by which the yet right is\nSeries is known but they've actually started in Newcastle Pennsylvania Nineteen twenty two and then spread the Cleveland in the Nineteen thirties I wrote about that period of crimes at some length in in a popular crime but that is it's not it's not ... they were\nThey were acts murders they were connected to train the but it's it's twenty\nUh the uh it's twenty five thirty years after the crime that I wrote about it and I it is not connected\nYou know I'm not sure about that here's what I'm I I I I Know the case you speaking of ... and that's what's become the public\nWould have to go to public safety officer or a public safety commissioner of Cleveland after Chicago um and those I thought were murders mostly of women again that they were talking about this as being sort of an American river I'm In the world\nThat they're all man a man and woman ...\nOkay the rest of ... will get very interesting I we have time for John in Long Beach California and then we're going to have to wrap it up or go ahead John\n... thanks I'm not going to go about a nice to see again but the thing [noise] hey a bill the guy in a in Cleveland out here in LA I'm a longtime

used to play to the acts and you said the other guy used the blood and so that would be I guess that'd be something else I guess to want to ask you real quick\nDid they ever have a picture of this guy somebody could have had to if you're given a description of 'em that you know we had newspapers back then you know we had a you know we had a Morse code and tell a type of stuff like that I mean\nThere had been some sort of picture circulated or something of this guy right to the people knew about it later she just\nBurst into and out of town and now whatever I Want to know who he was
