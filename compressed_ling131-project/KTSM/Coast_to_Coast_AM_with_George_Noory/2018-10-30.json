about the population in terms of ... men and women fifty fifty what they're buying is that a market change\nYeah you know in you know what's interesting about the market is a women right now and and I don't know why and no one's paying attention to this but women are about sixty five percent of of the people in college it's sixty five thirty five men women and in the last school it's Seventy thirty I mean think\nAbout really isn't that high on that's a flip flip from Twenty years ago right\nOh yeah I I said let's say you want you you want to hassle of women there so you don't do it but what you have to take into consideration is is that women\nAre going to run things there's there's absolutely no question about that because they are going to be the most educated I mean the glass ceiling has been shattered for a long time but we're starting to see many many more women come into CEO positions\nAnd they're going to want us\nYeah oh excellent and was absolutely excellent ones and and uh\nSo we're we're seeing a major major change in our culture Twenty years from now you won't you won't recognize a commerce you just want because if it's going to be run by women\nUm what's happening with the new generation Z what's in what is that a generation\nZ was born ... being going right now is it's actually a two thousand five to ... thousand twenty four\nSo in that fully there uh but Gen Z is not going to be entirely different then Gen Y ... that they're going to be this the same cyber reliant generation or they won't be as big because the number of parents that they have is is much

well these these ... that they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they can't complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are that I'm hearing about them and I said let's let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be fun to just going to be just like the hippies that everybody hated this as soon as they had to feed\nThemselves and and and face reality I'm In my joke is they became Republicans so\n[laughter] you're gonna get blasted that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but listen here's here's how it works zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative\nSo what you have is you have conservatives at one end of the population and you have a um liberals at the other end of the population where we're gaining a liberal every eight seconds because they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying\nSo on and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just here about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me that makes me crazy you know this whole division\nThat we have going on now in our country and it's horrible\nYeah it it troubles me it really does we do not\nIt's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a I mean it looks and I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but when you have a president day takes on a porn star in public and they have a fight on Twitter give me a break\nThat's the problem yeah that's\nAnd that's part of the new technology again did anybody ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nSo that when when when you think of the mind that

in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow if you can't suddenly um you know ... or ... or does it\nDo you do not virus that's for sure no\nSo what you have is is there and it's it's a real number or a five hundred million people at work or five hundred million\nMillion ... here's here's how it works ... any country I don't care if you're if\nEr I'm a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people that make big incomes and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers [noise]\nUh and the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well that will lead cook themselves because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can't support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try and would they do something desperate\nYeah ... ... whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's where I go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people to to feed their system there there are a economy is not going to work period\nNo it's not let's take some calls this hour come rolling in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi jarred jak off your well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you I'm just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war I'm not a ... so all of those politicians that have looked in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian\nBut I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman I wanted to say do things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the foreign star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or try to bring down next man but more importantly that man has can actually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and his wife and\nWe had a president did something so by all it can even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nTrump it's reactionary he doesn't start fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature the second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself businessmen and women don't have time for nonsense\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact\nThat you're saying we need more diplomacy that song if he doesn't win more diplomacy doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him because he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had\nThe audacity to get back up yet on the horse\nI that I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows with than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it doesn't matter about this policy she knows she yes as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get scared as comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things would you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think he did to run the country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet a fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run his business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I Would I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nAnd the thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to comment on do you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nWell but let me let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them smoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in their punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh\nDon't know I think what he has done his dignify but it is the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows\nBanned from the bans formation in the early seventies through their triumphant Nineteen eighty

I said what do you see in\nIn Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do you know that the south is not having children\nThere for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but from some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nThat that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is that even one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on ...\nKing population you can't possible it has to grow so I don't know what's going to happen there with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level\nFertility Michael in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south at West 'cause like Florida is now the third most populous state\nOutbreak in New York state and also seen except become the largest city breaking a Philadelphia people are moving to the warmer weather we're Kenny\n... that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside profiting from the pound demographic shifts ahead we cover every single state if you go from Virginia all the way down to Florida over to ...

first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that\nWell uh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love the show\nOh I'm looking forward to this is who says you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it\n... the paranormal it's been happening to me my whole life it started at age for my first paranormal experiences and Angelica experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then start talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or family members but\nTo students and actually I I teach a class now with the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about the paranormal experiences some of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about UFO experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously uh or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but\nI haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching\n'em to two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\nYou know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal of the paranormal the and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community up of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientists historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo ah to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean rating who's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty\nFive zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of at Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities\nAnd from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's due to all of this ... under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift\nGoing on of of gaining acceptance and I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast himself they're dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just that ah it's just it as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some story so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people uh express their interest in and their support I think it's gonna it's going to spread a lot faster\nWith Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... to tell me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner or because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things\nUh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the ... this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and and the last couple of years that's that has been the the point at which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle and my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a winter time and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on\nAnd I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know and they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep a crime myself to sleep and I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and um between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an angelic presence\n... it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be OK took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's that's\nWhat happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see 'em\nThere's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or by uh\nCapsules may do sports fans of the west I'm here to take you on a journey back to this week in sports history\nLet's start back in

to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nSo there is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know relax yeah we didn't know what it was bruised but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was it yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a verified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is\nAnd it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks

my with my mother and uh she was very psychic and we used to just a regular deck of playing cards when I was a younger a preacher\nA camping on the Oregon Coast we'd have wonderful camping trips\nOn the uh uh Oregon Coast in at night my mom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was\nAnd a wet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the the you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get it a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter a blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it\nNo more yeah he did he said when dad said stop it we had to stop a and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom dealing with that and that she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from it so it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my dad that's how I ended up being a history teacher but I\nThink I got the psychic stuff from my my mom\nDid you have a big split experience\n[noise] I I did uh I well I think it was a I'll tell you this was a ... near Oric which is in northern California and the redwoods highway there and a driving south and\nUh my girlfriend was was asleep in the uh uh in the passenger seat and it was dark and we were driving to you know the big tall trees it's very ...\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit all of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but\nIt was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat and a ... it was just kind of leaning\nInto the truck is we drove by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by\nAnd or the immediately I I I I woke up my girlfriend and I said I I think I just saw big foot and and she ... she said what what are you talking about big what I said well I think I thought I'm going to turn around and go back and then she [laughter] she said no no that's okay just keep dry\nAnd I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later I found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe ... given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking with them that this ...\nThere's been yeah there's been more fighting there than than any other place in in

was the paranormal world just so many different kinds of paranormal stories you had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description tell me about the open casket story yeah the open casket or the title alone we kind of makes you a shipper [laughter]\nWell I grew up in a in a I'm In our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man\nAnd uh we were at his funeral was the first or open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me and as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it\nAll of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was home to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's\nIt's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of uh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at\nMy mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut uh I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it than than the typical you know Norwegian accent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but\nSo I I definitely heard his voice and um\nIt it it was kind of comforting\nIn a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre it would be weird wasn't it yeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was\nVery enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time I I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals just to check everybody out and\nSee what she was there very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal in and of itself that the college let me do it but uh\nWell then you have to fight for\nIt I didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like for college transfer credit but it isn't offered it\nAt the college and I am a a tenured professor there and and I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book\nSo I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nUh younger people and and older people different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it ... they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very\nCurious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks in the course into the course\nUm and uh it it it's been a wonderful experience it really what it what it turns out to be is\nYou know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomena I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe\nIn an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a\nNearby a steak house which will be fun\nA that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be\nWell I'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey uh they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria in a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression of in my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I\n... A M visited by someone who's passed on and I might see an image of them in my mind but not like out in the in the open kind of thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent\nWhat they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or or residuals spirit\nCycle ... the ability to manipulate mind over matter\nHappened to you\n[noise] I was the uh um the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place um the ah I'm\nLiving in an old uh well in an apartment above a gossip house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base and a one night I woke up and I\nI felt like somebody was pulling my legs off to the bed it was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I have to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving and it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah at my wife at the time or her hand mirror a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off\nAnd I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind discussed house this bar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the voting singer I Hope\nWar of the world's a realistic radio dramatization a Martian invasion of earth perhaps as many as a million radio listeners believe that any real Martian invasion was underway\nPanic broke out across the country in New Jersey where the made up story took place terrified civilians jammed highway seeking to escape the alien ... when news of the real life panic leaked into the CBS studio wells went on air as himself to remind listeners that this was just fiction\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy four thirty two year old Mohammed Ali becomes a heavyweight champion of the world for the second time when he knocked out twenty five year old chance George Foreman any H round of the rumble in the jungle seven years before alley had lost his title when the government accused him of draft dodging in the boxing commission took away his license his\nVictory in dire made him only the second dethrone champion\nHistory to regain his belt\nAnd this week in Nineteen Ninety eight nearly four decades after he became the first American to orbit the earth Senator John Glen junior is launched into space again as a payload specialist aboard the space shuttle discovery at Seventy seven years old Glenwood the oldest human ever did travel into space that's your look back at this week in history\nA possible solution to the mortgage crisis it's a pilot program in which some homeowners will have the chance to have their mortgage converted Charles rental agreements they won't on the house anymore but at least they won't have to ...

around twelve I started seeing the earth and the first one I saw and and I do have a question for you Bruce\nOn that real quick the first one I saw I Will never forget because it was completely unexpected\nAnd it was in the doorway when I was getting ready for school it was a cat it was actually half of a cat in the French have a cat dragging itself across the doorway\nWhat was the other half\n... uh well here's what I don't know but it was dragged its legs were going way far out in front of it like dragging itself and it was clear as day and I ... after that\nI actually contacted one

and winds at the YMCA in St Louis I wanted to tell you this George\nI don't know if you remember the YMCA\nWhen I when I went in that way back then there was a\nStairway that was all dark and I shut the door and had all these kids sit on the stairs and I asked this that spirit to shell itself with it look like it's being called that appeared right like on a movie screen or did you have that and\nYeah so I mean many I I once I had a girl I took her in ... it's always better when it's dark I took her in the closet and I spent the night at our house\nAnd I asked them they can and that

left Bruce\nYes she uh she should be very cautious and uh when you when you get into the spiritual mowed the connection I always say something like\nI'm opening up by I use the star trek thing I'm opening up a all hailing frequencies to all good and kind spirits\nAnd with my spirit guides also helped me there are also called gatekeepers to protect to protect me from any negative energy so you have to say that right up front that ... to it it pretty much bumps them out right away or we do have power over them unless we invite them in so you have to be very careful to right up front\nPut you

say what they've done if they committed the biggest demographic\nBlonder and a history of the world with that one child only policies they differ about forty years [noise] so what what they have in effect under forty years old down to about three years old which is like three years ago they they changed the policy like now they're letting their populace have as many kids\nNow they're desperate but uh how's it going to catch up\nNow you can't you can't suddenly um you know they were born babies born is adult\n'cause they're not virus that's for sure\nNo so what you have is is they're missing and it's it's a real number or a five hundred million people at work or five hundred million\nAnd a half million ... here's here's how it works ... any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people [noise]\nThen make big incomes that have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax you mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the ... the starting in about\nTwenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well the bullet cook themselves because they're going to have is actually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've got to support that can't support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that\nCan't support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's where I go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has one and in China's history zero they've never won a war I I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is a they\nDon't have enough people to to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked in the I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian\nBut I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman or I Want to see you things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face she was trying to jump start her career uh um the foreign star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when um the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys yet and all they had was temporarily side tracked\nI'm a booming economy or tried to bring down next man but more importantly that man has kids\nActually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white include and his wife and we had a president did something so by all it can even be talked about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did that if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights\nYou look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature of the second thing I disagree that is sad is that I'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school by it and it but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than the things is that and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business as myself businessmen and women don't have time for non Stein\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting that have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then that and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and so the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy diplomacy doesn't win wars yep home if\nHe doesn't save money we need a businessman\nI voted for him because he said no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity\nTo get back up and get on the horse\nI that I have incredible admiration for people that are fighters in it and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it does that matter about this policy she knows who she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments day not in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things what can you want to jump in\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver toilet a fair market value or even try to get it the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that we're much not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that our country is a republic with the constitution and the constitution works what we have the best country on earth we have the best system on earth\nThe thing that frightens me about it a bit of a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um ah the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nThat will do but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas um a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I\nI don't know I think what he has done his dignify\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nI mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean it was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but you know yeah uh you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how\nA star is born spreading fourth straight weekend in the number two slot picking up fourteen million to give it one
