feeling set on the ... around my hot when I had the ... two and a half months later\nI think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back\nEverybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nWork on them for on people for a while you leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something I\nPractice something called modern actresses and and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel about him and the accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative\nSpirits and so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with the negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free is I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic\nAtheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion wasn't touching anybody anyway this really\nNot necessary there's no such thing as as a distant on a non physical level doesn't matter\nAs long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere you know how to do it and it it's it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from\nMaybe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be dealt with you know sometimes are already in the homes from time to come into the home the\nSense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and\nThey're ripe for attack and so it may be a professional habit we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply cleaner all carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent in something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion I'm not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know a local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I keep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around the stars are planets and there are this universe I said before on on one of my appearances universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you have\nTo know do you go into these exercises with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working with Christians which haunt me all the time even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to everybody\nKnew everybody needs help hold on for more at the ah we're coming up to the top of the hour we're going to come back we'll talk more Jeffries website stark clear dot com his book is called power protection will come back and take your

least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems a depression anger issues on happiness\nAh overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line and being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right\nUsually meaning that there is emotional energy and the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across and damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually been working on them for a long time\nAnd they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up one morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time and I was getting up and ready to work or doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it because it the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so\nAll the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe heaven the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark romas or negative\nVery negative what we might call help and an essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to

to the other side gets off drugs\nSo many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to steal your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time for spirits out\nThere that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead\nAnd doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me\nI work for them my job is to get those things out of their home ... negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy field I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nBut they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore or a physical criminals ... on the couch\nIs he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out when I I just don't have the time I have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy or in a person's energy field of the average person\nNot already everybody's disaster anything they just said negative energy issues and also getting if there is some kind of negative spirit attack not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house or a night or apartment to apartment or condo to ... or ... whatever and getting an auditor fast\nAnd making it works so the family or the individual is safe\nThis is my main concern not are dealing with a negative spirit's\nSister is out there you don't just suddenly clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get rid of them\nGeorge I um I was born with it at first it was really scary 'cause when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing the spirits and you know I'm\nA mom for that get you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to you know two days and all this kind of stop at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started not fifty nine hours started to remember doing is kind of things and half life helping people that to me is the greatest gift I could ever be giving is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they they live at\nYou know it's just great here than say hey thanks Jeffrey but you know the real the reward is I'm feeling better that's what it's all about me\nSure

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreamed that it was a dream and it wasn't a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and so sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all but she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well\nHe can dream soon she hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on 'em\nNo you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened key thank you for that when we got open line calls let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou know and you're okay where are you ah\nI'm I'm I'm I'm a I'm well thank you and I couldn't believe it I saw before I had a I had done a little bit of the ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know\nAnd um and I was in a bone in my life where I didn't really know if God was real or if the devils real all this you know and I started reading the Bible and everything\nAnd then I'm going back to the point when I was out of you know whatever and uh uh as God and I was like ... ... you know your real angels whenever I engage where you go you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe I so I it's probably\n... ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later\nThen what happened when I started in these little things like with people like um beagles like these little spirits and stuff and I'm a well I I think this one guy had three of them\nRight when it seemed like everybody and he had freeing the everything he did he touch was no I mean you have a one like in you know what I'm saying in and then I think it's monkey you didn't have none okay\nNow these kids that you know bits of glass of water without knocking over some breaking it up and told me that he was willing to get an angel [laughter]\nBut he just didn't have it\nAnd um I Believe that it was kind of ... just to show me that you know how it works or whatever you know and then [laughter]\nSo I bought a church in a ... a chemical about it you don't need you know you go to church you know and I'm so we go to church but why would they church I won't eat them and I've started the ... will will be angels like\nIn ... on the church all over the place all\nThe way around it you know a new like there was a state of behind the ...

[noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back Jeffrey share with us we'll get to your calls as well as we talk about demons demonic possession what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago I did a free night and essentially at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgainst for years and years and years you all invitation I finally\nOh they talked me into and I said fine actually stayed over in one of the rooms just beautiful you know and so\nIt was actually set up for a ghost hunters to go in and uh with are quitting and and take a look around and\nEverybody everybody found something people didn't believe in goes had you know when a couple of ... their hair dryer went flying across one of the rooms and I was staying and most haunting room of oh they gave me it was actually the nicest room to but\nThe first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get business cards people on it and I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called the bachelor but very heavy oh she was called the golden rule\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she starts\nMoving up and down maybe a foot really fast right in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I went to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters\nWarning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite me because of all people home negative spirit's just they will it\nJanelle to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and I'm Out four feet above me\nWas the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now I'm used to know spirits can assume any shape they want so I don't react to the ... you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately ... what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard\nReally is I Can't it's grain possible to describe it was not any\nKind of it sounded like some kind of evil lullaby\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in bed woke up and the spirit was was singing hello Patrick ... and I could hear a loud and clear this horrific song slowly and I just I you know ... shot\nUp immediately got up out of my bed and ... it kinda went right back into the wall immediately 'cause I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I did I have no idea how long it had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick I sat up\nImmediately went to the chair sat in my room and he said I Am not going back to sleep in this house now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night uh giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you just have to learn\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh and and to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client and I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely under clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I think you got rid of this thing\nOh is usually right away a you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly times immediately you know it's like you know we\nFeel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone or you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments\nAnd they need a clearing and and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I get that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy for my coworkers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always know what it's subconscious and so people don't know that are getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy you don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run\nNegative spirit and so you know people call me families call me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's a media but I always get a caller an email thanks\nA lot Jeffrey really really helped you know\nVery very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last almost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego were bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things in forty five\nMinutes already five different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on the\nBusiness or a house and so you know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family lore arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirits this attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits and demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd are these are the complaints that I did and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments were lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to its\nOld very beautiful but I mean think of the moon energy dinner elated\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy we generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know a clearing session a forty five minutes first standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nThat's some costs just for you know most all energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nUm George it's always a pleasure I've
