that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean you're focused may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years and focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like ... when you read the articles but when you read the title of it like Ninety percent of the time of the wild man\nAnd I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large and eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic\nIt's convincing that something over the years has been around us\nAnd it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big wild man and giants and sometimes they're the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago when your first year can you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog

in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the fear of\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence they started talking about Bigfoot and they've found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if we you have Twenty years of police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace me no your kids to

[noise]\n\n\n\nWell come back we're talking with David polite us about big wild man and giants the newest book an archive of articles that go way back to sixteen eighty a describing these creatures people ... whatever you want to call them\nAnd before the break David Was explaining how why he and some colleagues had collected a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch him maybe had some personal um observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was it was the best of the best the DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake\nAll of the labs got the same results or was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you can see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA has come back as bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat you could think that you're around and maybe a coyote or bird is right near you when in reality it's going to be them and they have this incredible ability to mimic anything that they want with incredible\nStrength in size and when they said that there another tribe of people\nThis community in the big for world that is very adamant that they're an ape throws this completely off the wall and when you dig deeper in it most Native American tribes in fact probably Ninety nine percent say it's another type of people will try\nAnd this article goes right to that point and nobody was ever written a book before tribal ever brought that out\nAnd when I when I found it\nI I couldn't believe that nobody was talking about it and it it's stunning still that nobody wants to talk about it\nYeah I Wonder what those tribes if they're still around would say about it now\n... years later nine years like\nI can tell you that being around tribes in the mid west and in the west like Harvey and I were it's consistent they still say that it's a type of people\nYou know the descriptions of course as you have noted that the term big what started in Nineteen fifty eight so before then people in other words for it and it and then many or most of the early clippings and stories that you collect did they call them wild man of course I guess that would fit I mean\nThey they're humanoid shape they're out in the forest there Harry\nUm they don't know what else to call them\nSo walks like a man walks up right it doesn't walk bent over and their knuckles aren't dragging on the ground like an ape um\nIf I I always tell people I said well if it's an animal then it's probably going to be found and it's probably going to be identified and you could probably go view and study\nAnd wild man ... that's a different sort of thing it's a different kind of topic the very elusive a ... I don't know anybody that's\nClaimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year so they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how I'd while or giant human bones found\nAnd that's that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions in the articles uh are made me chuckle a little bit because\nThe writers who have no familiar to you but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old a ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I chuckled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some\nRationality to an irrational observation um and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows how how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live in that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that a snake long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundred you had a notation at the bottom that\nSaid maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you've made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary and third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe\nAnd my poor wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church\nWas coming across country on a horse\nAnd he wrote in

bought a ... book on about this but when I was going through it\nI I like to think I'm a mile wide and an inch deep I like to read about different things that could be associated with topics I'm doing research on and what I read this I'm a woman for a while I don't think anybody's ever heard of this\nAnd a book which was a Kickstarter project right um which kind of at the same thing with the UFO

has not been to bump but that that's being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the being is that that that you're you have drawings up and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nOne I did\nWith ah the given one film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet is let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on\nAnd they're caught on camera leaving well Harvey has this innate ability to take the beard off the face she can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Patterson gambling film Harvey took the hair off the

different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah if you were ... and you came here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was a an incident where somebody's campfire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nThey they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like ... five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid\nWho doesn't have much association with fire not a grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that hunters and campers and other things in the woods have seen these things do an unusual things other times or they're seen in a lake playing like kids in the water\nUm it's\nAgain the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes match proportionally a smaller Bigfoot they think well it must be young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans disorder chased him off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big foot that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's conclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought that was involved in these things\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did\nAnd since the four one on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the\nMyth keep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut it's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up so when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious\nIf it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say it it never happened it's a completely phony story so as\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big what the kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children you know there's never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it\nAnd why aren't the names there and if somebody is writing about it than fat\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only do they described them as you know I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context of gay as we use the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nOr policemen credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big for the world that wants to go out and kill one and I don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone\nBut they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nB gets spiritual mom where did

authors are Sarah ... an acclaimed documentary filmmaker one of the world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching the story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nHere in New York\nSarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk and\nAdd to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I sat out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and you fast forward graduated from college and said well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I had spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their storyteller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it [noise]\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have\nAn opportunity to work on an iconic for over two story and all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive flu I get this email from this young filmmaker named Sarah ... well what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that\nI'm being Indianapolis a storyteller she wanted to render the story as a screenplay\nAnd she actually did that she wrote a an eight part miniseries than she pitched it to and major production company and they said hey this is the best thing we stand for others but we only the mini series on\nFoot so you're getting ready for a while she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff though for your family and friends she reached out and and they contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I Am and maybe veterans you didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um [noise]\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so uh my\nJoke is that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in the helper but a eventually over the course of several months we finally\nMet and then ah we agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest and a twenty four and um and then when we did it I guess the project tickets and a half\nSo Sarah where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the people who were key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to\nThinking story or shark story and no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral Brent commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sunk [noise]\nUh I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at Okinawa and he ... he drove a landing a craft from uh the ships took good troops on the shores so of course you know that the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the ... version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped

D before somebody hundreds ... D board somebody\nNews radio DJ DSM\n\n\nSo ... are you interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander ... as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were\nActing out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the commander has tremendous um well it was it and then more sports that he's had wished after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and\nIt was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from men are hashing modus point of view and there was a chapter on is devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military\nUm he went around saying on doors after ... for radar and more technology for his that Marines because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his rather than commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nAnd there was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in that you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of the rescuers that counts because by the time that the rescue arrived the\nMen were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by\nThat point in the story but you know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored because the shark ... attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know how much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling\nThe men from the water the shirts um the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported they were so sick they couldn't walk on their backs you know from shark the shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they could stand on them\nThere's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they go oh there's mood I'll just reached out and grabs a boot right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually\nTook his socks off\nAnd thinking he was going to wiggle his toes as bait to lower the sharks in and catch one [laughter] and then you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter]\nSome of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water they just went completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen rats between there were there were four groups was it three groups that there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case\nThere were four groups of four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day okay that's right so\nSo there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in in the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to\nLose their faculties lose their ability to reason that some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up the torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then other when you know take mall heard is that the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gold thing it like they were hoping it out of a mountain stream\nAnd what happened with this is a condition called hyper ... and\nBlood that food for blood cells hair\nFrom the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their heads and um they died very horrible deaths from drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around you that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh it must have gone away or\nYou couldn't imagine I guess it immediately that it sunk but quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard With Francis and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who would and wounded and you know that the generals up in the cockpit with him and it's the late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see this kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's no report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess it seemed kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yeah the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear a navy personnel at Guam I Believe you know hey I saw this should anyone look into it and they said no there's nothing reported in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know there's actually more to the story with that where you know they had a son who you know this gentleman richer the friends that have passed away but his son carried on a story and you know there\nHe actually had diary entries of the time and at the ... father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he would\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors of the what came next is a equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about tonight's just log on to go to ... am dot com\nFat by\nThose around town lunges\nDo we have\nOver the past fifty years score mentors have helped more than ten million small business owners the for free\nStarting business can be incredibly confusing score really helped me through the course\nWhatever the business there were a mentor and that has the experience to know how to help you reach your goal scorer mentors\nAre serious business experts\nWhether you're a start up or an existing business score can provide the perspective ended by the insurance six that\nMore score mentor them tremendously helpful [noise] mark Martin\nScores a nonprofit organization where we provide free business consulting services to people who want to start a business oriented\nAre you starting or growing in business [noise]\nBe one of the next ten million small businesses helped for free by going to\nGet your free business mentor worn out or [noise]\nNice ... actually it's funny like taking\nTo the doctor when I broke my foot in ballet rehearsal for leaving me alone when I wanted to be alone and now as a grown up I'm thankful\nFor being able to take care of you might hear mom for having the chance to take you to the park for reading you those books we enjoy so much for being able to take you to your therapies empty twisted your ankle for understanding that sometimes you simply want to be alone [noise]\nRules change without us noticing\nAnd in your new rule we help you help\nVisit a A R P dot org slash caregiving to get practical health and wellness to to provide even better care for your loved one\nVisit a A R P dot org slash caregiving or pee wee help you help the public service announcement brought you buy Haiti rpm the outcome some\nState DSM am El Paso his use radio six Ninety and I hardly radio stations news radio six Ninety is Tate GSM am El Paso\nNBC News radio I'm Liz Warner Russia is not at all happy about President Trump's threat to pull out of a decades old nuclear arms treaty\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five and you're listening to news radio six Ninety J. D. as Sam [noise]\n\n\n\nWind Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of dropped through the cracks a that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell as Sarah mentioned there with the\nDeparture methods that didn't go through from gone to the Philippines there was a tenant Philippines I who had received the thing that is\nA ... a combatant ships arrived there didn't need to be a report made well he wasn't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a report saying as much that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrival that shit I guess that means I don't have to report NATO rattles either\nAnd then you know to be fair to the navy\nThe entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combined to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until I pd one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere was a very poignant story you tell when the books or a about these pilots do dropped all the supplies and try to get these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto and they're they can't do any more there are other supplies they have to hit back and there was one guy whose wimpy way up\nIn the middle all by himself to swimming is a I don't know where he was swimming too or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being\nSo terrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left in your plane to help this loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to in a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know our ship or else the VP is the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't fit one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident\nSo the rescue occurred beginning on August second uh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August\nFourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters at times believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men\nOn the very brink of the end of the war\nThere was talk to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but there are families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who is involved and who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame\nAnd a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented this situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral king Bruins limits and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of that area you know we won the war and\nYou know the the American public you know holds these men on this high platforms and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name like I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was\nBrought to cart court marshal there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little let's talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commander in to testify that uh Deborah happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain is that he failed to zigzag exacting could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two churches um and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commander how she might have to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all\nFor having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels son captain Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo glad he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights at the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the specific forces the commander at Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into open court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with McVeigh and so what they charged him with was failure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then heard it passed man demand the second ship as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that ... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across base court\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese ... commander and indeed captain make they did see stick as the ... evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk\nBut standing orders as the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have stuck McVeigh\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference that he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly and\nAvailable on Netflix this week [noise]

when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a who is this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis and you know bill was contacted by the navy\nHe called me and since there they found the ship and I didn't know what he was talking about at four in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nA the ... group which has the vessel that\nWere ... responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts than they were the first one to be successful\nJapan to tell you what Joe that's quite a bit to chew on their let's let them tackle at least the last part of that question a nobody on the ship I mean really no one really knew what it was\nYeah even uh even the cap and didn't know what it was that this with\nThe most closely guarded secret at the entire war and the most highly classified naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh his companion happening games now when it was along to monitor the radiation so\nThere was a little chance that a Japan would've known and I don't know that extra precaution with taken\nBecause they ship with traveling so fast almost at thirty not that they cut it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you note in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it ah element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of funny stories that we are told about what might be in their right to Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this large crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by a marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or scented toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur [laughter] you know [laughter]\nNo one guest anything close to the bottom [laughter]\nYou know I thought it was a um an odd post script sort of the the ship itself got blamed in the court marshal they were a thrashing around to blame somebody in the ships themselves got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect\nBlaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship so they were saying that that was happening they followed that with the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty cruiser at their mentioned she had a single through back that when uh all the way through a from ... stern and\nIn ... in certain cruising conditions in the in the most button that craving conditions the multiplier

what's called yolk modified and not let some of those kids I'm not the old or in other words not water type that when the ... was blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water the with just flowing in three that that a long three attack and so um\nThere were a lot of questions in the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she was open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions\nSome of the families who had last man on the shit I blamed captain McVeigh even keeping that three deck open
