two ways to conquer and slave nation one is by the sword and the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George\nWell the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer 'em\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the taxpayer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money ultimately um comes from the taxpayer who at this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit [noise]\nUh and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a a something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter]\nThere are also fared ...\nFederal um a fruit in lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with a scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway ... ball of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert Lord a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and that every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise]\nUh like many of the state run guaranteed horse in the country um like USA Funds these people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for parents who use child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices truth in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned [noise]\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow\nGo to a private bank guinea private line of credit and do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been\nThey're using their prices\nSo astonishingly much that you know no amount of grants or even state funding cetera can keep up with their budget [noise] um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has no Seventy thousand dollars\nA year well I can guarantee ... per year that's tuition room board books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer takes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened\nWell again the colleges are sitting in the cat burglar shoot they can't because there's this one in programs standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the actual students possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cautious just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane storied where people are graduating with you know a million dollars in debt\n... there was destroyed just recently we're losing a guy walked\nOut of dental school with a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder ... the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and it really hurts the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay off that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is really affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off\nSuch Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not starting businesses Skilling entrepreneurship uh it's really starting to be filled\nAll right we're going to check in with you with phone calls with Ellen Collins when we come back\nIf you've got a student loan give us a call up you've got a question give us a

matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch and I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared mark for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you bite on line and say you know look how great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say\nFor lower income people um you know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans in the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the ... system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy what's what's the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the\nNumber I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three or four\nYears I should have pushed my kids and the sports when they were younger so they didn't get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a good thank you\nI got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big fines they\nThrow at least according to see all day and he looked right at the hold that thought oh\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do a\n... a former company I used to work or I got trained on equality and when a company went under the under the company I'm a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time but ah pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so\nI helped her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone as fast as I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I think also for a couple of years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I think it was a two month course just on well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going unless ... ... dollars on the grades are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that I could have done it for half the price of\nA let's get your reaction to this Alan what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly thank Allen he the one pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages credit curry letting 'em and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that\nForty subsidize the lungs especially the taxpayer on her um it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college dead\nFeeding the New York giants four games to to to date the Yankees won the world series twenty seven times the next closest team at the St Louis cardinals without eleven this week in Nineteen thirty three the Philadelphia Eagles play their first NFL game and we used to the New York giants ... sticks to nothing\nSince then they've met hundreds of Seventy three times ...

it never\nHeard from the company but its current unified document there is a saying in and around consolidation ... read the action program and how can I can turn on right now I'm On a ... based

Jane\nI did I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and so we consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger alone a and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHi George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell tell\nHuh that job thank you and I'm hoping to hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans in the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information is a hundred percent correct the principal was\nSixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listed a breakdown of all of the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I tried to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with these people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a fee\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is none to give other than\nHelping us fight for H. are twenty three sixty six and getting our bankruptcy rates back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with third third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the get alone he'll get a faulted you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a third party closure company like like what you describe it and they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find these are public that clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting to the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to add cost onto the process\nMy friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are zombie loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and ...\nWhen you leave on the line at least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nWell what'd you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent\nThe glee for loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original shine\nPromise not at all at

around that same period yeah yeah that was fun you did a great job they're\nGreat job indeed aliens at the Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nOkay it's essentially it is you don't you mention that I put out to tell the story all leave\nYour credit gram but your life that story and and really to try in one human tree tell as fast as I can story of US government don't want any relationship with the\nPhenomenon or what seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think of them\nThey are hearing the gal that has been the biggest single wherever they are in the UFO community I think that the story that I think comes\nAnd I would say this wouldn't if the vacation and release of the British Government but the the revelation that off two decades have to know the U.S government did have you ever run off and it was run by the secretive defense intelligence\nAgency and they feel that the other day and and like you say Oh yes they said no no since project to close down and we haven't been doing this with no in traffic or no investigation and of course\nThey and that's what I really focused on in in the film aliens at the end again to try to try an angle the numerous threat to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mistreatment all the all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this robot big yellow Senator Harry Reid combed alone I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff neck it 'cause it's coming from all different directions these days\nThink we all of that one is very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely and meticulous detail because I think the problem with the story in one sense for you people have said the\nProblem is that they can do without them we have two little information about what's going on with the story with with\nRevelations or we must have too much information and I think the public I mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just a confusing mess if you if you think back to when the New York times\nWhen they are they a landmark story on this on December sixteenth last\nYear and then the the three videos came out to first than a\nThan a third one but now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this walk strong guy and then this this ... millionaire businessman and and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's\nThat's what I Try to do to take a step back\nAnd and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about film will get a lot in the course tonight then they're going to tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on that one and it was quite a a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and then you've done this of course civilian time yourself you know you sit in the hot seat a direct to kind of\nTalks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and also the question is this when you see the final pro dog sometimes you think wow well you know I've\nGot edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd put that back then and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo they only ends at the Pentagon and what I did this I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script this thing so I scripted the entire movie I did the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and ... in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a a recording studio you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right to it the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Mike along I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final pro dog no one can while I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure\nFrom me and they took completely new role to me I mean there are people of course who are used\nTo this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a a a great movie but um you\nKnow I I was a departure from me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with\nFirstly I as I say really to try to\nTalk through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we've probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field has\nIs it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them\nSo by putting this out as video on demand we go ahead on to the platforms that the young people\nThe watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days\nSo it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google playing food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so the the aim was to take their subjects not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nRan the story I I did ... or you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I wanted to reignite this and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do nowadays like like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you said the organization um he\nRight yes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has said they'd always says in these sorts of situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow are the people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nSecretary of state under President\nAndrew Johnson jumping ahead

I graduated and found myself unemployed underemployed for short amount of time uh and I tried everything I could keep my loans in good stead through to ferment forbearance cetera\nUh but what I fell into and what a probably forty percent of everybody out there was too long as it's falling into\nA is a lineage system that actually want you to fall so they will your paperwork they will give you bad information they'll baffle em bear brutally you and compel your loans to default which is what happened to me in my lungs very quickly doubled or tripled with penalties and interest and\nAnd so I started doing research and what I found was just astonishing uh I took my my ... my findings to first Fortune Magazine a and then I wound up top story on sixty minutes\nA and this was a peace with Leslie stall yeah a a piece for which Sallie Mae and the federal government we used to be it\nYou'd I might add a and so it's sort of snowball from there I\nUnfortunately I thought this was going to be maybe a two or three year project to get you know justice on this matter a but here we are low and behold Thirteen Years later and Congress has not moved one inch\nAnd I'm hopeful that'll change very near future because the numbers have become just so astonishing uh but you know we're going to need a lot of help from the people out there whose lives this is affecting\nWhy isn't Allen that people who have a rough credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments\nSeemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick and by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory are that are geared more for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations in one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll financed them with just what you said they want the default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed and they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more\nAnd with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that that's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's has great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know as far as know breaks what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should or read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know\nUh and this in fact is really what's going on with student loans and particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\n... yeah under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because their credit shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very wrong\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a you know I'm a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the Lenny system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs Raziq crazy what's what's the tuition like at Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse early is probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year and there are even more schools by the way\nUm but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three four\nYears I I should have pushed my kids' sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart\nYeah that's right well you know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know unless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college well\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid fine\nJust go to Joe truck driving in Indiana that get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge high on a\nGood thank you\nI got good news for a man a Trump rally over there and a lot of the other day\nYeah there was a big fines they drop support the seal day and he looked right at the hold that thought oh\n[laughter] I Love it\nBut uh anyway I I I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got trained on egg wildly when a cowardly went under the under the ... the night a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know and it was a sad time for a company pretty much going on there and they laid everybody off\nAnd I was one of those people too so I ended up her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without too\nWell and I said well over ... years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nAnd I looked at the local school there and they want to go to court houses dollars just for oh I think it was a two month course just don't take well you know it's like they're away\nSo I ended up going now unless the thousand dollars on the grades little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got shafted on those I found out that it's not up for about half the price of\nA let's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jacked through the roof or as well you know when you have this landing system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke Texan other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending
