[noise]\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a um is Barbara stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her

was so tiny\nAnd so and I'm I'm start offering because it's like oh my gosh and uh and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who\nIs that and James meets mistake of saying some old time movie actor oh no oh yeah\nYou know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since

eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you\nAnd he looked at me I says why did you put flies in the attic what that has to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to

curse on somebody's life teen years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what it on the idea of energy shopping or something

know and\nYou're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to\nBe away from it was amazing how that

you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local like I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour\nHas friends come over the person I worked with and said hey ah or going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I just spoke\nHated it I thought well now he goes well you might as well get up and move around on it all\nAs otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh like I said it was about\nAn hour away and we got up that direction and\nHung out with people for a little while and\nUh they all wanted to go to a bar probably how no maybe another thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and ah wintertime\nAnd we got out there and I got this real strange feeling after I got into this bar a they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with\nAnd it was just weird it felt like every body in there that was in that bar we're focused on me\nI didn't understand why at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires or something yeah exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter right and up on a rope or something\nYeah and and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place and then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gum CD bar yeah and I went in there with them and to this\nPlace and that was a bunch of old people that there again I felt that often as in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I worked with him um and ah yeah they're to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I had intended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in the car and they finally decided well come on let's go well we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a\nWere off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car and uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no moment um so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help\nOn the house was completely dark and you know I sat in the car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything and I think that was you know\nPart of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening and the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and\nSo I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah are farther art in heaven hallowed be thy name leaders\nAre doing that under my in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I wasn't I I ... a word she says are you pray him\nAnd I says yeah and she goes we'd better\nShe knew him going up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walk up to the house and says any luck you know the telephone nope instead\nAnd I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up and pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb when we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that thought it was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWhich we have these dreams Myers about nothing\nWas going to be stronger than the the like it's in me\nWhat do you

cards in the ...\nWell why would somebody pulled the card if they weren't going to die immediately\n[noise] um well well it's a great question and and my answer is because um as far as the Buddhist

living each moment as if it were your last moment in a way or the only moment is a useful way of re calibrating your mind and so it's a part of reality\nIt's nothing to be afraid of 'em it's not all

I\nDid it on their did it and they knew better right course they will love would call me up to date 'cause she always got her her script you know like three days before the new one right but she as she was good with you she liked to you yeah and she would call me up and she'd go\nYou should see what the haven't made you know I Know [laughter]\nBut yeah no and she she knew that it was the half hour we usually over the top the second half hour they seemed to bring it back down a little bit but it got the information out there even if it wasn't as hokey as they made it\nDid it Dr James van Prague nuts\n[noise] well no because he couldn't see the ones that they were filming what do you mean talking about why not long so\nIt's like the ones I saw\nSo no he was a consultant on the show to are also but he did and\nUh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I'm all\nFor doing a um [noise]\nA something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a missed barber stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the ... they\nAlready are exactly and when she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little whip up I think she was so tiny and so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh\nAnd ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that\nIn James Mates mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's that going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went into the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in the one in the light so I Hope so one of the people that when I get up there she screams\nDo you remember that movie pulled guys in the the little ... little lady kept showing little I don't go home I won't want why did she say that\nI don't know I I had no idea I\nI thought that they possess dirty tricks or some some strange way to get the only change their personality\nI Know they they turned it on a dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like when goes was ... was being shocked for somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that will take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house\nAnd sell it turned out that they knew who the Gulf was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't\nKnow they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important and he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know work on that\nAnd I looked at him and I sort of squint at my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked at me I says why\nDid you put flies in the attic what could that have to do with anything and he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill\nI said flies have nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a ghost person I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that they think it's going to be scary or it should be part of the I don't know where they come up with this stuff\nIs a dangerous Marie I'm to dabble with the other side if you really don't know what you're
