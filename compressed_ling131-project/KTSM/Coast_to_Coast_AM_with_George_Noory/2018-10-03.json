I. dot com call now\nNews radio Ninety DSM [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box tell me about the title for\nSure well that's a that's a book that tells you what's your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over his think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the or the third station the United states is man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations and occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nAnd they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts at seven modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is on the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying this huge sheets of ice falling off the shelves melting away and everything else\nYeah I mean well you know they knew or knew west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about cities that one renewal energy [noise] plus or minus\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar is their intermittent and they can't read if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional nuclear gas or coal\n... when you put in solar wind or you only get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system\nSo if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they were going to triple a the a cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top\nSo this is a hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad the pollution\nActually it's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book you know we talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess\nOn now they are all modern landfills and in Europe in the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a a rats and other room and out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones that I mentioned the carbon monoxide nitric oxide sulfur dioxide our water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use is a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy to use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy and then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a police\nThe point of view not what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is yeah\nIt is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times to one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October in a little thing but it's fairly rare now that the university will invite\nA climate skeptic to climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized and\nDo you get booted\nNo I've never had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and various plausible it man made climate change and we do have a greenhouse effect but it was the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so\nSo a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell she that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles as the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth has dominated by long term cycles called them a lot which cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have a medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that scientists believe the sun causes\nAnd those are the fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when it was very warm\nUm the little ice age in Europe about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there causing the cold weather and our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in the regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycles of the in the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying well water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate would you\nSign up

the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean currents\nOr which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic Indian and the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was\nThat are warming would cause a cause of water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so\nAre there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nMuslim slowing down and really not happening\nThere was a good movie though\n[noise] yeah okay this external thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll act and they'll make you\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\nYeah but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're talking\nAbout landfills when I\nWhen I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind feels that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and there was plenty more boy\nBlue flame you know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas were asking now why go to put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity\nNow come back and they said no no no it's going to cost to my kid have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Want to go why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise] ah they also want to get methane from water\nTreatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh\nUh agriculture um the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment or three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills or but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having stepmom you're stuck into spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy or there is one point that ah other guests

you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few\nOf those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to two point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four hours a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a robbery or\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they were willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's the frosty has told us is this your section thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improved airlines they're doing All right it was out as his boss she will ridge a lot of them are are counting illegally into

but yeah we're not going to go back to the days when most of the world was uninhabited at all for us and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nWould obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there were a\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm uh there are some some um\nIndications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast with historical accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big port [noise] um in in a\nNorthwest Italy is used to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans\nWere higher but again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what they what they think in California\nRoots in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into it I just kind of like a dimension or perhaps to a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and dumb what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time the weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering\nThese are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and even ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections they're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this a lot of sand\nBut harp technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at Emanuel factored why you're not seeing the real no a weather satellite maps that we used to the many years ago we're seeing an animated cartoon\nBut there's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm fronts hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zones coming directly in the California and they're being blocked\nAnd is being blocked by harp technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up they're very powerful I Believe they can play out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can he the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees they can steer hurricane they can stall hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder heads they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial ...\nAffects would have our with our weather ... ones don't hear about it and the new let's get Steve's reaction to the Bruce IQ\nBruce some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to the rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about the climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that's something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he did go ahead [laughter]\nWell let's go man just did it exactly right I'm One of these conservatives it happens to believe\nThat the way to add on is being gay or engineered the camp trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George should recently a gentleman on his show talking about Kim drill team put out a video called Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the blotting out son well people are so much shooting word hate\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said that are going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to earth science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to the street and on the stock market on the water games that they want to intensify the hurricane through the park\nAnd on top of that then you got the geoengineering of the soil and the crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct and if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was a foolish idea didn't man ever come up with a man is not smart enough\nTo harness that kind of power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing I'm proud of him he got us out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant that what they were doing a stripping the oil um industrial nations away distributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd meanwhile China sit there with their sky completely on pollution not paying a dime into it either as Russia but the United states of America was going to quite old guy now I don't blame a Trump one bit I grew in fact I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had to wear out of time

us\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was pulled urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nOr didn't do anything to him but it caught him on a where's and on this particular day he was standing there and the noise the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was rewarded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a\nPines he sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee so he's watching this thing going up and down and thinking to themselves\nWhat on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here now he couldn't cross the river and when the thing\nCame down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it a little in other words there was like low gross ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd when to climb down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and won't position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it\nLowers down again well moments later he sees some ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the fool's\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder of daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess with this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nThat's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened\n[noise] [noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved to the house is a a\nA United sooner aren't and rural areas right\n[noise] ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed up against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story a involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business\nUh these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd Ninety percent of it is uninhabited\nSo when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York\nState and\nSo these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people that had lived there before them well gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven\nWell as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other of losing the gardening tools the wife is saying the husband was to shovel whiz the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together all the tools they have doing inventory and then they were going to keep the moral locked up with the exception of two small hands\nSpades so having accomplished that they realize they were missing some tools and they started\nThey left to hand spades on what she called the the wife pulled the bistro table on the patio and they were using them for plotting plants and no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days\nAnd by and now these hand spades withdrawn [noise] they had actually called the police report depth on the property of you know tools and this and that\nNumber could understand who would come on their land and take tools and take two of them is ridiculous you're going to go to jail for taking a shovel\nYou gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter]\nBright TVs and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods they found one of the shovel leaning on a tree and the wife spoke out nine feet off the ground one of the one\nHand garden trial with a rubber handle on it shoved into the side of a tree nine feet up\nNine feet up so they went back to the out they got a right I guess an iPhone shrimp the pictures of it they brought a ladder out the husband couldn't Bush just thing it was buried under a tree several inches thick couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about funding to shovel in the woods showed the cop shoveling the tree everybody was baffled by you know the turn of events here\nAnyways the long and short of it was the top told them look if you have any of the problem get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to pass it on to the detectives [noise]\nWell\nI had a long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house had been trampled down there for print in the bed or made those were taken the head of lettuce one mash\nAnd whatever had done this which was obviously a big but I kept right over the fence not using the gate there was a gate on the garden and it just kept right over the warrior went in\nAt it's full of feed and unless they recall the the police over the what had happened that what transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had a report every article II of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in their property of walking now so it\nIsn't convincing yeah it's not like it's not like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which\nIs a very odd

D. as them [noise] [noise]\n\n\nOkay\nWell comeback William she and what those William the abominable snowman but yeah the from the Himalayas is that the same as the big for we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of coal to me by all things a Russian professor\nWho was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of this knowledge of things but time nickel\nAnd they formed the unlikely friendship and turn that into\nA hiking partnership they had run across a couple of big for its messing around with some trees are in the woods and they got close enough to them whether they could hear them ...\nAnd the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was on familiar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was on familiar with so when you talk about the the Eddie in uh the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the Bering Sea and it did\nThese things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman or speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard\nA voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing and Minnesota and they talked on a\nThe canoe up on a piece of the lake where they thought the look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while and they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there or they will unseen by them they walk by through the trees\nThey heard them ... and they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth\nTo each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the uh yesterday and the abominable\nBelow snowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life\nAnd uh you know that thing is like reading or an encyclopedia on the creature a\nAnd yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything\nTo the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about big foot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax all of the uh uh a durable ridges on the footprints taken everything's a hoax to them so\nYou know we have to just keep doing what we do a in spite of ... with the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coast you know uh uh\nWe all tune in because we're hearing things that we can get you know the locations nobody's talking about what you're talking about\nYou and photos in big encounters where's the giant\nWell I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one day they'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... we're working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them uh to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that\nAnd then the second day uh the focus was on that of ah getting attention being have so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words held than SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making smoking for years using a green a green vows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nAre now during the day they had climbed up the side\nOf the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area right night for the hike\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision or by knock you lose your own monarch yellow\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one of the kid says hey what's sad and they noticed in the distance a light moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started ... daughter around in a crazy fish and which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAs they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around in the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they've been trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it\nFinally they got to a place where they believed there were a buck Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on it they can see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but it was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the it was that bright\nYeah I mean it's it it it's a glowing or above light ... around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a number picture this George a two inch wide let's just say ... a two foot wide beach ball he described a globe ... coming out of the size of this thing as being like when you blow bubbles through want as a child okay\nSo this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground\nAnd what blew the mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in this secondary glob coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but they were certain to what they were looking at\nAt some point the glob separates from the orb and now you have like this power of blue and white like with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately\nIt was then that they said\nThe bluish white light that was surrounding the big foot starts to dissipate\nWhere now the creature was left standing in the light of the circular all up and then they said it started to move at that point they got out of dodge\nWritten on the trail blame oh yeah I Can't blame the broke camp\nAnd while they were breaking down the tenth and everything just to get out of the place looking up on the mountain they saw that the war which they had originally seen was back to ... around in the woods\nOr which got their attention initially and what had happened to this big what they had no idea and nor did they get through you know go shake hands with it so it's very very bizarre and yet you're talking you know\nThis week in Nineteen fifty seven the Soviet Union and ... the space age with its

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstorm\nAnd that inspired a movie called the day after tomorrow and when I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what these protections\nCould very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie\nWell as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming and the Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve is Yellowstone and that for Kaine although I understand there's a big went under there you have\nTo call during the day after\nTomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nAh which which carries a millions of square miles of water of the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and the sinks into it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic the Indian in the Pacific\nThe the theory basically was that are warming would cause a\nCause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us into the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists now realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream\nMuslim slowing down and really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAll eggs and they'll make you\nStill don't think whoa okay go ahead you're on\nA Monday morning who ah who quiet down I just want to stay you we're we're\nTalking about landfills when I when I was\nLiving in Oregon okay\nAnd I used to drive past the wind will that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat and it was up by plenty more boy blue flame\nYou know they were were burning off\nThe methane gas while we're asking now why don't you put a generator on that\nAnd we'll do ... you know electricity\nNow come back and they said no no no it's going to cost too much you can have anything out now that can't be the only land they all in the United states we know that and they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why haven't there been anything done about that\nWell I think there are recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nOr but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi George and thank you for having Steve von Loor bumped into spoken to him several times I heard him on many shows\nAnd he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy a there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think\nWe should warn are good friends she not to make the same mistake that these are climate change hopes are are are using a bag lady I Believe you said\nA one point three billion people on this planet live on two dollars a day is that correct\nYeah I think it's about it's I think it's actually about two billion dollars I'm Sorry two billion Peebles it's quite a few of those are those are the United nations numbers I mean I haven't gone out and counted them\nOkay well I was using the one point three billion a papal so two dollars a day comes to point six billion dollars a day\nOr we would have just been nine hundred and forty nine billion dollars a year just to double their two dollars a day just four dollars a day and I'm going to come to the point that people like frosty will reject may end or a ... a\nA young child than a\nHere's the point is you've already said they weren't willing to do a hundred billion they're certainly not going to be willing to do nine hundred and forty nine billion right and and so\nSo what's frosty has told us is this is just sat in thinking that we can see your ah that by doubling people's daily\nA dollar allowance or would somehow going to a massively improved airlines they're doing All right with out as his boss she will rich a lot of them are\nAre
