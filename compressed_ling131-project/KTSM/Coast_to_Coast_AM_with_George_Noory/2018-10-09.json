artificial intelligence Byron Reese with us his book the fourth age if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was what we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain as a machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you\nAnd then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye view of a hundred than two hundred and two thousand than two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nThat that may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very little suggest the machine would do that now through through accidents are absolutely you\nKnow you had a you had a rocket blow up because the single one was a transposed with a ... an obese transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you\nKnow if you had a um you could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air air airplane for people\nI think you've got the co pilot right there you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it a quote has a heart attack look that\nYeah that may that may propagate through our systems maybe much ... much more brittle much one that they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the growth in the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man named McCarthy McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that very interesting reason which was\nNewt and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and they hope to find out what the intelligence we didn't\nThat being said people got excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody\nNeither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up to space up to space it's delivering the goods it can if if you have a business that can make probably any department in your business ten ten percent cost ten percent better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things he couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have the technology that we know how to do some really cool things if there were no more advances and I\nAh we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more dense is uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a series of artificial intelligence soldiers by the millions sending them into warfare in battle\nA it's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is a kind of artificial intelligence if it were a program that is if something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um it was a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing a the peaks or carrying a gun mhm\nAnd then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also sniffer gunpowder and you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to\nUm if you could have ... to to an artificial intelligence that fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we are going to make a ton of his killing systems IT\nIt's disingenuous the debaters I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know let the other guys all habit but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Koreans came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun that\nI'm sure people that have just automatically and it's required by law to say you know a leave of orange shoot\n'em and it requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally a ... they only because people were close to a show or it could easily be turned off so even if you will make decisions require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think that we're going to build a weapon systems it's\nGood to have it\nWell for for three reasons you could argue that\nThe the better the more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will you said in larger soldiers ... uh what in in whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they won't they won't work to be effective and probably cost effective will enable unfortunately lower the political cost going to war which is there's no not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapon systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know which reporters will cost\nA than perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you

who deliver the mail to our houses\nYou know I I I have a feeling that any job at a machine can do we really want machines to do it\nBecause it's the machine can do a job to make it you're going to do that job there's a word for that that's called the humanizing mhm 'cause if if you're just use the person for stand in or machine\nThat you're saying nothing about you that makes us human are we interested in the machine that there'll be a good\nUh is delivering the mail a or building packages something like\nI could imagine a machine that did it I could imagine a machine washing windows I can imagine machine that automatically most my yard and so I think by definition we kind of want to get machines to do those things\nThat I Know that if you took us to talk to these technologies this country for two hundred and fifty years as ... as hot unemployment between five and ten percent all the time except the depression which wasn't caused by technology\nFive to ten percent but but I think the half life of a job is fifty years I think every fifty years half of the jobs vanish and so you have to say how have we had full employment\nNew technology ... years\nRight and we had rising wages and because so why are we able to do it it's we're able to do it because a new piece of technology comes out and everybody sees it and says I'm going to use this to increase my own productivity so whatever\nIf if you can self driving cars you're going to have people who offered to ride around in the car and give you a tour of their city\nIf you are I mean like it's\nHard it's hard to necessarily for us to see all the things that are going to happen anymore than if you went back twenty five years and said to somebody hey in the future\nYou know there's gonna be this Web thing ... billion people are going to use it what do you think there's going to do the jobs you could've seen all the jobs that were gonna vanish she would say well that's going to be hard on the travel agents and the stockbrokers on the yellow pages of newspapers [noise]\nUm but you wouldn't have seen any of the things that got created you wouldn't have seen ... you when you see at sea air B. and B. Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's\nCreated and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't\nI don't think a robot can do\nA what a way to do you know they ... you you still a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming do you have a special order and you want you want to send your flew back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots that can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult\nYeah so well\nThe correct correct but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now heads down and and I think for for decades to come\nUm people aren't gonna you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it\nTells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm\nNot\nLike you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it I ... let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain because there's just so stinking so many neurons but people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm\nGot three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just take a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we we are so\nSpectacularly amazing uh beings that that to duplicate what we do with the machine is you\nKnow ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do and and\nWe've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented the nation state and that's why five dollars and years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge ... America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and sheen and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I don't I Can't predict what that's gonna what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or\nYou're ... you're right that is already Fishell intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and said that was a bad thing do we\nKnow not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah

having me on the show interesting topic I I just wanted to ask your guest there um if you think that the way technologies progress thing that we may get to that and your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings 'cause\nWorking alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you don't Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up to ... just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can grow your own food make your own clothes you can work Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ...

home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine\nA fix my road probably couldn't\nMachine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or would we wanted to\nAnd so I think machines will be doing almost anything that you can imagine\nA machine doing that doesn't require unique human

done that since landmines we drop ... dumb bombs or I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines that they kill\n'em so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe've always done that we build machines that\nWe push a button and we don't know who's going to die\nOr the debate that is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more advanced systems that operate completely economists leave that you can just release in an area and it will go and decided that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but bar but I agree with you\nBefore the age Martin robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Myron\nWherever find books are sold I think is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit by Ron ... dot com and there'll be a lot of links\nTo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's going to jump\nTo their e simple things one uh\nIndividual worldwide average income\nPer capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ Seventeen fifty nothing happened a lot if you look studying Seventeen fifty shot up like a rocket um\nWhy because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of wealth created\nOr eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical

already Throws Away in a food to feed all the hungry people\nNominal no of course you know that the world's strains to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we do so

isn't that the craziest title who called their book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers say about the fact that I mean here you are you were a corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ghost photographer\n[noise] get out and it's it's it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is you know rooted and data and and I'm and I'm now ... you know within the organization thing you know very direct honest kind of person that when I started telling these stories\nAnd they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like way you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd when you went [laughter]\nAnd you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people and have kind of gone with me on the journey and I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent and you know they they just\nThey can't make their way over right are nine that's right\nUm but I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they can interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise] and I realized you know during this time that I was kinda thinking about you know\nPut it writing it all down like oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like a crazy which is one reason I Would actually wanted to write the book was so\nYou know people could feel liberated to tell they talk about their experiences as so many people what Adam and I also wanted him to yeah I wanted to write it so people will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know in their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into this and like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who has gone through the same thing they open up\nMy gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd you mind if I roll through to a couple of staff for them\nBecause I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes photography a little bit about medium shift just you know some of those things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and go\nSo we're almost majority attorneys were barely a minority\nAnd that's grown up\nAnd and you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nCould be worse if the person\nI I Would think so and the second is that um I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds someone in North America is Googling the word ghost\nNot all sing yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose whose listening um but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I had a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nHas nothing to hide and have nothing to hide\n... journey started for you because personal situation\nYes she did did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey Adderall transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I lost my mother to all timers a and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone um and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd opened a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world\nHolder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand\nBut aggressive if\nYou have been doing sham me these what kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found I used\nIn what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was an iPhone I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sampson camera on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that worms you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know\nWhen this was going on for the entire jury looks looks good into your mother's situation and the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you started investigating these strange thing yeah\nI um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas through this and you know how how make me understand that I was an absolutely crazy and then I wasn't running up and down the streets the Sherman Oaks screaming you know hide your kids had your wife we got ghost in the neighborhood\nAnd um so ... so I had some guides\nI ... you know that that we're helping me understand it and an album investigated and um I I started you\nKnow after I saw the first coast in a photograph I um you\nKnow I kind of panic was intrigued because I I got to be honest with you George I was a little bit of a skeptic before a skeptic as then it's not true\nSkeptic that you want to know\nRight right I it it was in a this can't possibly be true kind of person but\nYou know I was like really really take pictures of goes\nUm so I you know I I read a lot I investigated I talked I I I mean I I think I did what any but he would do is just trying to understand what was happening and you know I I think\nLooking at the underlying aspect of it is I I I think when people are in grief and people are experiencing grief I'm wearing chaos and when you're in chaos\nUm you're able to open up and shed would ever rigidity or get over yourself or get over it whatever skepticism you may have and and I think you fall into things like this\nI'm with a lot of ease because you're looking\nYou're looking for something right you become a seeker and I think for me I became so incredibly interested in it\nAnd I would spend hours taking pictures and I would spend hours um you know putting them through a

Adam and Eve away from God today\nYou get them scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit spirit goes off and parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the actual planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think that's a little space before it lands properly and you are a line\nOn is when this can happen again is just a theory\nThat's pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have had a bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark does it need more dark dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight so I think it's you know people are are these bright lights and I think that this entity\nKind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm a of what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because\nOf that is probably the most profound event that has

name as wrong as I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my ex step dad who was not very nice and I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him I don't think it was my accept that but I think it was the ... man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people there to say um but I think that you know\nIf anybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're gonna find that thing that triggers you right there and find that deep dark thing they're going to find who is the antagonism this person's life and mine is my accept that\nAnd and he brought that up and Alex didn't didn't even know about my accepted didn't even know his name\n\nWhen all this was happening [laughter] we went weird yeah I mean\nAre you

Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter and delivered food to you you get a tip that I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't\nI don't think a robot can do a what a way to do you know they ... you you still\nA drink you know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming that you have a special order you want you want to send your flew back there was something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's funny we we\nWe have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do and then we have this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled\nWe don't have robots that can they can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well the correct\nCorrect but it's proved very difficult like right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long\nSo right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come um people aren't going to you're not going to make machines and had the same range of movement generally going to have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your wall out\nTo run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number I'm happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kind of wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say a real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines are which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does and then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause it's just so stinking so many neurons but people who spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm\nGot three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to model that in the computer just make a worm that lives in a computer with a brain of three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible so there are so many we're we're so spectacularly\nAmazing uh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\n[noise] so you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages we already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we were able to do\nAnd and we've used it to overcome scarcity because for law human history there's just never been enough of the good stuff never enough food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed for victory of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know man of was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the man it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and not actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor\nAnd the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity and then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented the nation state and that's why five thousand years ago you can kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge\nSome ... ... ... so America and just go all over the world and so I Do think\nThat um that\nArtificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in the machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we are the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter huh I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called them robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can I'm coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast or you're\n... you're right that dog official intelligent you it is to be\nFrightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing did we\nNo not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers a sibling bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it to Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce
