the two were similar to packages sent to other high profile Democrats including former president Brock Obama and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nExactly right we've got a conspiracy then at that point whether or not it is a\nYou know a a a something that is coordinated or something that is organic but I can tell you this I Want to get to the bottom I Want to hear what the authorities have to say about this\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing this to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know where everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment so that somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroked\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can ... ideas vigorously break these ideas and\nThen you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents and leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever whoever it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting me\nThe states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that would get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wakeup call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican as your enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy\nWe're all on the same team and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability and is we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd build on and the individual or the group that some of these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer you cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keeps keeps their mouth shut\nI think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nThat our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals and institutions in in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWeather or somebody on the left or somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again 'cause I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag\nIt'd be somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut out way let the intelligence officials do their jobs then wants their job is completed and they've determined who've done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one\nCountry we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and they flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in\nFront of they sure did in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue and less stop this rhetoric\nThat drives us apart and and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the

today um I Would I Would estimate that the probability of this thing track down to either the perpetrator or perpetrators of a very short period of time as being very very high\nUm for purely technical reasons I mean these are all unexploded devices\nThat means all kind of trace evidence is available from them and they're all they've all gone are all going to the FBI the U.S at some of them were sent through the regular mail for us here\nAnd then I just wanted to know if they're from one city one location or a number of different cities\nThey probably have that all figured out already the entire us if network is highly computerized they have photos of the packages as they cross through the ...\nThey got pictures of the person if he delivered it to the post office have or is it\nThe post offices ... I mean this is the kind of thing where where if you wanted to have the best possible evidence it's almost as if someone wants to be caught so I I think probably within a day or two days or certainly in a short period of time we're going to find out who is behind this and then some of these questions are are going to start to be possible\nAnd she'll say that again about a minute left the optics story really like\nI I mean this is mostly a a you know it kind of future kind of issue with it more it it's more involving a inter ISP communications rather than individual I think the question it

and we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody\nWho might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter in Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little slipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big bear\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo I stand telling me telling me what's going on in the field of view ... these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\n[noise] well I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've\nCome to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right when Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or are they going to be sending a signal the latest word\nAgainst it looks like there was about one point six climates per star ... the star and our galaxy the Milky Way has ... billion star at all so that\nMeans one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the place and you know and that changes our picture we used to think oh we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course I'm not the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know getting here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a virus comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we're ... we're fusion for example or you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop mushroom part of the world was created and four thousand B. C.\nThat's right and who am I\nBeing around and you know well he was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little a little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere on migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying but the mirror throws a climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy\nGuy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's you're standing you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide yet\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that well we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that\nThere's only a few thousand flights you know if there are life out there and we see it\n... you know they would make contact and land on the White House lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we that makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr were still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so most of us have learned that if it's a more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd much shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of ... and the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number oh oh no\nNo\nAnd so we and you can tell from another thing ah the military budget on a point of about a trillion dollars this year uh so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that at all these\nGoodies of our um their work uh we take the leaving because we're stocking up on and on ways to kill a number of people and it seems I I don't\nBut I'm saying that's human nature but it appears to be close to what it is I'm not going to try to explain why or how what are we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've gone through the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... the nearest person and all almost kind of stuff in\nThe universe crowded [laughter] you know it takes a while to get here and there you don't get on your bicycle and go to the next door [laughter]\nSimon's first album to do so emancipated from Simon and Garfunkel fans finally stopped shouting where's the party at his shows\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy six Chicago started a two week running number one on the U.S singles chart which if you leave me now it was the group's Eighteenth top forty hitter but its first number one it went on to win the Grammy Award for best pop vocal performance this\nWeek in Nineteen eighty seven Michael Jackson started a two week run it number one on the U.S singles chart with bad\nThe music video for bad directed by Martin Scorsese and co starring one of the first appearance as of yet undiscovered Wesley Snipes was released later in Nineteen eighty seven\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three time magazine put any better on the cover with the headlines all the rage book veteran Kurt Cobain refused to speak with the magazine for the story but they rented anyway and then they tend to explain why young people are listening to such an angry music and this week in two thousand\nThree in the middle of their first world tour and flush with fame from their debut album Evan essence founder Ben Moody abruptly quit the band\n\nThere's or look back at\nTime for you or a T.

that bar there was never six people in there\nThat's strange I'm trying to remember bill a there was John Kennedy and Jackie in the back seat there was a secret service agent in the driver's seat and then other in the past and there was another in the past it was only four I remember right well\nNo I I remember governor calmly and his wife\nIn that car as well because I was like governor calmly with hit off with one of those sports well\nNo you're right the governor ... was in front of him because he ... he had one of the ...\nThe magic bullet\nBut where was a world was his wife\nTo laugh so Conley with the front of Kennedy and his wife was to his\n... but the the car was a front seat back seat right or was there a third seat their third narrow\nStreet there and I can't remember if the if the seat was um [noise] with Connelly and his wife\nOr you want you know ... ... ... you don't read the con Connelly if\nI remember the artistic sketches of the shooting were they track the bullet Connelly was sitting in front of the president\nSo he got he bought but what I don't know is whether he was in a bench before him how that seating arrangement was I I I think he was sitting in a bench in front of the president or the way I liked the front seat I think he was in the front\nAnd so the so governor calmly and his wife or in front of President Kennedy and his wife\nSo there were three people in the front seat\nNo they weren't another so it it would have been another seating there and then they\nDrive early or any other Secret Service agent was on the passenger side so you would have had six people\nAnd that would have been six that strange rocks and the Thomas looking at it and what do you need to look to can you turn Tom spike up for just one second Denny to put your

third row either belt thanks stop okay\nYeah that's amazing and and again I'm that's why I always thought that it was just Secret Service agents in the front seat and then a second row with Governor currently and his wife and his wife was to his law president\nJackie were in the back and Jackie was to his left\nThat's true and I mean I definitely do the secret service agent was on the front dry bean because everybody accused him of I'm turning around shooting the president uh yeah and I don't believe that happened\nBut I you know again I think about this study that as well because William Cooper is on was saying that I write you know I thought about it I thought okay well the driver would have had Ruben left handed if that's the case and also [noise]\nHe's driving so that means they'd

Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers you're right that's got to be you have you read Karen\nI have been doing great George how 'bout you I'm great together we just didn't act like\nColor everything sure enough for people who need to know who you are Karen ... is the ... board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say yeah we\nWe divorced tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of\nThe talking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things ... board\nMarlon I'm more moral mark ... believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind let's say it that way she's very kind\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves Luigi board folks as you know I'm opposed to it on and want to use it but Karen feels very secure with it I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge it has to do with the use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also ... lot of people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about and how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of fears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for the place of love\nFor the place of light from the place of wanting to explore to discover than the whole the whole atmosphere around this tool changes\nSome people believe that the ... opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and introduced to come through what's your thoughts on that\nSure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and so I've been won't believe and that they're earning power that they're just the pond to their world\nAnd what my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength within and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts incarnate when you come from a place of that\nKind of be on that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating communing with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have ... there's no hidden spirits in view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of\nIts within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in these rails\n[noise] have you ever had a bad ... no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing at me once and the war and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were crossing the\nBorder but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse it's the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did with say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board\nOn our dog had going\nGood and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of\nMy own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything is negative and I'm fearful of everything\nThat's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment within me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving in the plant ya urine is it the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving well let me answer that from\nA few different directions one as many people believe is eating motor effect which really basically means your mind as controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles through the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thought about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nThat's Beijing worked with an inch absolutely\nAmazing and I will say this uh the group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to before I talked about um before on your show than work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself\nI prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning the frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages to slow the plan to move and for that for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls at the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your weed you board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you though cure and to put somebody down if they don't like to read you board that I appreciate it\nWell I I you know that that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness and this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness ocean I'm not\nFor that I'm for having a discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions this tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use a tool that's kind of floor or a different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there\nIs a great diversity of a amongst us\nWe believe it doesn't work some of some of the leaves it works because of eating motor and a few of us might believe it works because we're actually connected with an energy outside of herself\nBut we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so we're we're a group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nHaunted the board start and and how how long ago\nWell there's there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando has term do we just ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um he turns it we just fish is because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece\nThat is not true there's a different detonation tool that started back then\nThe first board that we have a we have an understanding that because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board it's Eighteen eighty six known as the which board now we know this board existed and was made by a company called the ws read toy company\nAnd George the cool thing about this is it's really

who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little slipping in the Detroit News that he was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicists expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time\nSo I took my tape recorder out I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis he was the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some live events with me I think I'm going to be with you an alien fest the end of January up near the big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field have you followed these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened as we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right\nWhen Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal\nWell the latest word against it looks like there was about one point six climates per star\n... ... per star and our galaxy the Milky Way has about a hundred billion\nStar at all so that means is one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few solution to the ... around and we're at the top of the heap well\nRoll over the place and that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long and leave plenty of room in other words\nFor others and we come to realize that you know gotten here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a primary comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that uh you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and can't be much crepes and back and forth now we're ... we're fusion for example ... you can get\n... hours we also realize that the country a sixteen fifty I guess a bishop mushroom part of the world was created and four thousand B. C. that's right can't be too late beings around you know well he was off a little bit four billion be\nJust a little a little uh our ...\nNatural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things the ultimate you know hurtful thing [noise]\nUm we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and there should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throwing some climate that they put in incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth\nAnd you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand the you were one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story\nNationwide yet but in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's Italy and visitors and as a matter of hungry for expanded the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on the wall we think there's one point search planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably come in here uh I I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand pilots you know if\nThere are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact and by the White House\nLawn and all kinds of crazy so now I think it's more like realizing that at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we but makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nOr or still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us have learned that if it's more complex place than we thought it was and we have to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of land and the stars and things like that and uh hey\nWe're not number oh oh no no and so\nWhat we and you can tell from another thing the military budget on apply to about a trillion dollars this year or so we haven't changed much have\nWe know that it'll have people don't get\nThe goodies of are on their work we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill other people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature but it appears to be close to what it is I'm not going to try to explain why or how much we know enough to say that a\nIs an awful lot of energy available to them in the universe and you know I've gone to the sequence of I Know huh how long does it take to get some place how ... the nearest person on almost kind of stuff in\nWhere like neither paralyzed that are in power I stand up and protect that we live\nDid say for like ...
