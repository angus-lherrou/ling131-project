[noise]\n\n\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis ... talking with Ben Radford then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that time Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that that ... that he had found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you that actually\nI was just such an offensive like the first of all the you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids\nAt all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if it makes me I Want to offer but\nI wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know there's always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to the emergency rooms where they really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen and now I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X ray of the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually finding anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy\nIf you have any any doubt throw it out you don't yeah I don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make it just toss it the way I just the whole thing is just silly\nNow my dad would go through it\nAnd say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so then you can see all the stuff that he wanted\nTo point where the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are coming for soles of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted houses come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nAnd then it came over with the with the first and second wave of the of the ah the immigrants to the United states\n... and in fact you we mentioned little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... and so that for for so certainly for for for many years um of course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask\nSo your people were having to be creative you know boy the horror\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nUh the first um the in the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years\nI'm uh they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and your plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you started getting adults who were you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the ...\nYeah and of course as soon\nAs you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right you know and they're all you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know ... that's fun I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade caution that really creative and not just you know do something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so\nHow do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to do that how do you see the future\nOf Halloween how do you see it\nIn about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well I Know a good question you know I think that um you know\n... mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the mixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations it changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known that might I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think is really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean you're okay for eighty year old kid like to dress up and so there is something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty you're fifty years or who knows maybe two hundred years from now will be a sort of you know virtual a go if you know where you've\nGot like holy crap [laughter] oh you got that yeah that was the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to ask them about their seat panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is will is to wean tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or get signed up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\nAnd now I look back at this week in history\nThis week in Eighteen sixty three expressing gratitude for a pivotal union army victory at Gettysburg President Abraham Lincoln announces that the nation will celebrate in official Thanksgiving holiday ... member twenty six Eighteen sixty three the speech declared that the fourth Tuesday of every November\nThere after would be considered an official US holiday of Thanksgiving\nThis weekend Nineteen fifty seven the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age with its launch a button they cut the world's first artificial satellite spacecraft\nTo his name's Nick after the Russian word for satellite the U.S government military and scientific community were caught off guard by the Soviet technological achievements and they're United efforts to catch up with the Soviets heralded the beginning of the space race\nThis week in Nineteen sixty five ... six arrived\nThe Kennedy international airport in New York City the first visit\nBy renting post to the United states during his packed one day American visit limited entirely to New York city police Paul visited St Patrick's cathedral met with President Lyndon Johnson at the Waldorf Astoria hotel address the general assembly of the United nations attended a public math at Yankee Stadium and then flew back to Rome from Kennedy Airport\nAnd this week in two thousand three actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is elected\nGovernor of California despite his inexperience Schwarzenegger came out on top and the eleven we campaign to replace Gray Davis due earlier had become the first United States governor to be recalled by the people since Nineteen Twenty one stores and there was one of a hundred and thirty five candidates on the ballot which included career politicians other actors\nAnd one adult film star that's your look back at this week in history when you\nWant her beautiful country we have\nAs we work to come together let's remember something we all believe in\nThe form of insulin brimming UNICEF knows that invest in your job and these are huge that's one Ninety cents of every dollar us ...

Willis here on coast to coast am our gas tonight on Willis wean is Benjamin Radford we've been talking about the origins of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented ... we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all love\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the\nOf saline theme of ghost tiny so Ben I'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness and say panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little thing for I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted houses you know reach out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever and it's the only thing that some of that but\nBut you know that's for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean as I mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause a candidate because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they ... if if he drinks are when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the idea what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before um before you know the the the Christian concept of of of\nA scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's but there's tradition of course I mean you look at accidents twenty two Eighteen\nYou know ... not suffer which to live um and so there's a there's a strong tradition in in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that that's one of the more uh obviously comes up\nEvery every year so it coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart of St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it weren't you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nSo concerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know do you want and corals or whatever\nI I I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you find this don't use it and so you know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that's where the concern came from and so it was ... that a kid the dresses up as a witch or goal\nWill become interested in witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\nParents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party they have a harvest party so they they they they they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is not always as the harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something ... anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was it was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in like I said again you know black lights in the\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest advance like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen it came to ... just the way it was right down the marathon\nBar on either right away I Am doing those\nHuge freeze those have you ever had um frozen\n... they were great oh I'm sure you're just taking you back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grand that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written or something yeah\nAnd the ruler on the back\nOh man I I mean anything Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way Yeah Yup yup\nNever on all the producers were were watching that cell or hey you guys are going on there now are so well\nKnowing all

will is wean is\nWhat's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he\nAlso is an investigator mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nSo that's that means that they can be recorded um on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used to detect ghost for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we were well we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field is actors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science or in goes hunting and that is one thing that frustrates me because I think\nThose are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see a good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool ... why what what is it\nWell you know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's that's a million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hundreds and believers are across the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their\nResidual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there's something that's going on and\nIt was some murder murder tragedy that was recorded in stone and tree the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit that that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions\nProblematic for goes research right because goes can't be both inner dimensional spirits\nAnd you know an emotional recording into a tree or house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena that has such a widely disparate range of explanations that's a problem so I\nI don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that that my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we were we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nFor windows for Willis we thank\nYou for hitting these information you had in fact that I Know you have a

K. and what was interesting in the research it turns out that the archeologists also found a red the skull caps are they in like a head dress\nWith holes and fries and an leather straps to all the mumble they believe that these early people or shame on them they practice the ship and I practice\nUh now I'm not saying that is the reason we have the stories of the flexed and well we'll put it is interesting that when you sort of cast your mind to was the transformation into other animals and other based as they started combing through\n... from the Israeli people I mean I think we have to consider these things as I say I don't particularly think that as a person running round in court off times how the moon but I'm One hundred percent believe that the people who've come forward and told me the stories of ...\nA telling the truth I mean if you like a refuge was built county in the ... century I took place called spiritual Kona inflicts than\nIt was built by a king all this can be research listeners you know it's not just things that poll is made up a and the king was ...\nHe ... he gave a night the job of building the refuge and the night it's a fabulous name was called ace home so he built his refuge to protect Trump travelers from an infestation of Savage base\nThat's the ...\nYeah it's fabulous some spots where the name spittle hospital comes from\nSo it was was built to that's why they call it spits O'Connor or at least they be devoured I I was lucky enough to contact the people in our own\nWhat what is now the ... in ... after they've been stopped face to being a refugee hundreds of years ago because they wasn't nine fifty seven ... this refuge was built so we're going back a long way obviously not far back as the early settlers of stock or\nA bill to prevent it but it was due to protect travelers from an infestation of Savage beast\nLeast they be devoured it said no I've looked at that dates and the ... some of the days that I'm ...\nAnd that's what it says I'm the documentation on the line that you'll find that he says this we we must also not forget ... you know during this time we will divide wolves prevalent\nThe u._k. and fast so you know ... we're not necessarily to an entirely talking about too well we'll just these stories that are quite incredible because when you look at the line and you and you're going to the research you discovered the flakes than\nWas once called ... which is interesting and I am now ... old ... on old maps those areas afflicts than depicted as well fund\nAnd just a few ... as soon as somebody changed the name\n... to to make it like like maybe the seems safer or something or they didn't want people to think of the old miss maybe or you know why would someone changed the name I mean that sounds like ooh there's a reason why it was a name that\nYeah well there's a reason and we'd go connotations to the wolf for you know in any case it is true with proper research this that that can be sort of ... to ... ... if anyone else wanted to look into it sure\nYou know there's a there's a small village just a few miles away called home to ... and if you break down the name ... and then go back in history and look we'll do some sort of research and\nHousing hound non they it is they used to be called farms that of the hound mom was all these\nSorts of incredible\nConnections to the wolf until the dog there was a an hour that stood on some old maps called bomb dog house we realized once again that this does not throw as into the realms of the ... when when I started collecting these stories when I went and spoke to first time witnesses\nAre going back to the Nineteen forties I mean one of these guys are still\nIt's still alive and well can I think we were pushed probably just jump into this and stop telling some of the stories of\nLab to Italy I'm listening to ya I'm enjoying myself\nLoose wean I'm In the dark delight you're yeah man I'm listening to these nice little stories getting me into the Louis we know now I think in a way I'm I'm very interested in hearing about where will not only do I want to hear about the end\nBut let me know if you think any of this do with what we also call Don man\nThis is a good point so before we start about yeah I I think that they probably is connected to what you called dark matter which ... which I Would say is a relatively new to ... well well well is it interesting to ... we always have the ridicule ...

I mean it's an interesting story\nHe said it was with his friends said need noted for the past week or two weeks that something was ripping the prey out to be snazzy what my roommates net to catch the rubbish and the has and the other game small game\nAnd his words with ice is proper sort of ... born and bred and these were pretty ragged him out to ... as\nHe said but we couldn't sort of what he was he said we just couldn't understand what was doing it you know still a bit of snow on the ground you could see such a rose or they ... as you look over towards the ... the the open fields and he's on the edge of folks ... with us it's friend who was doing the poaching\nIn the daytime than the lodge hedge homes and things about he said he probably eight to ten foot tall and he well he sort of turn round to speak to his friend and talk this thing and he's peripheral vision and then looked and saw it\nLeft over the head ... he said that he thought he was a U hauls he meant halls so hate older bless each other for a while you'll also first so I couldn't believe what I was looking out so what we're saying is that this thing was as big as a small town in order you you know your own house\nHe said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge and just let him that he said wait expects a horse to lend to move forward because the the momentum this thing just landed and stuff like a magnet\nSudden something not to be nice to look at that\nHe said was the most peculiar thing he'd ever seen he said he led them before you run away he said he was on all fours\nAnd he said if it's still do consider being over seven Fulton looked like a body builder he said you know he said he was a tiny waist and the main like a lion in the face of a of a boom\nAnd ... and he said he ... he was almost sort of Britain's gulag you know like a box that dog all the stuff that you both terriers\nAnd that what he ... he says well it's an I went to the edge off to them to try and get sentenced Dave it's just to protect myself he says although there's nothing we could have done if this thing I decided they were going to come across to us they said the speed it covered crossing the field and into the world\nOr what quite incredible um you know that's four miles from the coast all the sightings are quite close to the coast county\nAnd if you if you go further down the coast was whole or in the papers probably two years ago there was the piece the bombs to drain the fates\nIn the u._k. because quite often and this was supposed to be aware of it was going to train them into the sea six miles from where I'm not no [noise] so we'd go this way type creature recorded moving along the coast and they could go for the coast you\nFolklore don't let you owe legends of talks with glowing red I guess that ... the ravens got what they too hot food\nAnd you know he started to come down living down in time I think that's grains of truth in the story so that was the right thing in the Nineteen seventies and the lifting all his life\nAnd he's never seen it since he's never seen it before but never seen it after that which is quite incredible if this thing I Believe his story about this thing was to that you would think it'd be more evidence so why are we only seeing smoke glimpses of it\nHe was in a mate yeah and that's what you're saying that they pop in and they pop out along the way kind of like\nWhen I talk to people before uh we had um\nA friend of mine Laurie Williams she's a remote viewer in I Would have heard target big flood and as she targeted she had mentioned how they they are actually didn't know what it was you know she is looking at this esoteric target that I gave her and she's talking about how they had these portals\nAnd they would end time warps and and they would just go through one time warp and then another and you just see them when they pop into that particular one you know in ... where where human would see I'm\nI'm I find I find it also interesting ah when you were saying that Ari asked is there the world's oldest the operational radar base is right there and all this area where all this crazy stuff happens and I think I remember seeing a sure thing\nThat might be my phone about a coup so people just it's it's cutting in and out\nSo well is showing no actually it's all now I'm a I'm Sorry about it with Joe meant to hang up and you got me back\nYou know well well you're flying right now for sure and will do that if the break for sure but yeah but I can hear you but again I think it I think it's very strange it is operational radar base the oldest one is in the midst of all of these happenings that you're talking about\nThat's correct Tony ... and ... jumping to them and why the mutilation taking place rate up which was eleven miles from Stockton lies and that one's close that one closed\nAbout Seventy two sixty eight but he was still operational ... feel for them to to and from the edge you know the idea that remain\nOkay now he's gone [laughter] so it will definitely contacting back on one of his other phone said he has there isn't that crazy brand new song a brand new batteries and it goes out um ...\nStrange isn't it when we talk about some of these things that I don't know I don't know you'll always on the story [laughter]\nWillis lean continues here on coast to coast am I'm tiny Willis and

we were jumping into the store is now trying to give listeners a breakdown of why the why the area special and how the stories of come through and\nA little bit of history about the area and everything's quite close to the coast as well Tony you know in most instances but only like four miles away from the coast to the point\nAnd these and the this coastline around ... to ... to the un speech and the rugged cliffs with\nAbsolute must have network of sea caves some of them have never been never beat entered I mean if if we romance with the notion that this was a real living flesh and blood creature breathing than\nBreathing and surviving then I suppose it could function in in these areas\nSimply because of our in our ... anybody who did a bit of research would find the ... and there's more ships being wrecked out to say than anywhere else in the u._k. you can't get close to these cliffs\nA you know I'm not saying that that's where these things in happy valley is just an angle to look up\nVotes I'm staying it quite close to ... and ... twelve miles away there's a huge area of would love to know if you're in North your trickled ... Dale [noise]\nAnd we can sort of accurately they to the summer of two thousand and six and three young men or mountain bikes sets of setting the trailers and doing what a well all you guys are ... women and girls as well we're doing a good such a ride around this woodland pots\nAnd this one may fall into the big ... ... ... is nevertheless an interesting story or late evening still light on the ... the ... about fall for high end result trees all around them as the recycling down these parts\nOf the ... mountain became aware and shouted tuition says can you see that they said about forty two away from them that on the staff and the Bracken moving that going down quite fast down these hills\nIs what they described as an upright gorilla now they described it says will cry because he didn't appear to be ruining\nAnd that they that black fur covered very big uh you know what I think we're talking like over eight feet tall\nA well like the ... before it's all in the city for for ... bucks at least\nUnless things they described it says like it was on a track\nYour ... you know they couldn't see legs and they said they were living up around how would they all they were familiar with most of the [noise]\nThe ... the foreigner and rocks and an ally of the ... there's no way that it wouldn't have been jumping over fall and branches and rocks for this thing ... was just smooth and gliding over the top of the Bracken as though it was just fix ... says when we were going as fast as we could\nCause it said that it frightened your says hell yeah they said we're ... which I decide\nTo because they were keeping pace with us and it was ... that was the strange thing as well ... well it didn't seem to have to look forward\nIt was look it was fixed on them so\nThey said eventually we got to the ... which fault talked to the left into the rights he said and we went right sort of choosing the path that will take them far away from this thing and they left it that's all the scene of\nYes these two friends if they wanted to talk about it I got the story of one of the guys they they still tobacco the story but they they didn't want to they didn't want to come forward\nOr with the amounts of detail that this this month so if they're given my book I think probably Coney we're looking more something big foot relate to that but once again there's a mystical element to it in the east\nNot running in the way the conventional way we would expect some things to ruin all moving should I say you know [noise]\nSo yeah you you know it's it's [noise]\nWe just got this bill for a little bit you know we we talk a little bit before we did this and that just to say Hi to each other and one of the things\nThat that is tough for both of us is there's no word that really work in our language for what this is it's so hard to describe the scene and are these events as well as the beans in the creatures themselves but you just can't put into words\nWhatever's going on there whatever it is it's beyond what we know and what we're supposed to know or see or what is supposed to be real and it's so hard to describe these things when you put together I mean yeah we want to focus on the where we'll split\nBut when you put all his together in the area that you are there are so many things that are going on\nIn his radius and again going back to the fact that these radar bases were there there was a picture that you had\nThat you sent me and I guess it's been one of your books that was a picture I'm a I guess there were some happening then that went on some sort of a dance and that were seen and then the next day or maybe within the same hours of it there's this like vehicle\nAnd it's got some sort of satellite dish on it\nAnd it's going up to this guy I mean after these events this new vehicles their\n... the county you're you're talking about something that we saw in on July the twenty fifth or twenty seven thing to just if we if we may just jump from the ... for a moment he's yeah sure\nThese vehicles I've got a phone call from a guy called David hind\nAh lives in the village of ... and he said Paul I think you really need to go and look at these vehicles out and I did just that I took a camera I got pictures of them and they were the drums and they had a huge green books from the back with a radar dish on the top [noise] um I'm trying to do this ... going to cause I'm realizing you might want\nMe to talk with the way we can take your time\nAnd ... and that was a huge trailer which we now know how to ... a a generator which would top to now the license plates with German\nA ... on the the units themselves was American\nThat in an area the little known this script village called them some of the pack John Blake Hounshell lane Blake how Blake can bring relief to them slumber to them in our genes black they say something Blake choice black how blackberry amount lane he's just so happened a few weeks before I\nGot photographs of a triangular impression the period in a ... crop that somebody told me about on black Halloween [noise]\nOn the twenty fifth of July when these vehicles will see and um they stayed weeks by the way they weren't just that on the twenty fifth of July the same night we got photographs of light so under the sea or I don't say they likely thought and the one we we have the images that you know because lots of people can say these things and complicates oh\nJust three points of light onto the scene daylight\nAnd washed up on the cliff talks I received a phone call from a guy who you know he's ...
