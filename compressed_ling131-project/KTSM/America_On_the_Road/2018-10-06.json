weekend you're on Google\nJust to go ahead and go with the term text adventure\nAnd this story caught my attention over a ... security crazy story that I have to tell you about how voice fishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this ... bags and a small\nPortland credit union last week he got a call himself from it from an eight hundred number that matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this must really be important I should answer\n[noise] so he was greeted by a female voice who explained that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in a hole in Ohio made to his debit ATM card [noise] she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nWe told the lady listen I'm going to replace him card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or those the only two states\nAnd it be and he said yeah I'm just going to California orange so not a problem any charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor she didn't said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect she said is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's may he said yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seemed ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card that I'm mailing out to you\nI can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have\nRight now and he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account there were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars [noise] there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there's a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account\nSo what this scammer head was every single thing about him except for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had been number she had everything in front of her\nBut she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhat would
