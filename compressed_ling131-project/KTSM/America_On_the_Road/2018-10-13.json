start creating a new post on Facebook you tap the menu at the top right used to like three D. photo that's going to bring you up to the photo folder on your phone you select the phone ringing postage you had a caption than you to share it out\nI Can't wait until we see all those three D. photos hacked on Facebook\nOur money to this moment to wait ten free things at every Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this and back to the phones we go with a let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nEntered him hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right yeah my question it's okay to fail all along reputation management mhm let's let's be like what would be the best oh yeah that I can find full small medical office\nAnd also what I was looking at it that was all or yellow software that you ... and then the field that search engine optimization ethical would all fall out\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem with them or if it's obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many\nGood reviews that go on line to help you out right with the bad reviews\nBalance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go on line at the post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so what am I here mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation\nType management farm okay [noise] is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because you are may be able to do it more effectively\nAnd do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this\nAll works okay because as it as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too is that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nBut and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical ... it's like ... grade the current okay all\nThey use excel okay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust dropped them up in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades as drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it and what I have\nHeard is that when you do this or that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status and that'll put you at the top and then we'll also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay\nUm there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up was a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nIs that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire a firm because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars will which you at the top of the Google Search
