you a my wife and I are building new\nRight in the kitchen part right now are trying to figure out some of them are saying it has a quick oh yeah the ... my wife is really interested I'm right now our kitchen ... it'd be a white catch and and she was a a print arm think uh-huh and then we're trying\nTo figure out what the best material is because I Know there's you know several out there but they're trying to figure out what you ask them what's going to be the most durable\nFrom Mm some questions so what are you looking at like a glazed porcelain and then a composite that type of thing\nUm yeah and she also looked up the cast iron where a horse and when the name on it now as well yeah well if you had a\nI don't I you know what I haven't really done a research is saying this as best I think one of the things I kinda like right now it's kind of the composites\nOnly I mean the cast iron I mean let's face it the cast aren't ... been around for a hundred years right\nI mean they're pretty drew role but you know if for whatever reason we drop a big old iron skillet they have a tendency to chip\nA composite it ... a composite I think is a little bit I'm less likely to be damaged but I haven't really dove into it to really compare the two have you looked at the composite jet or not\nI'm a little bit here and they are but I mean we just kinda started within the last\nDay out All right well those are the two main ones that I Know a ... in terms of their ability and that's the two I guess I Would investigate further I I don't\nThink you can go wrong with either but porcelain blazing dust chip I mean\nBut you and let me put that in context to soldiers granite [laughter] you know and then they can both be repaired but I I just kind of get\nSome uh folks that are selling both um you know get to a a Ferguson cut ... kitchen a bath show room and in give it to people that are ... both of them all the time to get their take on it and there may be something that I'm not even aware of ... to be honest with you to\nThose big farm sinks are beautiful and they they are trendy right now\nYeah yeah and they are already parades on it All right my friend daycare thanks Bye bye and if if you're listening and you have some take on a love to love to hear from you too so feel free to jump on board and mark welcome\nVery long time listener thank you\nI got a two problems here in the same area let me give me a little background first uh this is for a church sanctuary where we had a slam problem okay\nStarted where we had a pipe or should we had to replace the carpet will replace the carpet we found that the swam in one area had a reason not to to bite breaking\nUp but it was a different one inch between one trap and the other some other great system we're on the outside that seems to be working we did finish that July and it's a lab is lord by happy ...\nIt's changed in elevation the first\nOne I Want to know is what you're suggesting is on fixing that slab we're looking at two things one is to just grind it down so that you got to either so between the boom\nAnd the second is to kind of a a section out a Fifteen inch section is about a forty foot long area that we got this problem and cut that section out and in a slope down from one slap to the out of there so I ended up looking the same but they're two different methods\nIn terms of cost a big difference I guess between grinding and then I'm cutting the whole sleigh about reporting and sloping correct\nI haven't really priced him out yet I I I did get a\n... price one time on on the cutting them out I did not get a a one on now you\nWrite in your own them down how how sick is this lab lab is five inch five and so\nReally grinding a half inch shouldn't you know create any a issue with the uh\nUm integrity of this lab itself I'm you know I mean to fix it permanently I guess I'm kind of like the idea of grinding it out or not greening up and actually cutting it out and replace him put a little slow but\nIf we got a five in slab I think it's going to be a lot cheaper to grind it I'd probably focus on going that way\nOkay if you if you cut it out with your pin it with your pin\nYeah you have to you wouldn't have to add a construction joint oh\nI really look at time trying to grind it I really what I had a store one time it was all his lab and we had an area because they poured concrete when it was like Fifteen below zero and we tried the patch it first that didn't work\nAnd we try to ... parts of it they cut out and it was okay it kind of work but it was very expensive to do the whole thing and then we grain part of it and it did fine\nOkay we'll look at the grinding I I Would take a look at that and that in fact I probably am both bit out and take a look and get their input on that but I think you're grinding is going to be effective and\nThat's lab is thick enough and it's going to be successful and be less expensive\nOkay the second question I got is that when these two slabs rose uh [noise] we had two problems that have one is that where is that for your construction joint\nThe construction joint spoiled and it's probably at the crack probably maybe about an inch max someplace to just three quarter of an inch and probably about an inch and a half white ...\nAnd that's the way from the joint or just on the edge of the joint\nIt it starts at the joint and then go back in ah probably about thirty forty feet\n[noise] um you could do that with a type of mortar I'd talked about a political zip it mortar which is a I'm In it may not be enough he may have to just go with mortar and just added in Egypt do it but the zip it mortar is designed to have the slump where it can be applied to a vertical surface",
