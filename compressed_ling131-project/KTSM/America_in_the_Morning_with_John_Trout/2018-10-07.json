I don't know how that outlet is wired for a lot of times we always we blame that outlet\nBut really in effect it's doing its job and I know when it got kind of like a building circuit breaker when it detects a short or straight electricity it shut off off yeah and I had one quite honestly that would go off and it turned out\nIt was wired were protected not only that outlet but it protected numerous other outlets down the line and I had an outlet that was on the outside of the house that was kind of on that same branch and it was it was outside in the weather proofing plate\nOf the the the part that was the weatherproof seeing the little something it disintegrated\nOut it was getting moisture in there which was causing that whole circuit to go out and it wouldn't reset Mm So I don't know how they borrowed it whether it's just that particular thing mhm um or there's another outlet that is um\nYou know causing the problem yeah I'm\nGetting a out I Would have to check a electrician to come in yes I live in our crime that\nI Will certainly have that checked out and see what's ... what's going on there yeah 'cause\nI I don't know why that little red light would be on bite you plug in things and it's not working\nI mean to me that indicates okay fine because it popped out a couple of times recently like that um it makes me worry\nAnd you've got circuit breakers in the house yeah and the circuit breakers on ... yeah it was nothing went off nothing went off it's just that outlet yeah yeah well there's something that's a whole\nLot to do that either a shorter moisture or something along those lines whether it's just that outlet or other another outlet that's causing the problem which you'd have to track down mhm um I Can't answer but probably a good thing if it's been a trouble spot probably not a bad idea to get it checked out\nYeah and I'm worried about fire but we don't have any thing we can do like the ... in that room talents arming bathroom\nSo you know loose wires can cause it so yeah you know you need to check it out it's not that outlet it's probably something that's causing that outlet to do what it's designed to do yeah okay All right that's right I
