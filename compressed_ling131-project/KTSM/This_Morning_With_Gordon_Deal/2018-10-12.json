{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "And I don't know I kind of think it will but I I don't know I'm optimistic I'm going to stay on the line because I Know you're going to have questions and I want to get a few legs and because\nI when I started twenty three sixty thinks the path\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more fluent accounts\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured\nUm except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and got may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there too onerous we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than health care\nThere on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans\nThen people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going this bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nSounds in one way to bail out everything would be people like a hundred thousand dollars to buy some good what do you think\nWhat will hit the I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think\nThey should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly and the great depression but to put it on a permanent\nQuantitative easing just for birds the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nInto rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send period to to to get us out of the at least send the money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if they sent everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but\nIt would have helped people instead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted to volunteer as opposed to check you know he really is because I wanted them to be forced to spend the red line them you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and have them spend that money or to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George an area that question you mentioned earlier about the banks and you're making it and just now but uh the taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank because that's where all the leverage is been there was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot\nPeople a lot a lot of the problems which forms were over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money to buy this is totally money center bank thing\nAnd and also when you do if they if governments have to ask for money or pork how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the end the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThan you know bank of America or Wells Fargo or sitting back and stuff like\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara in North Carolina\nOr tell yeah okay thank you\nAnd I think yeah I just answered that part of one of my questions but the more I asked\nA direct them I I I got one right apart and in my account why I'm not quite a few more weight on your client\nYup they put all about timing huh\nIt's all about timing what am I guardian angel moments I call it um what part of it you just answered my question what\nAbout the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much um I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger account hold her is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure Social Security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more fluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected at whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agree that they can insured deposits and they can't insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can ensure everything if you have a major club but the smaller accounts it'd be spread out a few cows and you have more money and your brokerage accounts which they can't get out\nYeah sure going to be less vulnerable and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounting those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hit and of course when when things go bad people gonna hit foreign depositors more Iceland\nWent down and basically all the foreign depositors in foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans\nAnd business loans go back there going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash in it\nThey can't they can't pledge doses reserves\nAnd

cycle you can hear that report on our website this morning with Gordon Deal dot com or on places like SoundCloud I tuned pitcher in tune in just search for him this morning [laughter]\nWhere do we stand on the Trump terrorists Yahoo Finance columnist or ... new man has been doing a deep dive by talking to business owners on the front lines and joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of the battery business in Texas\nSurveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight as to get their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment or alternate heirs and starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit for he's a he sees the terrorists from both sides so um he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses in his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment\nBut he also favors the terrorists because she competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China so the price of competing product is going to go up\nA and he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him raise his own prices eventually him pay for the higher cost peas and himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as simple as some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher\n[noise] it's a I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs\nShow you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases their pay either a ten percent ... now an additional temper center works on the twenty five percent tariff also the steel and aluminum tariffs\nOn a flight not just to imports from China but from most countries so a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ten percent\n... percent more for that product and at some point you're going to have to raise his own prices\nAh in order to cover that increase in cost\nBut you know there if you're a if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well as my customer going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without of sending my customers away\nSo what he plans to do is he going to eat the it out and cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also and he says well not product goes up the price that's what he's going to raise prices so ah all prices will kind of go off at the same time\nWe're speaking with a Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the terrorists\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about this she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before\nHe got the notification from his own supplier that his own costs are going up by the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn a because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact um I got notified by my own fires the my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the Trump terrorists are and what are the point she made is that in his business he has seen a lot of busy us businesses small businesses such as his own just disappear\nBecause ah they cannot compete with\nA with cheap imported products from China\nAnd in many cases they make the case that the imported products are low quality products that there\nAre there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consider you're getting something inferior but a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know when the ... you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products\nSo he's one of these people who feels that the Trump terrorists may actually rectify a longstanding problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThanks that's Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman's\nPortion of the program is brought to buy Harry's

... thanks for\nJoining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura could just do the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere at four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that is a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes ... percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I Am a I'm a little bit younger I even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be a deeper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a shift for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the six percent is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a center that it has been in the past and I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw\nA huge run up in prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below a where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing above price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more\nExpensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prices are still high um but I Do think for a virus that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war as in cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market\nThat has really cold and so I think for buyers who want a little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down were to bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise] thanks Laura Laura ... of the wall Street Journal\nFortunate the program is brought you buy Brooklyn and did you know

school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend to know how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty to state and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school district so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\n[noise] you know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as fewer absences that would be a huge one\n[noise] yes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that\nThese districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with financial hub through the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they are when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat that each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I've found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the school on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals a nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some\nVery poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use for day [noise]\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love

stand on the Trump terrorists Yahoo Finance columnist or ... new man has been doing a deep dive by talking to business owners on the front lines and joins us now tell us what you found out about talking to the owner of the battery business in Texas\nSurveying a lot of different business owners here we go fight as to get their opinions on the terrorists\nAre some don't like them but some actually do like them and one of the guys I interviewed was a guy named queen Robinson who run the company in Texas that rebuilds or industrial equipment uh alternatives and starters on automobiles and on um some bigger equipment used in the ... energy industry\nAnd he's getting hit for he's a he sees the terrorists from both sides so um he's he has to pay more now for some materials that he uses his business which is rebuilding or some of this equipment\nBut he also favors the terrorists because she competes against a new equipment new alternatives and starters that are made in China so the price of competing product is going to go up\nAnd he thinks that's going to help his business eventually he thinks that may actually help him rage his own prices eventually ... pay for the higher cost peas and himself because his own costs have gone up on account of the terrorists so it's complicated I mean that you know the waiters plays out in the real world\nIs not nearly as simple as some of the sound bite you might hear politicians are spouting on TV\n[noise] what kinds of price supplies um is he looking at it is it that the ten percent or higher [noise]\nIt's a I think the ones that are affecting him that the cost increases affecting him or the steel and aluminum tariffs show you know he buys some parts from suppliers who in turn to get their stuff from China or a show in some cases they're paying either a ten percent ...\nNow an additional temper center works on the twenty five percent tariff also the steel and aluminum tariffs\nOr apply not just to imports from China but from most countries so a imported steel and aluminum is getting more expensive so he got he got notified by one supplier or the price that the price of the product if he needs to purchase is going up ten percent\n... percent more for that product and at some point you're going to have to raise his own prices\nA in order to cover that increasing costs\nBut you know there if you're a if you're the seller in this case you have to figure out well it's my customer going to pay the extra money and how do I sort of carefully raise my prices without of sending my customers away\nSo what he plans to do is he going to eat the ad in cost until he sees the competing products going up in price which it has to do because it's getting more expensive also and he says well not product goes up the price that is what he's going to raise prices so ah all prices what kind of go up at the same time\nWe're speaking with that Yahoo columnist Rick Newman Rick in talking to this gentleman could you tell it all it's his feelings have changed in either direction on the tariffs\n[laughter] that's interesting because when he first um reached out to me saying he'd be happy to talk about that she was totally in favor of the terrorists and that was before\nHe got the notification from his own supplier that his own costs are going up by the time I actually talked to him he said well there's been an interesting turn a because yesterday and he said Mr he said yesterday in fact\nUm I got notified by my own fires my costs are going up so I'm paying more on account of the terrorists but I think it's going to help\nOr on the retail and he said look I still favor the Trump terrorists are and what are the point she made is that it his business he has seen a lot of the U.S businesses small businesses such just\nDisappear because uh they cannot compete with a with cheap imported products from China\nAnd in many cases they make the case that the imported products are low quality products that there are there they're not built to last um that you get you know if you're the consider you're getting something inferior but a lot of times uh you just don't know that or you don't care and you know when the ... you have to make at some point in time you just have to go with the cheaper products\nSo he's one of these people who feels that the Trump terrorists may actually rectify a longstanding problem with the demise of all these businesses in the United states\nThinks that the finance columnist Rick Newman's\nPortion of the program is ... by Harry's you've heard Gordon talked for years
