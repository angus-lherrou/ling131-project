aren't that that does not that type of thing there in the panhandle of Florida\n... ... you know it it is it's a different animal altogether but most people don't really realize yes New Orleans was the big\nThe big element of that storm but actually Katrina hit Mississippi and a New Orleans just had the flooding aspect of what the focus is if you remember the levees breached a it was the uh water situation water problem is is a pretty much a a wind related storm\nI Know in in the Pensacola desolate area got less at one point five inches of rain um but it was really I write maker but you really can't compare the two in terms of the immediate damage\nKatrina water a Michael it was when I get\nTo give me ... to me about thirty seconds here Chris on why just out of curiosity that region there that Mexico beach area has gone on developed or is not overrun with tourists when it's so pretty\nWell because a development in terms of real estate development beaches bottle you know the beaches from Pensacola is toward the Panama City the most beautiful white pictures of the world\nAbsolutely but once you get a little bitty to Panama City beach tech your change is a different color not same white and it's\nA it's more of a\nKind of a wind related coastline ah with with trees and things like that it's just not the same as the beach developed communities the panhandle to the

Mexico Beach Florida yesterday ranked as the strongest storm to hit that region since at least eight teen fifty one when recordkeeping began\nMore now from Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel is with us lives morning ... jobs and just how bad was Michael\n... morning Gordon yeah it's not every day that you see a category for making us landfall but uh you know Michael was pretty impressive and that uh you know a lot of these hurricanes when they approach the u._s. do tend to either hold serve or the week it a little bit as they approach land but Michael Woods\nIntensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was was making Lincoln for [noise] so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and do they give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record Andrew Camille in uh Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so this was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... ... ... north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened hereby rain\n[laughter] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is no just over a year or go to Georgia and it spread it all of its rain into a parts of the Carolinas\nThe Appalachians and ah over the next twenty four hours it'll just moved a pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas in the southeast Virginia and spread some rain\nOr as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a show these New England may produce an inch rain or so on its northern play give to our New York city in Philadelphia but\nFortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[laughter] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans you've been hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively lower population swam in the floor and they'll still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there is a small solace of relief that is certainly as far as the the the the overall damage figure from this instead of hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nOr why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that that shouldn't be the case you to Florida is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time to\nPack up [laughter]\nYeah I mean part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so uh so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this that you just put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance of but\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect a borderline cat five later today so I think that may have been a factor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks [laughter] well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay buried in Central America that could be a flood threat so you don't see any us threats\nOver the next week or so but again the hurricane seasons don't go into November early so could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the worst of the hurricanes the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still get big hurricanes and tropical storms early in the seat in the late in the city but uh there's certainly a prime time it's almost like the kind of race in baseball\nAlmost mats of exactly what that\nHad a good hey I thanks for a few minutes as always appreciated in crisis situations we call an

S. still tend to either hold serve or the week it a little bit as they approach land but Michael Woods\nIntensifying just as it was getting toward land in fact the lightning and it's I was was making it for so yeah this was almost a category five hurricane and do they give you a perspective on that\nOr they're only been three a continental US category five hurricane on record in Camille in ... Florida Keys Nineteen thirty five Labor Day hurricane so\nThis was a ... this was one intense hurricane landfall\nBoy and and the the aftermath now is what this thing is ... moved north east across George a writer or the Carolinas threatened hereby rain\n[noise] yeah that's right right now ah the center of Michael is now just over a or your Augusta, Georgia and it spread it all of the rain into a part of the Carolinas\nMia Appalachians and or over the next twenty four hours it'll just blew up pretty quickly to the northeast across the Carolinas\nIn the southeast Virginia and spread some rain or as well along parts of the north east seaboard including a south east New England they produce an inch rain or so on its northern ... to a New York city Philadelphia\nBut fortunately by friday or this thing will finally be able to see will be done with it\nI think this compares to some of those other big storms I feel like it's slightly different because it didn't hit a major metropolitan area\n[noise] well that's true you know uh you know with apologies the Florida Panhandle you know it's it's um you know if you think about the places where hurricane could hit and do the most damage a big of the places where Michael didn't get it didn't hit New Orleans it didn't hit Tampa\nOr they need Houston uh so it's a it's a relatively low a population swat in the floor and they'll still hit very hard\nBut ah I guess if there is a small solar relieve is certainly as far as the beep beep the overall damage figure from this instead of hit a relatively unpopulated area the Gulf Coast\nYeah why such a little time to evacuate as some people say to Florida radio show host on earlier said that that shouldn't be the case you to report is good about giving people a Seventy two hour window but I was surprised that some people said they didn't have time\nThe pack up [noise] yeah I mean part of it as part of it is due to becoming so intense so uh so close to land fall you know it just kept intensifying intensify and that's something we we never liked to see but certainly the national Hurricane Center National Weather service had a watches and warnings out well ahead of this that you just put\nA watches out a good forty eight hours ahead of time and uh we we knew this thing was coming you know a good three or four days in advance of but\nI think the intensity and ferocity of it\nUh you know I I personally did not expect the borderline get five later today so I think that'd be a benefactor\nThat's something we're speaking live this morning with Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel I hate to even ask when you and I have these conversations what's the rest of the season look like either I don't know next couple of days or weeks well\nYou know we still have about six weeks of the hurricane season left that typically goes to the end of November ah right now there's a there's a couple of systems on the central eastern Atlantic not worry about it was the dean\nA there could be some develop in the western Caribbean next week or that will probably stay up buried in Central America that could be a flood threats so you don't see any us threats over the next week or so but again the hurricane season and go into November leaks do could get a surprise here and there\nYeah you know I was I was thinking about this the other day the hurricane season runs June through November Man that's half the year but the concentration of this stuff the worst stuff seems to be my wrong like September October\n[noise] no you're absolutely right or really the peak of the hurricane season are usually goes for about the last um the last two weeks of August through early October that's when you get the worst of the hurricanes the biggest threat to the United states\nOr just because of the warm water in the low wind shear that's when the ... that's when you tend to see the peak impact we can still get big hurricanes and tropical storms earlier this evening late in the city but uh there's certainly a prime time it's almost like the kind of race in baseball almost mats of exactly with that\nHer to good hey I thanks for a few minutes has always appreciated in crisis situations we call on Jonathan urban senior digital meteorologist at the weather channel twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "El Paso", "day": "11"}
