we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads and races were pretty close and Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee who's been treated unfairly\nThey believe that the media has not covered him partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations in and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so\nThat has at least for the time being been a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their\nDesire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous polling that Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans and Republicans in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nMm All right so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on Tuesday as I'm\nA big one as we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp one of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh hurt Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nA we're now in the upper single digits in terms of his lead in the polling averages a you know that was a race it's been close has been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen\nI think we've seen also a ... has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch a Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls that still there was a recent CNN poll that they'd have her up three but in the polling averages he's clinging to have a very narrow lead\nAnd this could be a a race that's influenced by by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with the Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\n[noise] oh definitely I I you know it's always a a very political process and it's become much more so in recent years says each party has begun to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance and the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections where Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump\nThey dislike what Republicans are doing a Washington seems to them or like another power grab a bite narrow Republican majority is at a at a president that was the popular vote\nFor Republicans I mean a major factor in why they voted for Trump in the first place was rewarded conservative judges they cared about who was controlling the Supreme Court they didn't want Antonin Scalia's seat in particular to go to a liberal staff Anthony Kennedy's seat go to a more reliable conservative potentially\nA really does deliver a pretty big promise to many of the voters who turned out for Trump and twenty sixteen and so this could be a real motivating factor for them to show up in the mid term election so it really is something that energizes both sides to a certain extent\nWhen Jim Jim mantle
