it's been around right don't end by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now watch here's Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season or they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise is able to get dumped on the market right in the middle of a holiday season\nUh they have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with Toys R us Scott depresses the whole retail market\nSo which ... the lessons here or what they missed out going online what\nColor the way through high yeah they took on a huge amount of that they had five point six billion dollars in debt a on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment they couldn't make which is what kind of ...\nUh the chapter eleven filing um they had too many assets as far as all these stores all over the place that will not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost Amazon but they lost of other places as well and Home Depot\nAnd various other people took their their market share it's been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share and two thousand seven down to panic is now yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just didn't keep up with a ...\nWhat what could have saved them as they say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe nineties\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively or keeping up the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions a competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise] uh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployees of the high cost space it it really would have been hard for them to survive in this very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what's the thing about steers too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now do they sort of live in fear\nI think so I mean the stores have not been a popular anyway so they've been an actor but an identity crisis\nThose places will be we developed\nA maybe feathers stores maybe for other purposes I mean those gems in restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be the space will be repurposed but it's going to be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the holidays is probably liquidate them all so that's eight hundred and twenty large stores\nOr that will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the America's money answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing it very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in\nAnd they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk out but I Know exactly where the snow cashiers whatsoever so\nUh and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing it in a much more strategic way with much more limited inventory in select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a chore into many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to the when credible low prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all the things the fears office [noise] yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is going to take cells away from other traditional retailers\nWho probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from other figure stores will\nWe still know the Sears brand than a year five years and now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example and he left for rent fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been sold out so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear over time\nNext Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's

about Fifteen hundred people living in them\nAnd there were ten thousand people at AT T coil\nBut we also have um at Seventy five emergency response vehicles and their ... around the affected area and

leave they they don't pack up and go home because they are home and um yeah we\nWe just stay until people find a place you go we still have that that four hundred people in shelters in the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence all is that right yeah yeah\nMan so you know this is a difficult period I ... I think generally speaking like stories now start not to get told right the media begins to pull away from affected areas as they start to focus on other breaking news uh does this become more difficult for the volunteers\n[noise] well um it becomes more difficult really for everyone um because\nUh you know we need help and we always need volunteers um you know those those um Thirteen

whether they're giving us financial gifts to wear\nA donating their time to volunteer and I'm sadly Gordon um we had a a cancel a lot of blood drive between Hurricane Florence and hurricane\nMichael because a lot of them were scheduled in those areas\nAnd um we were looking at a bit of a blood shortage right now so we're also encouraging people to donate blood if they're willing to get the gift of life\nAnd you're speaking this morning with Gail McGovern president and CEO of the American Red Cross what's the what's the greatest need at this point is that the blood is it the more volunteers money\nUm yes yes and yeah I Know that\nUm you know what we're really focusing on is providing food shelter water um we're helping people figure out how to navigate through this you know some people\nJust barely got out of their homes and that they need their a prescription and treat them well they might have lost their\nTheir eye glasses says the red cross does all of that and um we

Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know\nWondering that Senator Cruz said not relied on an ass but that he was able to rely on and get help with was the party establishment kind of coming in and helping them out you know the vice president making money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down to campaign for him ah so you know Senator Cruz is sort of the quintessential outsider candidate got to get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party to stabilize the rates and make it to you know give him an edge on that in Texas\nAnd how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting what I think your caller from countries and supporters his hardcore supporters that they would argue that you know he's the conservatives are bent but he always was God he's still\nYou know given abandoned his values one of one of the folks that I talked to from Texas comments actually you know Ted Cruz a changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate you'd see a collapsing to support a\nAnd that's not really what's happening is that he's just\nNot help ease the more collaborative he's from a bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters has\nGot it what are the are as you said the pieces campaign ... earlier this year or what why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I think the thing about that orchids he taught us money and he basically out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that you know thousands of people\nWho were going to and and he he kind of sort of a little bit of a movement um and he was on TV before entering the without sending cruise on TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be out fending and outrage in at a Republican in Texas especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so\nI just started a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact and I think his campaign and not looking from Texas kicked into high gear towards the end of summer and and going into the fall kind of realized that they ate the challenge and and you know they've they've stepped it up and call in shows that that Ted Cruz of weeding pretty clear he's not running away with it\nBut he's got a healthy or he said lead\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to kick it and again they were having a child from better over any rich thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter wow that is just an absolute record\nFor speak with James Oregon Senate campaign reporter for political he's written a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz sanded down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act you know high profile Republican tide turkey on it for a pack and you remember famously had cruised shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to ... you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really use any sort of outside\nPressure force on the public and in fact the capital to force their hand and he did successfully forced their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and folks in the capital\nAnd to the the new time around in twenty Seventeen he was a meeting with Republican senator he's working very closely with his colleague he wasn't there\nAnd bombed up that he tried to get a and you know they were unsuccessful but they were unsuccessful you know not because of the Senator Cruz because it involves a bomb the way that he had previously and\nYou were quoted a Republican consultant in your story who said something to the effect of that a bed or federal Rourke had become like Ted Cruz of this election almost like he was taking a page from cruises playbook\nIn a sense it's it's funny you know a T get some pushback from Republicans and you try to better working outside or because he's been in politics are more than a decade in and out of the house I'm honored and but he's he's running this kind of campaign against you know the average met again politics as usual against the way things are usually done in Washington\nAnd so he

extra spending\nTime with is the country's largest retailer\nAt one point Sears has filed for bankruptcy around since Eighteen eighty six it's been around right done in by the great recession and more recently the rise of online retail sites like Amazon and others so now what's your Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man Jordan what's ahead\nWell it's going to be a big downer for the holiday season uh they're going to be liquidating lots of stores are probably at least a hundred and fifty stores and then all the merchandise has got to get dumped on the market right in the middle of a holiday season\nThey have about Seventy thousand workers good number of those will be laid off just kind of what happened earlier this year with toys R. us and it just got off the presses the whole retail market\nSo which Sears the lessons here or what they missed out going on line with\nThe way through high yeah they took on a huge amount of debt they had five point six billion dollars in debt or on Monday they have a hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment they couldn't make which is what kind of ...\nUh the chapter eleven filing [noise] um they had too many assets as far as all these stores all over the place that will not kept up well\nPeople just didn't go to theaters anymore and they they lost Amazon but they lost of other places as well yeah Home Depot\nAnd various other people that took their their market share it's been around for a hundred and twenty five years I mean they had a real run at its peak the stock for example is a hundred and twenty dollars a share in two thousand seven down to panic is now yeah so it it was one of the great American companies that just to keep up with the times\nWhat a what could have saved them as they say I don't know what's starting in the eighties maybe they were probably some critical decisions that were Mr maybe Ninety\nI'm certainly going online much more aggressively uh keeping up the stores are keeping up with the latest fashions a competing more aggressively with the company is going after them whether it be Home Depot or clothing stores [noise] uh but it was it's a huge company that I have a lot of\nEmployees of the high cost space it would've been hard for them to survive with is very brutal retail environment\nYou know what what's the thing about fears too is is that the fact that they anchor so many malls what about those malls now do they sort of live in fear\nI think so I mean the story of not that popular anyway so that that an accurate but a a debit card you might say those places will be we developed a maybe for the stores maybe for other purposes I mean those\nIn restaurants all kinds of things that come into these places [noise] um so ... even Amazon Amazon starting to open stores though so that's purpose will be at the space will be repurposed but it's gonna be a big drag on a lot of malls I'm currently have\nA total of about eight hundred and twenty stores both ears and Kmart and that they're going to close a hundred and fifty pretty soon\nThey're in chapter eleven reorganization but if they don't do well enough to the Saudis is probably liquidate the mall for about eight hundred and twenty large stores\nThat will be liquidated on the market including all their inventory\nAnd speak with Jordan Goodman personal finance experts at money answers dot com he's known as the\nMoney answers man we're talking about the Sears bankruptcy filing how about the irony by the way of Amazon actually opening brick and mortar stores\nYeah well uh they're doing in a very selective way they do these Amazon Go stores where you go in and they know who you are you just take things off the shelf they walk out but I Know exactly where the snow cashiers whatsoever so\nUh and they're doing all the best of what Amazon offers its own products and so and so it is an irony but they're doing is much more strategic way with much more limited inventory in select locations fears just got too big and had too much of a chore into many big stories of people didn't want to go to\nIf you're a savvy shopper are you preparing to pounce on what Sears may have to offer\n[noise] yeah I mean the products are good and and yes I think you're going to fail incredible prices for appliances electronics and clothes and all things with the IRS offers yes I think people will go up there and clean the place out with them which is a tech sales away from other traditional retailers\nWho probably have to compete maybe you'll see lower prices from Walmart and target and other places to compete with this huge liquidation from other figure stores will\nWe still know the Sears brand than a year five years and now\nNot really I I it's not going to be around I mean some of the individual brands Kenmore for example and he left but he ran fears are bought that for four hundred million dollars um they've got some brands but most of the brands have been solved so I think the fears name itself is probably going to disappear overtime\nThanks Jordan Jordan Goodman known as America's money answers man\nMore to the program is\nBrought to you by light
