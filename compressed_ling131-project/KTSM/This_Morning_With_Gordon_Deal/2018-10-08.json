think that even if you are listening to this show tonight and you believe that there are aliens or ... or however you want to describe them that are coming here and you think they must be good because if they weren't good they would've destroyed is already if you're in charge of the military\nIf your job is to be suspicious if your job is to protect the people of your country\nThen why would you take a chance and say okay well maybe these beings are benevolent but still why don't we do with ever we can to have whatever we can muster together in place just in case\nYou don't you need to send ourselves because they have a change of heart or they've been deceiving\nThem to be safe than sorry right\nWhy sure you know and and we it might be Utah I'll I mean you would think that it would be that if the if there are beings out there that are coming here that are are so advanced that they um they they ... you know would otherwise destroy is\nAh if you know if if that was their plan but on you know here's this is getting dark this is this is very dark but I honestly this is a logical point of view what if George\n... if they were going to come back here these beings that ancient alien a theorists\nTalk about talk about this kind of thing many times on the History Channel um\nIf they they come back and they want to and slave us again\nBecause a lot of people believe especially if you look at like Zacharias ... work and all that that they came here and modified our our genetics in our DNA to enslave us and treat us as minors for gold or whatever\nIf their goal is to come back here and in slavery was it might be a better fate for us to commit global suicide in other words and again I told you this is going to be dark what if a lot of these governments\nHave some kind of plan in place where they say rather than have these beings come back and put you know colors on us and and work like animals we hit these buttons and we just annihilate ourselves spooky but what if that's the case\nSo do stay button basically\nAnd and and that the idea is that we're not necessarily as concerned about each other as we are about the force from outside and you're going back to Ronald Reagan I'm I'm sure you recall that kind of eerie comment that he made\nA one of his speeches I Believe it might've been before the un\nYou know what if there was an alien threat [laughter] what\nDid he really mean by that you know he was he was just being facetious to try to talk to people about banning together or does he really knows something at the time\nWhen you look back at all of these people who have made deathbed confessions who are related to Roswell and um you know the whole suspicion that surrounds researchers to this day who goes snooping a little too much and digging a little too deep [noise]\nI mean there is something to this idea that we may be up against potentially a some visitors here if you want to call them visitors they call them are just as easily invaders but\nThere may be some some ah beings\nThat we have got to do our best to defend against\nAnd they're using space time manipulating technology in order to completely I'm Out maneuver anything that we can do and so what\nOnce we see it possible examples like I'm perhaps predicting that maybe now we humans are experimenting with stuff\nSadly enough weaponry which also may have a space time manipulating effect\nUh this could be a particularly worrisome for those beings if they say okay we made a little trade off we gave them if you little nuggets of wisdom but boy the the the earthlings are run with it and so we need to put them back on their play\nJosh tell us about your event coming up in October this month\nYeah fake it which this Saturday it's October the thirteenth is going to be my final

[noise]\nAnd uh [noise] from what I gather it was about Fifteen minutes wrong and President Trump spoke for the vast majority of those fifty minutes and you know the phone call was described to me I could just picture his voice right you know\nYou're talking about how beautiful how excellent things are going to be now things are going to be different now uh you know don't worry about everything's amazing the passes fast things are good\nAnd you know and you see the way he's he's a he's talking even publicly um something people haven't really picked up on is you know talking about how our continent as being ripped off also a look at some of the dining seems frustrations a leading up to the moment where there was a deal\nI Know you mentioned a ... as kind of one of the items on a potential to do is we'll be regulatory streamlining anything I'd jump out as one of the ... yeah she was\nYeah I'll give an example so the for years now or the governments are um [noise] I've been working on this thing called the regulatory Cooperation Council\nAnd the idea is as follows I'll give you one specific example of how I understand it\nSo the different countries have different rules for Britain products to market which is normal every country has its own sovereign right the ... but sometimes those differences are so tiny and so insignificant but the cause big problems right so let's stick to lipstick\nCost something like eight hundred bucks to bring the market in the United states\nAnd Canada it costs I forgot what it was it was like Fifteen hundred two hundred thousand dollars I don't I don't remember the exact number I'll be honest\nBut it's a lot of money and the reason it cost that much it's going to Canada a lipstick with best yeah flecks on some protection U.

elections get closer and closer in November that Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken off\nFive more than even the supporters of it expected like they were they taught us as something more for the twenty twenty presidential elections and\nEmblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive policy is such a Medicare for all and then you have some of the more centrist Democrats crash especially in conservative\nStates that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle at the debate is playing out right now boy who support this\nWell I'm a ... this is obviously the idea was first I'm kind of brought forward by Bernie Sanders and his idea of a really it Medicare for all that is that single payer\nHas now at this point a gardener um sixteen actually Fifteen caused by church because Al Franken just

think you see 'em a individuals like men for example who ran who didn't fully come out in support of Medicare for all you see people like I'm In West Virginia\nWho are a mansion who is um you know taking a much more cautious approach a number of candidates who are saying look what we really need to do is fix the Affordable CARE Act and build on that versus kind of throwing out I'm the baby with the bathwater\n... speaking with Wall Street journal healthcare policy reporter Stephanie Armour or ... some Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan itself play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the support is strikingly high around Seventy percent but yeah that Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interests that brings Sanders plant in the form of single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think I'm Single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I Do think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all isn't even among the Democrat\nThey're widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare's want the option even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that what was going to hit the road as it goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace the AC a that's not an easy task\nIs there a perception among those who support Medicare for all that the government is good at running programs\nI don't know if they would go so far as to say it's a good at running program that I think they they are building on the popularity of Medicare itself which has high\nApproval rating summits

to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com ... what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment in our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this is a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strains from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers ah but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with Mark Emmert senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the\nSeptember jobs report um does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one that's of average right so that's the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a full informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience do you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good places well\nWhen the when it comes to looking for jobs there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left I\nThink the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh\nThe ... you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend it a another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact ah but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch when that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what the next presidential election\nSmart mark ...

Obama to make campaign but the question for Mr O'Rourke it protects Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from ... past election can opt to show up in numbers proportionate to their show of the population but trouble elections when turnout goes away down compared to presidential years uh and so a campaign and then Texas Democrats think that\nUh they have a surgeon voter turnout or like what I was in my ... and to have made or similar to what President Trump did with white working class voters are not college educated voters\nIs sixteen but there's not so far a lot of evidence already hard data to show that that's going to be the case\nAnd it was it it'd be interesting uh data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nBut tend to be a little more Republican than a fax around the country and getting twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of touch with Hispanics for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are surely gerrymandered to get as many Democrats as possible and then and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for all races uh you know and so that the general elections have been a cake walk short one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add on to that there really hasn't been a competitive statewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a\nPolitical machinery to get folks out to vote or the ... campaign has had to build that on the fly over the course of the last year and a half\nA and whether there'll be able to do it\nUh in time for November six of the big question\nI'm speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein is written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but he's voters to not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you ask a Mr O'Rourke he'll tell you that nobody's going to ask for a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having visited all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the ... the big state\nUh and somebody's counties are very small uh some of the county is that\nIt is that I was a bit in Texas twice this year to visit him a C and campaigning and uh in February when I was down there he was visiting counties a inch having more people show up is to see him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties a and so\nHe thinks that he's able to draw\nA people out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason for them to court because Texas has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trail is that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or he can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is by his house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the campaign trail is drawn enormous numbers of people\nUh the evidence that he can get that the show up at the polls or at least is not grounded in in his own electoral history a you know his ... house district is one of the twenty ... twenty lowest turnout

health law polling indicates that no issue is more important to voters and healthcare and Wall Street journal reporter Stephanie Armour says this internal tension carries risk Stephanie what are we seeing\nWell actually what you've seen is as the mid term elections get closer and closer in November the Medicare for all it's an idea has really taken\nOff five more than even the supporters of it except it like they were they taught us that something more for the twenty twenty presidential elections and emblematic of the struggle going on right now within the Democratic party be you have sort of the more liberal side is wanting to do more aggressive\nPolicy is such a Medicare for all and then you had him at the Marshall Democrat crash especially in conservative\nStates that are like whoa we do this we could\nAlienate some of our more kind of a centrist democratic voters so that's really the the the battle and the debate that's playing out right now\nBoy who support this ah well I'm

Democrats want Medicare for all others aren't so sure how much of a role by the way those the slogan it's self play Medicare rule versus say the phrase single payer system\nYeah that that's a good question when you when the parents go out and ask people voters about Medicare for all the step toward a strikingly high around Seventy percent but yeah the Medicare for all that\nHas gotten the most interest that brings me there's plan to form a single parent is single payer and so if you ask people what they think up single payer as a form of health care that that dropped precipitously show I think some of this is quite frankly a lot of people don't really know what Medicare for all its and even among the Democrat\nThey're widening support for more watered down version such as allowing people to buy into Medicare's want the option even though they're technically not I'm old enough\nSo that kind of where I think that what was going to hit the road as it goes forward as Democrats are going to have to come to some kind of consensus on what they mean what they want and as we saw with Republicans and their efforts to repeal and replace a theater that's not an easy task\nIs there a
