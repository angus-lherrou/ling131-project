at the beginning [laughter]\nUm but no that that's that I couldn't tell from that from that description of may have written that\nDidn't one step beyond pop up after twilight zone\nYes uh yes out the outer limits came after the twilight zone as well but no actually wants to be on I Believe actually perceive the twilight zone by ear I'm Out I'm In this came after we but I Believe a one step beyond

understand human nature 'cause if you listen to a lot of his episodes and I've got every one of them and I ... about every two months\nYou know everyone wanted his shows has a point to it but he's trying to point to you know and I think it's because of the experiences at a combat soldier during World War two which I you know it was all about the the Nazi movement and all of that you know\nAnd the everything you've been through one of my favorite episodes it's hard to say which is my favorite but I think it has to be the one that's to be twenty five Mitchell twin engine bomber coming over from Italy crashes\nIn the desert the capital of that airplane didn't go on that mission for whatever reason which was Robert coming Bob comings I'm Sorry ... and up bop companies just happened to be walking by and seen his newspaper of his airplane they had found laying in the desert\nAnd he went back in time where you went back to the desert in his mind\nAnd we live the experience even though he didn't fly that mission you know and or any I ended up in a hospital room\nAnd having psychiatric care trying to find out you know what caused him they had a nervous breakdown and it was because the shock\nOf seeing an airplane on the newspaper just recently you know and when they when the show ended close to the ending of it the nurse bodies clothing out there and she said well there's sand in his shoes\nAnd so somehow or another he really transport himself back in time to be twenty five ... crashed you know struggling with those shows that Ross darling did\nHe had a time machine you know one of them this guy you know went back in time three different times and he thought he would try to after events that took place one of them was just thinking of the Titanic\nThe guy went back tried to tried to change that well he failed\nIt one time you went back and tried to stop the uh Japanese from being annihilated in Hiroshima trying to warn them that didn't do any good he got thrown in jail for his efforts on that so I went back and he ended up in Nazi Germany that already thought he could alter that event\nOf course\nBut a man I don't know it'd be hard to say which be my favorite episode the the the Christmas Story the guy that played art Carney played the ah Santa Claus in a department store and that call Cowell was his name he wanted to be the biggest gift giver of all times the guy was all a shrine\nHand when he got a break from the department store he went and got drunk came back he was setting up on the chairs little boy jumped up in his lap\nSanta Claus just it was two grown man I mean he fell out of the chair on the floor you know where she got fired and everything he went outside and he was all down down and he went and a back alley and picked up a bag and it turned into gifts mysteriously bag just all of a sudden became full of gifts and did it uh you know empty cans\nAnd he went around giving gifts to everybody and it just and that story\nYou know and the guy who ran a department store they found call well given these gifts out at this a place like a John free sixteen mission type place you know policeman comes in here and goes where'd you get all these kids to get a receipt for all these gift blah blah blah and he goes no I just I found the bag and the gives rent it and I'm just giving them out\nLooking at the PlayStation and the department store owner came in here so yeah there it is there is the merchandise call well you're the Bob I'll buy you know\nAnd ah the guy's name was Mr done department store owner right and uh and they need to step out of the bag at the police station there wasn't nothing but empty can it right\nAnd so they had to let him go of course the store owner sitting here scratch your head the policemen scratches it couldn't figure out where all those gift recover from it they were coming out that bag\nSo just before they released a coal oil Santa Claus he reached in the bag and grab a bottle of wine Nineteen thirty three and handed it to Mr\nGundy huh you know say merry Christmas and\nBoth of them got pretty toasted on wine and they walked outside and they seemed Santa Claus flying overhead and a slave with reindeer\nAnd ... and that right there just catches my heart Everytime\nI live in you as you mentioned something about cans and remember kick the can Nicholas\nOh sure sure yeah kick the can and

divisions again you know because the way the mid term is shaping up and and by the way you know they're still three weeks ago and that that's an eternity in American politics today so [laughter]\nPredictions are very dangerous but if you were to take a snapshot today you'd say it looks as if the picture's improving somewhat for Republicans but Democrats probably still have the or in a good position to take back control of the house because a lot of those house races are playing out to the swing races are playing out in suburban\nDistricts where they're Democrats are stronger and wears a college educated suburban women I've become a very strong democratic constituency so they seem to be a good position to take back control of the house but at the same time\nRepublicans look as if they're in better shape to keep control the Senate\nOr in some measure because the Republican base was very unhappy with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated as a Supreme Court nominee and that has kind of energized the Republican base and reminded them that they like having Republicans pick and confirmed judges and so\nUh the balance in the Senate will be determined in a bunch of red states where there's a lot of pro Trump support and so\nYou're going to have a you could very well end up with a picture of a divided Congress and Democrats thinking that they uh have one they are a national vote in essence the same way they did when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote\nIn twenty sixteen but don't have a very big hold on political power if they simply have one half of Congress and so\nThat's a that's a recipe that is probably going to produce um obviously divided government has a hard time getting things done and it's a continuing democratic anger at their opposition within the political system\nArts so there's no for example uh [noise] I'm no lessening of the divide because the Democrats let's say when the house and Republicans maintain control the Senate because there's more balance I mean\nWell ... you know that's possible and in a couple of issues interestingly trade maybe one they're actually maybe some common ground you know there are a lot of Democrats who are\nCloser to President Trump on trade and his use of tariffs and um basically challenging allies on trade issues there are some Republicans are Republicans have tended to be more free traders so you may actually have a slightly bigger\nBalance of support for the president on trade in a in a divided Congress but on most issues and particularly on health care it's going to be very hard to get something done 'em and I think you're going to have\nA an iffy if Democrats do in fact take back control of the house there's going to be inevitably pressure from the Democratic base to begin investigations of various um activities in Trump world including potentially\nA revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings of the president and the aftermath of a mall or in investigation and so you definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there is democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that\nAnd I wanted to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats with the feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of it's been it's actually more than forty depending how you count so it's a big number and you know I saw some of those ... Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can in so that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican is left\nBut by and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there's a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well financed democratic challengers a China will open seats by and large and and that again is a different situation than you would see in a more normal a midterm election year\n\nSince I was in the last four days you are listening to

potentially a revisiting the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh but also having a look at some financial dealings of the president and the aftermath of Mahler in investigation and so\nYou definitely going to have a more confrontational atmosphere in Congress or if there's democratic control of one house\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ...\nHe's written a piece about how the election is unlikely to end the political divide that we're seeing you're up to that a\n... and I wanted to ask the forty incumbent House Republicans who are vacating their seats would the feeling about a democratic wave be different if the ... the majority of those forty we're sticking around\nI think it would be I mean I think it's a big deal a you know some of that it's actually more than forty depending on how you count so it's a big number and you know some of those Republican incumbents were going to be in trouble in this environment anyway so they you know got out while the getting was good\nSome of them probably could have better defended their seats than a newcomer can and so that opens the door all the wider for Democrats is actually I think one of the unappreciated factors in in this campaign is the amount of open space Republican\nRetirements left for Democrats to move in and one of the interesting things that's happened in one of the reasons Democrats feel good about house races is that these democratic challengers in swing districts where there's an open seat or Republican is left\nBy and large well funded this time they've managed to raise a lot of money um there's a very active democratic financial support network now a lot of small donors a lot of it's on line\nAnd so you have not only democratic challengers who are facing an open seat that they have a chance to win in a swing district as well financed democratic challengers a China will open seats by and large and and that again is a different situation than you would see
