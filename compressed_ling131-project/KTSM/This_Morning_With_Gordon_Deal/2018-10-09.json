old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all of these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and and finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream I wouldn't it be great if and now finally we've learned district and we can now make enough with all the good stuff for everybody\nAnd we just

guest there or if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings as\nWorking alongside with technology\nI oh I Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go up ... fold just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education do they can

worked forty hours and we've\nIf if if our productivity goes off we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now whenever this technology\nUm I I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine the machine doing a job\nI think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who the machine a fix my road probably couldn't\nMachine teach kindergarten probably not a ... or would we want it to

that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nMake more dense systems that operate completely economists say that you could

leading the Justice Department you know while a Rosenstein was going to the White House an answering questions about\nYou know the Russia investigation going to the hill and answering questions about this trove of documents that Republicans in Congress were seeking sessions which just basically traveling\nThe country and beyond a talking about the violent crime and terrorism\nAnd as time has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually saying that it's traveling to the international cheat the issue conference in Orlando with truck a that it's something that would be very close to a session heart\nAs somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that here in France for the G ... summit which is kind of an interesting reality for both of them\nWell these are the conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nUm I think they would normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know allowing ...\nThey shouldn't cue progress as it has so I think in any other sort of environment a session to it you know prioritize immigration and violent crime and that you know drug policies will be getting credit from contributed but that's not necessarily happening at this time\nAnd I said you were speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein you said that ah there's going to be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the field after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think right now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now it's about you know whether\nTrump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to write down on their own accord so it just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all for both for all of them and the president they get into our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get a fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of keeping up eating the president and such a way that he's been able to keep her job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president is totally true rated for that little bit different\nWhen you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYet when they're together they're talking about that day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean catching is recused from that so you know he's not getting briefed he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know sessions which you know not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of\nUm you know separated him from the department that hate me at a time when it's getting involved in some of the biggest you know going to the day like immigration I guess well Rosenstein and hit the answer to a lot of the complaints from Trump and his allies session has really gotten to execute it agenda\nPete relative quiet because the focus is on ride and what he's

it says the stew of politics and gender surrounding the new Supreme Court justice have made this moment notably personal ... what have you found\nPolitics really spilled over into the workplace and so we heard a lot of different examples of people saying for example uh that that they weren't really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues\nWe have examples in this piece of people going to their bosses confided in them about ... experiences of sexual assault um once you had to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the political debates waiting to feed it to a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something\nThat really couldn't be avoided at work\nGoodness I I mean it did it caused enough friction where somebody might want to quit or they're pushing and shoving or yelling\n[noise] well we talked to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to her tone as a group of men in front\nOf her were walking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage with some people had to try to suddenly redirect conversation their tongue not engage because they just knew that they didn't want to have a heated conversation at work that\nThat that's almost like Thanksgiving dinner right ... at at work avoid religion politics things like that\nFor a long time this is Paul to cap stay out of work for a number of people to go but it's no wonder ...\nThat you you do bring it home to the office that the issues that you're you're discussing outside of work of course we're going to become a into the workplace and one person I spoke with made the point that we don't we really don't have a third place for these discussions anymore that there's home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time so of course these conversations are going to come up\nWhen you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I I've done it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is the company is called the Bateman group and they have offices in New York and San Francisco and what the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I found interesting that that particular company\nThat they set up a slacker them they'd had had to set up for the past year the flack room was called a hash tag resistance and it was a pleased for workers they're really engaged in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if it didn't want engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it about\nThat while we're speaking with chip cutter Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace I can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\nDetroit I think it's a miniature said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of wealth management

take care of him he's the one who paid your salary enough talk about politics here so some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is we can determine how they respond to want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust cry and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or wanted to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much of this boils down to gender battles\n[noise] well I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are some ... is our gender issues that but I think but we we heard on\nOn all sides of this they were men kind of come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they did not people that are just kept an eye was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really\nCross gender lines across guy economic lines it with something that this was a

if somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice was like you know do an interview or\nOr be public so what does that mean to him dear it\n[laughter] well I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not so sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw little bit there have been other times you know an an issue that he really really cares about he's not\nThat interested in doing that so you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and there are times in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some big legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with them a bit\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now with all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nFor most of them when they go through the confirmation process they have some of the doubt for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kavanaugh\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he\nFinds ways to moderate and end up for common ground with you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly\nThat that sort of makes things a little better for him\nIt's Brent that's Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall fourteen minutes now after the hour on this

some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by doctor Judith or law\nPsychiatrists and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that cat ... into their own body and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAn accident and horrific situations where they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious or depression and so it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize\nThat you're not that your heart and go out to them that it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this stress\nAnd then trying to think it has done some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion their own in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such an interesting ... standing impact and get it\nAnd on the compassion neurons go on overdrive and when you know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated but much more showing highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all like ... patients has to take news fast\nAnd not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on for a lot of stress and negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature medicate exercise Brandon laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas um triggered for instance you know if you lost your father\nAnd you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different now that that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also doing a lot to sell nurture\nYou know do something really kind of yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news now be able to meditate go outside\nUm learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then I don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd so if you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know I Know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things and the news you don't want to be around energy vampires will I write about her destroying your energy\nFor re speak with Dr Judith ... she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific\nStretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed um can the impasse who take on all the stress from other people's tragedy caused\nThemselves long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely and and have don't have the skills that I'm writing about in the book be kind of go they never want to go outside\nThey had panic disorders they can add to this is a lot of the decision because there are sensory overload all the time\nOr they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it and so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait that's going to the world I really do I feel so strongly about it is something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and it has to be having to be able to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing his he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the world\nAt JC assume radio dot com [noise]\nI'll go [noise]\nThat

different extreme leading the Justice Department you know while a Rosenstein was solely to the White House in answering questions about uh\nYou know the Russia investigation going to the hill and answering questions about you know this trove of documents that Republicans in Congress were seeking sessions which just basically traveling the country and beyond a talking about they like violent crime and terrorism\nAnd ah at titan has gone on that has become more apparent including when it is actually saying that it traveling to the international chick the cruise ship conference\nIn Orlando with ... ah\nIt's something that would be very close to a session heart as somebody who is a big fan of local law enforcement that he's in France for the G ... summit which is kind of an interesting little reality for both of them\nWell is there are conservatives are pleased with what sessions has done\nUm I think they wouldn't normally be pleased with what sessions has done but I think that a lot of Trump's allies are really sort of you know set a session like trumpet for stepping aside from the Russia investigation ads for you know just allowing Mueller's investigation to progress as\nIt has so I think in any other sort of environment a session to read you know prioritize immigration and violent crime\nAnd that you know drug policies were beginning credit from contributed but that's not necessarily happening at this time\nAnd I said you were speaking with Wall Street journal Justice Department report or CD girl and she's written a piece titled the split screen existence of Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein you said that ah there's going to be a renewed focus on immigration in the coming weeks for Mr sessions\nWell that that um actually I think that's still true uh that was a stray that was written back in may but um and that we really thought migration burst onto the field after that but I think that's still true it still\nDefinitely a high priority for session but you know I think\nRight now they're kind of just looking toward what's going to happen at the Justice Department after the midterm story right now it's about you know whether Trump is going to um you know fire either or both of them and whether they're going to write night on their own accord so it's just kind of like oh wait and see I think\nDoes seem to be a strange relationship at times\nAh all yes for both for all of them and the president they get you know our reporting has shown that Trump and Rosenstein actually get along fairly well at Rosenstein has done a pretty good job of keeping up eating the president and such a way that he's been able to keep his job\nAnd continue overseeing the Russia investigation but obviously sessions relationship with the president totally true rated for that a little bit different\nAnd you said of Mr Rosenstein and Mr sessions often talk about other things that are happening in that agency\nYeah it's I think when they're together they're talking about that day to day affairs you know what is going on they don't typically talk at length about what's going on with Russia I mean catching is recused from that so you know he's not getting for each he's not getting a you know updates about the investigation\nIt's interesting fascinating stuff what else uh jumped out at you as you were pulling all this together\nBut I just think it's interesting that you know session search you not only really damaged his relationship with Trump but just kind of\nUm you know separated him from his apartment that he lead\nAt a time when it's getting involved in some of the biggest you know going to the day like immigration I guess well Rosenstein it hit the answer to a lot of the complaints from Trump and his allies fashion has really gotten to execute it
