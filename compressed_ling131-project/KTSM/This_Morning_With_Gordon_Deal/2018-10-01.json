{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "So there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talk about these cases and the couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in his books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSo you've got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child sound say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated that probably there's fifty a cases in their starts\nOff with a case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours\nNot possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these\nAnd why did I start to accumulate that data because in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point laughing at these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search\nThirty miles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is and all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm\nProbably the first person that ever talked about it but as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary hikes\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said OK you set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away or watch the child with a child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe the plan that jerk for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and your your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare [noise]\nBut I have all these examples where these heights been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know it's incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nA yeah he's got to remove yeah we talked about a two year old boy that they\nGassed he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was sunk face down and snow the next morning unbelievably a wife and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened and it's his mom said we couldn't believe we found him and we couldn't believe it was the wife\nYou'd have occasion the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours he didn't have to go watch six miles per hour\nBut a kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody picked him up or some something or someone picked him up and left him there\n[noise] [noise] well and and the reason these cases have significant is that we'll see you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas\nAnd they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away you know I sure as probable somebody put them in the car and drove from there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness that's not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party didn't see anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody else saw anything nobody saw any cars\nNobody else was there so how did that child make that distance in that time doesn't make sense\nOr in the new book or it's law L.

presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is hinting\nAnother explanation she recently gave us the reason for her last to Donald Trump and twenty sixteen more from Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard who says her comments bring up the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private booth in a place like a school or accept this up\nIt's one of those things where to the extend it happens at all it's a threat to you know basic democracy and we have a system that works where you can't have that kind of bad kind of anecdote happen at all everybody's got a perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth\nPeople don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail it convenience factor to me does not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their honest vote ...\nMrs Clinton I I think made it sound like women or weaken powerless at times when it wants to this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want and a ... to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's protecting against by going to the ballot box\nUm and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives um I have a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular I'm making it\nMore convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote\nAnd they can go and make sure everybody gets their mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many fans you can send out to get people to the part of the ...\nUm but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote ... is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\nTurning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm In part because a lot of what that would be a democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote at church\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient showed that more convenient you can make it more likely you are to get voter turnout who are otherwise it's deterred by inconvenient\n... just a a I don't I don't think I've heard pushback on this with regards to these comments from Mrs Clinton is is just like a fairly new excuse or is this one that she's been using\nYou know to the point was Hillary has been making this excuse for why she lost and I kind of connected the dots with the vote by mail because she was not making the claim that vote by mail is responsible [noise]\nUm but I didn't connect the dots in the sense that there are any women who are being pressured to vote one way or another the only way they could possibly be actually part of it\nIs if they don't have the secrecy of the ballot box they will go to that and combine that with the growth of vote by mail and I think that there's a story there\nIs Eric Felten senior writer at

Rachel what are you hearing\nI talked to a bunch of workers on who you know expressed on you know\nFor ... Strasse leak problem you know lots of lots of issues around they're they're scheduled on worker advocacy groups are definitely pushing for that um but it you know it's unclear if these policies can really talk all of workers scheduling problem\nSo I just think I Wonder if some of them might complain they could to get robbed of overtime hours for example of something changed\nThat much is a concern but I just think that some of the laws are not really necessarily directed at\nThe end of the biggest pain point that employee that we come from talking to them on and so one thing is that a lot of workers are worried about not getting enough hours on because you're making an hourly wage so if you're not getting enough hours you might not have enough money one week for your rent or your car or food\nAnd ... do try to give workers more our some of them have stipulation that say that employers have to go to current employees and offer them more hours before hiring additional employees\nUm it's unclear if I'm at the laws are really making a big difference in terms of total number of hours for workers\nRight so who who's doing what I Know you're given McDonald's McDonald's example\nThey talk to a McDonald's franchisee in Oregon on where these laws went into effect in July\nAnd he talked about kind of how hard it's been for his store managers um a lot of extra time for paperwork she has an all come to the head office now for a multi hour session where they make their schedules together\nOn a lot of stress in terms of what do I do if a worker called out check\n'em a lot of stress around what do I do if they get to the at the end of someone shift I used to just like kind of ...\nThey would stay and they would say and I would pay them for that time but now if they stay more than a half hour over that's considered a schedule changed and I have to pay an additional fee in addition to just their hourly wage that they would be earning it was just a lot more for managers to think about\nOh we're speaking with Wall Street journal management reporter Rachel finds that just got a piece titled new laws aimed to make work hours more predictable does the uh if some of these laws go into effect it does the size of the business matter the number of employees\nYes on there really aimed at bigger businesses so it depends on the law but\nA lot of them are like over five hundred employees or you have to have a certain number of locations in the United states so we're not really talking about small businesses here\nSo the the status of some of them like you\nMentioned a New York city the whole state of Oregon\nOr does that seem to have bipartisan support or is it not gotten that far yet\n[laughter] I mean we're definitely things crop up in the areas where we tend to see more progressive legislation especially workplace legislation pop up somewhere like Seattle where they've already had a big minimum wage crush on you know area that we're we're seeing kind of knew paid sick leave laws\nOn like at New York Seattle San Francisco Emeryville, California\nUm these are definitely cropping up in and more kind of liberal outpost\nAnd then you you gave an example to of a gap that has gone through with this what I think experience maybe some growing pains but results have been favorable\nTo I mean there are a lot of companies that are just doing this of their own accord whether they see the writing on the wall that this legislation is coming whether they think it's the right thing to do for workers\nOn whether they think they're some a recruitment retention benefits for that and some companies are kind of coming out of this before the law's impact them and to back\nOn had kind of big pilot study where they implemented scheduling changes and all their stores and then try to that group that kind of went even further and they they did the positive results they saw an increase in sales and and productivity\nOn and so yes like some of the growing pains that we see from the Donald franchisee for example you know hopefully that will ease with time and they're all you know people say there will be positive benefits\n\n\nBehind

can what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to a band aid security there were really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't you have a sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the ... prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what's his name is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um\nThe servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that um all kinds of patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch to them so they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty much and then they've done that to more states more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the Internet facing system not getting at the core ... they're supposedly not connected to the in it or not getting at the voting machines at all it's not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching I'm order the election management systems and these are the system could sit in a county headquarters a there used to program the voting machines and they're also used to calculate the votes so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think that\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence or are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our election system to be hacked as a court glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the the the the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is on the back end\nA states and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and\nThey need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail on and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\n'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned it the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are not looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad while you're um that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh assistance and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any paper at all and that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cyber security journalist Nineteen Minutes after\nThe hour fortunately program was brought through my head you know not Martin begins a lottery\nThe centerpiece of your

repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg in chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use the it\nWe've got to Christ basically because who uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk letter was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in price they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we it's individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's an regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what types of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts in crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be the total year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there's several reasons for that one is that well I'm an aging country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and\nYou can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess those that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand in a crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to turn to a home equity loan to start your new business [laughter] those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do [noise]\nSure you have your ... there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley but people\nOne is to not start next Google or Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new business is being formed was actually historically quite low I I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nOr speak with ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk for a while so\nYou mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or the ... related\nI think it helps explain why would the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ... and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nHum and that some of the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like you got to bust in a recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well and some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances by about which then start to grow\nAnd if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis [laughter] but you know risque up a kind of like goes away to sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier tried to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like ... companies\nThose are being made by other companies like investment banks a private equity funds so you some sense still have risk out there it's just it forms that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\n... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the

the debate about voting by mail versus showing up in a private booth in a place like a school Eric set this up\nIt's one of those things where to the extend it happens at all it's a threat to you know basic democracy\nAnd we have a system that works where you can't have that that kind of anecdote happen at all\nEverybody's got perfect privacy when they're in the voting booth people don't have perfect privacy when they're voting by mail so why would you want to switch from the voting booth to voting by mail it convenience factor to me does not outweigh the risk of even one person being denied their honest vote and\nMrs Clinton I I think made it sound like women are weak and powerless at times when it was of this stuff\nYou know there may be some abusive or men out there who take it out on on the women in their lives if they don't vote the way they want\nAnd uh to the extent that that happens even if it's just a few instances it's protecting against by going to the ballot box um and as as for\nThe general notion that women are too weak to stand up for themselves so I think you're you're spot on that most women in our lives are have a a good sense of self centered willing to stand up for themselves to\nSpeak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard I'm Still the ballot box is not always convenient is that the argument for the mail in ballots or this is it's an effort to get more participation\n[noise] well you know it's actually been an effort in in large part to get more participation because of making it convenient but in particular I'm making it\nMore convenient for liberal voters um this has been a quest by the left to get a ... vote by mail because so much of their effort to turn on turning out the vote and they can go and make sure everybody gets\nTheir mail in ballot and take a lot of times when when there's a polling on a given day at a given polling place there's only so many fans you can send out to get people to the voting booth [noise] um but vote by mail gives you the opportunity to get more usually I'm liberal constituencies to vote\nFor him to turn out the vote a there is more important to Democrats aren't there more registered democratic voters\n... turning out the vote one way or another generally helps um democratic candidates I'm part this is because a lot of what that would be um democratic candidates rely on our get out the vote effort\nUm and there's only so much you can do when there's one voting day but if you have a month or two months of voting by mail\nI'm available you can turn out a lot more of the voters who will be discouraged to vote by inconvenient so the more convenient you can make it the more likely you are to get voters to turn out who are otherwise it deterred by inconvenient\n...
