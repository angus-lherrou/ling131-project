we're joined by Dr Schaffner infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville\nWorking with the CDC doctor what should we know\n... there's going to be a flu season that's the important thing we should all know\nMore severe less severe but it will be here who is nasty which means that now it's time to get vaccinated let's all rolled up our sleeves the recommendations are so simple we don't have to think about if you're older than six months of age yep\nYou're eligible for vaccination we should get vaccinated to protect ourselves as well as everybody around us you don't wash Britain virus this nasty virus anybody at work in in your family at home and your house of worship\nDon't the British predator get vaccinated [laughter] how difficult is the degree to correct the vaccines these days\nWhere we have lots of options there's the standard flu vaccine and for people age sixty five an older this is important because they get more serious complications there are actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them\nOne is called simply the high dose and the other has a fancy name called the ... that just means there's an immune stimulant\nPharmacies and doctors' offices most all have one for the other and that's great for people age sixty five and older and Medicare will pay for it you don't have to worry about that Mm\n[noise] um do vaccines make it more difficult to battle the flu strains\n... don't make it more difficult in fact they are the single best thing we have available\nTo combat the flu and we want to ... emphasize people age sixty five an older those younger than eight sixty five we have an underlying illness such as diabetes lung disease heart disease or immuno compromised and a special shout out\nWomen who are pregnant and backed flu vaccine is safe it protects the pregnant woman\nWomen were pregnant when they get to have a very high rate of complications and we don't want that\nAnd then there's a bonus protection they make actually passes or cross the placenta gets into the newborn baby has provides protection to the new baby after its Bork well so that's a bonus\nYeah we're speaking with Dr Bill Schaffner infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt medical center in Nashville they're working with the CDC as we head into flu season with some tips on preventing flu or any read on what these this season is going to be like who is worse than last year uh not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season the odds that or a crystal ball is cloudy and that's why we just say well let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I don't try to anticipate there is this going to be a bad one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains where those three or four vaccines are very get the one that's in your doctor's office or that pharmacists ...\nWhat about the what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what's a you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple the CDC has a take three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing and if he should get sick don't\nWait call your health care provider because they may prescribe and anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the much they get less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so

business reporter tail Francis tail what are we seeing here\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens

the idea was that they would start spending\nMoney and in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that something big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you're talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWell so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support

actually two vaccines that are licensed especially for them\nOne that's called simply the high dose and the other has a fancy name called the ... that just means lives in the new stimulant in it\nBut

this season is going to be like the worst than last year or not as bad\nBut read is that there will be a flu season the odds that or crystal ball it's cloudy and that's why we just say let's get vaccinated each and every year I don't think I don't try to anticipate there's this guy that was one just go ahead and get vaccinated that's the best protection\nThat flu vaccine will protect against\nAny number of different influenza virus strains within three or four vaccine to very get the one that's in your doctor's office or the pharmacist ...\nWhat about uh what about the spreading of germs let's say you you do get the flu what are you know how do you use yourself or use your own body to prevent it from spreading others\nYeah so it's it's very simple\nThe CDC as it takes three approach get vaccinated number to try to use hand sanitizers and hand washing frequently and avoid people are coughing and sneezing\nAnd if he should get sick don't wait call your health care provider because they may prescribe an anti viral drugs which can reduce the duration of the illness they get less likely you get complications and make it less likely you'll spread it to others so that's a
