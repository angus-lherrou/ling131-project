M.\nI thought it was am this was at the Emory I'm Carla ... yeah\nOh sorry well that's an okay no here bear with me Carla\nFinally you got something wrong [laughter] to me\nYeah I didn't hear one and then ah that's okay\nBut Capricorn you know this is I Know so many people born with Capricorn so um my mother was a January eleventh baby so uh [noise] anyone born around ... eleven January call you know it's sort of know a lot about that that vibration so one of the things\nFor Capricorn again a Saturn is there okay uh do you know anything much about astrology yourself miss wherever that yes\nOkay so ... I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime of Pluto\nMovement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that sign and Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand nine to in two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirit so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft an activity though that has deep and significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the trying which is flowing to your son so being an organizer this is what you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes we've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mystery is or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may poor Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different state um uh when I was born in a quiet city court\nThey know where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way of course in he's well I'm just\nPutting six AM here unless you give me another time I'll put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or no oh no okay no problem okay you said money\nThen where what state to live in which they deliver these in Cali right\nOkay well first of all there is an even at my website it's called global hotspots where I Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals [noise]\nWe've there's been a science for forty plus years in astrology it was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis too many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can\nAround from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California enter the union as the son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a Taurus son find tourists\nThat's an earth fine and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where you're fine and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta\nWhich is one of the four main asteroid Vesta has a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationery in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lyme into NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're ... and it's home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury retrograde times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power of Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there is a climate acts up there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh see I have a whole thing about your if which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on said no when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration and has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously are not overwhelmed the chart with a whole lot of 'em but sometimes they were very significant\nTroop of mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve or New Year's day to get predictions for two thousand Ninety two sons and my

talk about any plan B for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh speaking at the White House yesterday Trump said he has an open mind and the FBI investigation and cabinets background\nWeek or two or potentially a\nMonth to month longer and and so I mean I expect at least here at the outset at the beginning of the court's new term that maybe they won't grant a whole lot of cases until there's some clarity here for example when the courts on summer break there are all sorts of appeals to still continue to pile up until the court comes back in late September and has\nWhat's called the long conference and they go through and look at a whole bunch of requests to add new cases the docket and you can normally count on them adding you know ten twelve or so cases it leads to this year they only added a it was five and ... they're definitely baby steps right now are the court tries to to see how this is all going to shake out\nOne of the cases that will draw a lot of attention\nFor other right now there there aren't really cases are that are the same how profile his last term and we had the travel ban and [laughter] and a gay rights and political gerrymandering and we had a big case union dues\nFor now we don't have those I mean for this ... at this point in the term to you know the court is filled out its docket for about three months or had cases in will have four more to go and there's some big ones coming down the line that they could add some high profile disputes potentially later for now I mean we had a case on the endangered species act\nUm there's an important criminal law cases including you know how the double jeopardy clause\nBut as far as people from being prosecuted twice for the same crime how that should work when you have both a shadow government in the state government looking to do the charges when there are a lot of important cases but ... but nothing that rises to the level of the public visibility of that sort of cases we saw at the end though after\nSpeaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent can those pieces called Supreme Court opens new term without ninth justice in place or what is the case of the most hunter that is the Supreme Court\nMore interesting cases have I mean it's not you know again super high profile dispute but I mean one of the things that makes it particularly interesting is the most honorable have now been to the court twice [laughter] uh you know in the courtroom I hear about one percent of the cases that attack to here and\nAnd for most people if the court you know if they get their case to the court I mean it's like hitting the jackpot and and and to the hunter has done it twice [laughter] um\nThis is a man and Alaska who who's ... bird hunting ground he he gets there and I have a craft beer to cover a body of water to this nature preserve and there's a dispute about whether has however Kraft is actually allowed to use this body of water under federal regulations that however Kraft is not supposed to be on it [noise]\nUm if state regulations government he can be he's ... he's been in the court for several several years I'm trying to get to sort it out and there was not a a conclusive resolution when when he was here a couple of years ago so after a lower court ruled against him a second time\nHe came back and said hey can you can you hear my case again and rule on this one for all in the court said yes and so his case is one of the ones that we have a pending here for the fall\nAnd just to be clear ... because the court right now is operating with just eight justices a new justice could join at any time right just because the court just because the term is underway doesn't really mean anything\nThat's right I mean all I mean is it the court is now operating in and conducting business shorthand it\nWhen it's Brent Brent Kendall Supreme Court correspondent for the wall Street Journal\nInvestors like the sounds of the north American\nTrade pact

giant floating trash collectors and try to scoop it up it's a daunting task to do the patch includes about one point eight trillion pieces of trash\nAnd ways to eighty eight thousand tons the equivalent of five hundred jumbo jets and while many scientists say it's great that people are trying to clean up the patch others say most of our efforts should instead go towards stopping the out of control flow of plastic garbage into the ocean\nIt's a story by ... writes science writer at USA Today toil tell us about the patch\nIt's about like the solid mass it's about like eh it's not like a thing you can necessarily see from an airplane or from space because a lot of it is just under the surface and it's also a lot of little\nA lot of it it's broken down at a rather small pieces so uh when you think of it it's not like you can't walk on edge and you can't like a you know it's it's not this blob of something that's like a solid by any stretch it kind of spread out over an area about twice the size of Texas\nGoodness gracious to do um currents play a role in sort of keeping it all together as in weather patterns things like that\nIt's mainly ocean currents that's the main thing that keeps the thing's going or a ... they're called jai ours is just the scientific term and that's just a kind of a circular pattern swirling around the ocean and it it eventually it's kinda like in a bath tub it circles around and around there all the stuff kind of collects in one area\nAnd that's what's happening here that that it's a a ... that's kind of goes around much of that part of the Pacific just ends up circling together and did this one bass and as I said there's other jai hours in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic ocean and so this is this is one of several around the world well\nWho's responsible for ... for all this mess\nAnd yeah it's all humans it's a you know there was obviously no plastic before the fifties the Nineteen fifties and so basically it's just a uh it's just all of us around the world men dumping plastic not disposing of properly allowing it to just flow out into the ocean\nI'm this particular patch or I mean it's probably mainly from Asia or they they they they seem to think that most of the ocean trashes from China Indonesia\nThe Philippines a and that's that's kind of been the source for a lot of it the U.S is is somewhat of a contributor I it's not we're not completely blameless but we are over all doing a better job than some of the some of the developing countries around the world so\nThat that is that wind up in there if it's if let's say that China is to blame for a good chunk of this are they actually dumping it in the ocean or they can't process what they have were being sent\nWell yea for quite a while they were happily accepting garbage or plastic garbage from around the world you know 'cause other countries didn't know what to do with it and so we are other countries would ship it to China and that that was something that was well no we would ship that mark garbage or plastic\nAnd for whatever reason we didn't no one really seemed to you'll see no evil well you know it's we've shifted there we didn't really know what they did with it well you know could very well be they were just dumping into the ocean\nUh we we don't know because we don't really ... track that but they have actually China has stopped accepting trash um other parts of the world as over the last couple of years so that that will no longer be a a dumping ground for this plastic\nUh so where where other countries are going to have to figure out what to do with it a rather than just dumping China\nWe're speaking with Doyle rice science reporter at USA Today has ... where did the trash in the great Pacific garbage patch come from\nAnd how do we stop it you quote somebody in the stories that are ... there were these wonderful cleanup efforts going on a but that's a waste of time largely we need to spend more time figuring out how to keep this up out of the ocean\nJust mentioning that are either this is a pig to the\nTo the ocean cleanup project which is a very noble and nobody nobody saying you know necessarily that it's not a good thing but ah that ah it's this project developed by a another one's company a very young guy started about a few years ago he was Eighteen at the time\nAnd it's the ocean cleanup project and he's invented this kind of this large scooping mechanism uh that uh he\nSome of his colleagues there believe will uh\nWill actually be able to soak up for school up a lot of this trash and
