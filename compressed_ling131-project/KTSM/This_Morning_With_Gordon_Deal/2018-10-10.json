Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the fastest anything a travel and yet here we have an instantaneous connection between the articles\nThat there are things in the ... fabric of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't see them in our everyday lives\nHas this changed your life\nIt absolutely has I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly this it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced the notion of interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on that brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which\nIf we're all connected than helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that this has implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to world peace\nOr I my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book and into upside down thinking\nThat you're George my website is mark Goldberg dot com and they are K G.

different guest host and musical acts each week the opening sketch of each show ends with one actor saying live from New York and Saturday Night\nThat's your look back at this week in history you\nCan increase in the voting ranks of women and minorities groups that tend to lean democratic\nMuch of that increase is the result of a change to driver's license forms and acted two years ago in which new applicants and renewables are automatically registered to vote unless they expressly opt out more from Wall Street Journal reporter Cameron McWhorter in Atlanta Campbell is going on\nFor a very strange thing because\nRepublicans as a rule don't like these motor voter bills which are bills which\nIs what's your past and several states which allow people when they go to register or re read or renew their driver's license they automatically get registered to vote unless they opt out or say purposely chose to opt out and so what it's done in those states as well to\nA lot more registration and it's been fought by a lot of Republicans who consider it a a a way to that that could be misused this you know where people who have driver's licenses but aren't necessarily said as soon as\nSomehow end up voting at a could cause problems so that has been the case in Georgia but about two years ago\nOr the department of drivers services here\nJust made this little change in the document on the advice of their attorney general and I can't get a real straight answer as to why they did it and but what it did was it basically created a motor voter situation in Georgia without passing a bill and so the result is\nThe scene registrations go through the roof here we're more than any a\nA voter Dr efforts by democratic leaning groups are I mean registrations are way up among all groups African Americans or Asians Hispanics white people to a lesser extent I mean it's really brought out a lot of new voters\nAnd the Republican governors signed off on it right\n[laughter] right and again that everyone gets very skittish where I started closely as to why they did that but the uh the Democrats and meanwhile the Democrats are\nAre somewhat skittish about it because they want to talk about voter suppression that's one of their talking points and the truth of the matter is if you look at the wrong numbers of people who are\nOf the possibility of voting and Georgia it's increased dramatically in Kabul digits way higher than the population has increased in the last two years\nSo as one observer or expert in your story said just because there's an increase in registration for a particular group that does not equal turn out all the time\nOr exactly so but now the battle becomes turnout so talking to various experts that I spoke to regarding\nThese bill they say look let's let's just promote hurdle so we'd have more people registered to vote so they're allowed to vote now it's up to the parties which should be to engage voters and get them to the polls so and\nThat's certainly what both parties here are doing ah regarding the governor's race and torture which is which very intense and all the polls indicate extremely close\nMm I'm speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Cameron McWhorter about his piece entitled Georgia's motor voter Dr boosts eligible voters in groups leaning democratic I saw the tightest together now because we have this very closely watched in what appears to be highly intense battle for the governorship in Georgia\n[noise] right so Stacey Abrams is an African American woman running on the Democratic ticket she is the ah she would be the first African American woman to ever become an issue in any anywhere in United States where she to win\nA you Brian Kemp who is a stalwart Republican the secretary of state or who is I'm just trying to keep up a a dominant Republican dominance of the governorship in Georgia and try to carry on the legacy of previous governors like Nathan Deal who is now leading\nWho's very pro business but also very conservative and anyway and so these two candidates are really clashing they are ready to both raising tons of money in and out of state\nThey are both uh a hammering each other whenever possible [laughter]\nAnd they are bowl I'm scrambling to get voters to the polls the this will play and you know if Stacey Abrams can bring a for example more African American voters to the polls which according to primary she did do that in the in the in the Democratic primary if those people show up\nAnd enough numbers and Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans who are um who tend to lean democratic come to the polls are the Republicans could have a real tough time and ah they they were very aware of that I mean there\nThere's all kinds of things including trying to get um

that matter to you you are listening to America's first knew this morning with Gordon the\nLead you with us we'll come into Wednesday there are competing advertisements\nRepresenting an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president as an avid watcher of Fox News and particular and we know that because he is frequently tweeting in real time as he watches particularly Fox and friends in the morning and then also um\nDuring Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs them over at the Fox business channel\nUntil the general public's notice and still have lobbyists MTC [laughter] and\nLobbyist have found that a ineffective way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV program so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild looks like a fern what example whose airing what\nWill we took a look at the story now because there's a big fight that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also opposes that are sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nAs you know to be influenced by them\nWhat we can see is that he can sing age sometimes directly after\nAn ad that pops up on TALK on\nThis happened to win a group of a U.S steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up and the president started talking about the issued suggesting that he had seen the ad [laughter] um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last year billionaire Tom tire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noticed that and tweeted about it right away\nFrom speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you meant to do that ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong viewership um during this administration the viewership has a raise and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some ... from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that a strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president\nHas expressed dislike for programs on\nOn those two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him\nWell that ah that that sounds\nI guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin Mac from that group

Charlie if you remember fourteen years ago Charlie a random like a barn saw through a southwest in central Florida as a category four\nSo unfortunately the this was going to try the massive storm surge possibly nine to Thirteen feet above ground level I mean can you imagine nine to Thirteen feet of water outside your front door or so you know really if anybody's\nStill along the Florida a Gulf Coast they only of hours left to get away if they if they've been ordered to it in an evacuation\nMy goodness we're speaking live this morning with Weather Channel senior digital meteorologist Jonathan burden the are are are are there were the comparisons to Florence which struck the Carolinas last month\nWell you know it's interesting Gordon because actually this is probably do some of her as you possibly get to foreigners in one of the ...\nThe differences of course the intensity or looking at a category for landfall as opposed to Florence spinning down to a category one and if you remember what it once was agonizing slow crawl through her line is\nThat produce the you know the feet of rain and the ethics flooding that occurred for weeks afterwards or what we're seeing what Michael is again it's much more intense\nAnd it's going to accelerate fairly rapidly through a southwest in central Oregon and end of the Carolinas\nA Thursday on Thursday night and really by this time friday morning it'll be off the east coast in and out of the way so it's moving the good news is moving quickly but it get it to the ferociously attempt storm a unfortunately for the Gulf Coast\nIt seems so a bizarre is the kind of the historical perspective you gave before about this type of storm not hitting the Florida Panhandle in so long or ever but I like listen I'm up in New Jersey so I think Gulf of Mexico I think hurricanes big storms ... why I guess not those area\n[noise] yeah you would think so I mean I I'm I'm looking right now at a map of all the historical category for hurricane tracks the Gulf of Mexico\nAnd you know there there's been a number of them that have hit the Alabama\nGulf Coast the Mississippi Gulf Coast Louisiana and Texas and South Florida but there's just this strange gap a from a north of Tampa or through say Appalachian coal and Panama City\nThat has not seen it has not seen a category for landfall and it's sometimes it's just the steering wheel into the atmosphere that when you get the really intense hurricanes like this\nThey tend to go further south and then further west in the western Gulf of Mexico and not so much hitting the Florida Panhandle Gulf of Mexico or so since it's October the steering which tend to steer it more towards Florida than toward the west or do\nSomething very good hey thanks for sharing a few minutes was always on these uh importantly critical days that's meteorologists Jonathan urban from the weather channel with us live this morning it's twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nLook into any great business whether it's a manufacturing\nOr a hotel a store\nLook into each and every one of them and you'll find the same thing great\nPeople grown us we believe that great businesses are powered by great people and with criminals workforce solutions we'll help you find them gates and engage them learn more criminals dot com crash into the workforce innovation works [noise]", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "El Paso", "day": "10"}
