Nevada senator Dean Heller Mr Heller never endorsed President Trump's twenty sixteen campaign but his Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein says then Trump Arab political facts of life intervened read what do we have\nWell Dean Heller in twenty six teams that he was Ninety nine percent against Trump a he has been a sort of moderate senator about Republican senator from a swing state uh and was\nKept his distance during the campaign and then even during the first several months of the president's administration Dean Heller of stayed away from Trump he opposed to it at a press conference in Las Vegas a in June of twenty Seventeen and said he could not support the Republican health care overhaul\nA in shortly after that a guy he got a primary challenger and his his political uh outlook turned it became a big Trump supporter big supporter of the president's a judicial nominees uh and then\nWe saw this weekend in at a rally in Nevada he compared the president can lightest and said everything he touches turns to gold\nShe's right so the primary challenger was from Tarkanian correct\nAs from Danny Tarkanian ah the son of the famous basketball code right number Jerry Tarkanian coach the ah the run rebels you at all the uh his son Danny as a\nSomething of a perennial candidate and the Vatican's runs seven times and and without winning for different officers but he has a base of support in the conservative wing of the Republican Party and he lost the Senate campaign a primary against getting our last summer with the idea that senator Heller walking loyal enough to the president of the president's policies\nAre in almost instantly within a few days we saw Dean Heller react to it by a revealing for the first time that he voted for the president and twenty sixteen

they are a flag around and the wind\nThat they are essentially suggesting that our drift in the wind and that he uh has changed his mind on a number of policies that most ... most critical health care to suit President Trump and his supporters are and that senator Heller\nJackie rose now that can't be counted on to make decisions in the vestiges of Nevada but that that's so odd to please President

background\nI mean a lot of times the the G O P the Republicans are the ones who are sort of aligned themselves with the party of a that's a pretty uh flagging country of patriotism but there's a both ah both an up and coming crop of recently elected congressional veterans who are sort of shutting the framework to to bring other vets\nIn and then there's a few dozen veterans running on the on the Democratic side or the vets\nAre seemingly willing to do this\nSo this has been a who's been sort of a two fold every one is um folks in the Democratic party upset that veterans have been a habit of coaching a party say you were interested in running a and shape time\nThe Democratic party has a has a number of different things are putting in place to to welcome back in the party so for instance there's a couple a couple of first term a first term Democrat actually in the house representatives to have\nWorked together fundraising apparatus take a leadership role in the party and uh have have really come out to support so veterans who are coming up behind them and the system\nIs that right is that number correct that there is a hundred and Ninety nine veterans I guess of of all parties who are actually congressional candidates\n[laughter] that's right so that's a\nRepublican Democrat independent and any other any other stripe [noise] I'm a a a bipartisan superPAC who support support for veterans running for Congress to pledge to sort of have\nA to have campaigns that rise above the box you know they don't they don't want to engage in in in the mud slinging and a and a negative campaigning this group called wick on earth tracking that ah there's nearly two hundred veteran from from both parties and independent to ... as well as a\nNew new candidates is all incumbents running so there's a lot of veterans that are out there for this mid term a midterm Caesar's\nWow we're speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Ben ... he covers veterans issues he's written a piece about how Democrats are trying to win with help from military veteran candidates\nUm there was one analyst directs birder observer in your story you said a military service doesn't necessarily translate to the best candidate for office which seems obvious but what was the point they're\nWill but the point there is that ah\nWith any military veteran when you're running sometimes the the iconography of uh of learning as a patriot the background and experience of being in the military or can can can issue warn people wanting to be in one trick pony so that the military service\nCan become the some of their fellow parts and right now that that's a strategy that that some folks are using if they're if they are veterans themselves and they're running against actress to say hey look yeah well you know like\nWe we appreciate we appreciate the service but you know there's there's other ...\nAnd in this very partisan environment a rise election cycle [noise] um there there are there are observers who are saying but you know the end of the day you need to have the best fit for the best for the congressional district and\nHow close are they going to are they going to shoot at a party line and in some ways that can come back and hurtful pledging to be independent voices\nYou know maybe they don't have to they don't have the the bona fides that are needed to say they're going to\nWork with work with their particular party in a year when voters oftentimes are are looking for people to align with them politically it's rather do vote for him\nYeah I Know was anecdotal but I think there was one woman in your story you said that was a while she was choosing a particular veteran because he seemed willing to compromise with the other party\nWell the the the one woman I spoke with that I think illustrates all you know talking to a number of different people said hey I'm really I don't like the partisanship that that that's happening in the country\nI don't like the direction we've gone I Wish people would talk across the aisle but at the end of the day I Want to make sure my party when so there there there are a lot of voters that I've that I've spoken with to have that\nHave that um have that opinion you know I wouldn't want people to work together and yet I still want my party to win because I think my party is the one that's going to work with the other party\nThat's going to
