{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "The pay for that minute published last week is on his website we're going to be discussing this uh tonight on the show\nLike on my news website over a coast to coast able to take history there there are elusive papers on the right hand side\nThe current neighbor is the one that is on the town now with your analysis here minute it gets a little complicated a little technical\nBut the idea behind it is actually quite simple in an allegation which is is that some of the layers have a different thickness in stone and take us through bad\nYeah um when when you when you're standing in front of the pyramid and you look up the walls are you when you stand close you don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view\nYou start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and um ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper ah he calls his waves and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by fitness petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner bought\nEvery once in a while there is a jump so you have a much thicker course and then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in thickness and just keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri\nNoted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base\nSome of these peaks have rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty fifth ... so he found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these ... courses and that was it uh it was not for the interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and ... and the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred and\nAh originally\nTwo hundred and ten originally is there and I have\nTo have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the pyramid\nWas not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... father John ... vow and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall ths or\nAcademia a page and it's also in costs me gloom uh his brother vote to attend and he sees in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not\nComing to a peek a and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the sticker layers\nUm\nIs it every ten steps is a ... there's some kind of ... you\nI that's a great question I I that was the first thing also I was looking for it but unfortunately I unfortunately no it's not that easy it's it's kind of you know Jimmy it's kind of haphazard has to be honest with you I I'm I was just struck by when I first saw that I was just struck why did they do this\nUm because you know you were you just you know simple in mind that I thought each step they would just\nUh applied the uh the pyramid and go you know in Egypt and the Egyptians design your your image with something called they called ... which is the pyramid and go and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount Ford\nAnd that's how the conceptual eyes of German angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up a staircase each step is the same and and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd to your question again there's little regularity even to the thickness so when you know it's it's completely off hazardous but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are a\nCouple of dozen that are decker\nYeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it still ended up at the right angle on all four sides yeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors but that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in a state to block interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing uh during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't a case in the paper\nIt was a star trek\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation big dinner was so important to chip shows that the authors propose that therefore they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the paper\nAnd we why the pyramid ended up in the in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there this is coast to coast and we've got to take a break my new this is ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise]\nGood Daily Show updates right during box for free zones newsletter sign up to the ... am dot com\nBoom
