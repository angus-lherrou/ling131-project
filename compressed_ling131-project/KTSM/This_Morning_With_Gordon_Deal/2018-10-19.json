Newman this piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um\nHow easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly that are there any sanctions on us we are going to respond with what they said the words were greater action\nAnd you know I think they're clearly referring to oil prices so they hatch people it within Saudi Arabia sugar speaking on behalf of the ruling family they're saying you know we can do prices

wants to hold on to the house if it's the last thing he does the retiring house speaker is hitting the trail for an aggressive final stretch of campaigning in an attempt to help more than two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza Collins got the scoop it was what do we know\nHe had that really aggressive shine offspring he's like he's going to Trump state he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbent who currently certainly can I can fall are\nOn incoming aries helping their incoming Republican candidate specifically like the person trying to catch the because he's retiring\nWould keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nWell he always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read a lot of money for the party keeps raids that were seven eight million dollars I'm\nNot for the party with a lot of that going to keep each candidate\nSafer to kick the can it can be threatened by the way he's not running again and keep an aggressive schedule but it is new for him to be hammering sort of well you know basically like a day to day a multiple ... and\nIt just go kind of on a sign of spent that we should remember he's retiring\nAnd it would really help they'd like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves like\nGeez I so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his side\nYeah this is really interesting as well I spent on the last couple of years having the Freedom Caucus and could after they'd been turning his head either that or truck conservative fire raid members of his party who will threaten or in some cases\nHave actually send legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough um Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order to pass anything and they can do right now on their own um\nBut they need to buy in from the frame ... because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they started voting bloc and they've done and they've threatened to do that\nAnd so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat who is sort of one of the leaders of the freedom I said not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races so\nWe're speaking with allies that Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates that what kind of messaging will he have does or does it change from Canada to candidate\nSo it works from candidate a candidate what how do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership on\nThe economy there talking about opioid station which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package that was signed into law under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny tiny little bells all grouped together a lot\nOf vulnerable Republicans had their names on those bells and painting and all of that but the message basically being you're better off Republican leadership and Democrats\n... they are going further and further than\nA how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going into these are really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere\nRent payments that none of them are counted out by these districts where the Democrat is and they can't take strong place it's probably not\nJust tricks to align yourself really closely with the president in last year doing an event with just the Republican base but right sort of more of a moderating force he obviously the vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney and\nSo he can then he doesn't illicit really strong feelings from either side of people might not like his agenda that he's not as controversial as President Trump so that they're hoping he'll go in and kind of be able to defend the Republican Party image and actually stay on message about the economy and that sort of thing\nThere's a lot of

I I think that the timing would actually work\nUh you know he can say look we're we're going to do a thorough investigation make sure we really know what happened then that could easily take you another four weeks or so so that this will whatever happens comes after the elections in which ... which point he has a little more freedom\nAnd then you have to say well what would what what kind of sanctions would be\nA I don't think we've ever actually put limits not in not in the last thirty or forty years anyway we've never sort of put an embargo on um Saudi oil coming to the United states I think it's hard to imagine that happening\nWhat the United States has done with regard to human rights abuses in other countries is they have sanctioned particular companies you say you could make it hard for that companies do business to do business and that's where you say well they can't uh we don't want them doing business with us financial\nInstitutions that that can um you know really cause some pain and then there's this other thing called the Magnitsky Act which was originally passed by Congress\nAh with regard to Russia but that can be used with other countries as well not allow the U.S government to put sanctions on individual so you can say\nA certain name individuals are not permitted to do business with us financial institutions anywhere and that uh you can see their assets in the United states if they have any and do some other things that are they the government here is use that against some Russians\nAre and it's pretty effective it makes life very complicated for the targeted people\nAnd we're speaking with Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman this piece is called why Trump is going soft on Saudi Arabia and he points to reasons like Iran and oil um how easy would it be by the way a for Saudi Arabia to tinker with the price of oil\nI think it would be very easy and I think that's the problem so the Saudis have said very clearly didn't that are there any sanctions on us we are going to respond with what they said that words were greater action and you know I think they're clearly referring to oil prices so they hatch people\nIt within Saudi Arabia share speaking on behalf of the ruling family they're saying you know we could all crisis right now west Texas crude is around Seventy dollars\nAre they are saying we could easily just restrict supply and prices go up to eighty dollars a hundred dollars um you know the Saudis are still the biggest oil producer in the world and they could\nOr they could easily restrict supply enough to push oil prices almost as high as they want to so would they do that um I you know I\n... it's hard it is really kind of head scratching because it's a little bit hard to see this outbreak of sort of oil or petroleum warfare do ah when all these countries really do need each other I mean ... the shot Saudi Arabia I mean the United states\nUh United States does me Saudi oil even though we produce a lot more of our own oil we use to show that you know as we've seen as so many times that so many different ways\nI mean the middle Middle Eastern politics it's so complicated ah in in large part because of who sells oil and enjoy all\nThanks records Yahoo Finance columnist ...
