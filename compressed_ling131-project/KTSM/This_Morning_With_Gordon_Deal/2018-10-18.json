these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Allen aren't they scammers\nYes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this year's company but there are a million of them and this sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking

think right uh and\nFirst of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is known to give other than\nHelping us fight for each are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with their third party collection companies\nI'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education at this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education [noise]\nSo I mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent\nOf the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with a question of you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Ellen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this republic clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government so so the information they have is good [noise]\nUm but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt you never heard from them again well you\nHave to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this

be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent typically for order loans is

said in your story too is the older homes right ones that are decades old fifty years plus maybe that took the the worst of the beating\nThat's what the locals were telling us is that you know the

by bank rate dot com the top reason Americans are cutting back each month is there need to save more money but for what purpose analysis from Greg McBride chief financial analyst that bank right right what are some findings\nAbout two thirds of Americans are limiting their spending job for very reasons but the fact that two thirds are holding back in what is otherwise a pretty good economy is notable this is the highest it's been four years um you know in the middle of the range that we've seen over the years\nUm but what did the reverse the trend where you see where\nThe economy got better and better each successive here we saw that people are a little bit looser with the purse strings and that changed the share it jumped from sixty percent now to sixty six percent that say that they are actively limiting how much they spend every month reversing that downward trend that we had seen a in several years prior to that\nYou represented in the ... remarks there but this was a solid economy right to wages are creeping up the the tax cuts for more money in Americans paychecks with why this trend now\nYou know it's interesting you mentioned the growth of household income and I did that is one thing that we have seen consistently show up at the last few years that was initially a well we sort of look at it this show five or five years or so ago\nThat was the topic of the people limited they're spending it was the cause their incomes weren't going up we noticed over the past several years though is that as\nA income growth became more broad based\nThat became less and less the case where that was the reason people were holding back and instead people were saying well Modi back in order to save more money that continues to be the predominant reason and buy a pretty wide margin a couple of other things that that they're watching the percentage of Americans\nTo point to too much debt as to why they're holding back\nThat's been creeping higher each of the past few years down the highest that it's been at any any point that we've looked at this over the last five years and I think that's consistent with a rising interest rate environment that better economy we are seeing debt burdens come up but that the higher debt burdens toppled with rising interest rates\nAre they get shows that there are some people out there are starting to feel the squeeze on interest rates and then we even an assault economy there there there are still those that are you\nEver present worries about the economy there are still ... percent of people say that the reason they're holding back as soon as the you know worried about the economy began not a whole lot different from what we've been seeing last year a lower than in years past but not a whole lot different than last year but again I think even shows that even on a sunny day somebody's worried about right\nNow and we're speaking with Greg McBride chief financial analyst at bank great dot com and got a new survey that indicates sixty six percent of Americans are limiting spending about by generation what's that break down\nYou know it's interesting guy the tendency to both back on spending and inclination to save more as the reason falling back\nSkew younger so millennials in particular lead the way they are the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spend ... also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on my spending Gen x is not far behind um but it's so similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to say more money\nBut that's changing ... baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back on their spending as their younger counterparts [laughter] but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth and the economy's doing well\nI think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers that are in the workforce stagnant income is still very much an issue\nAnd much of this is a recession hang over that may have been passed on from parents who went through it\nTo say oh what a\nGeneration Z or the millennials or whatever some of these young adults just picking this up on their own\nSo certainly with millennials I we've seen this this is no fluke I mean we've seen this in a number of different surveys that we've done over the years you know some of the things that you and I talked about\nIn the past ... millennials have a greater inclination\nToward saving they have a little less of a consumption focus and they're more averse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations and I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of voter millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings are just as you were sort of in those financially formative years\nHas undoubtedly had in the fact that we see that manifesting itself in a number of different

Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nWith our tuition and direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care it and some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah maybe there's some of the state that did not go along with the ... expansion of Medicaid and its time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut as you're trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expanded Medicaid to people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's been some pushback from state officials and some of the state\nAnd one of the interesting thing that's going on at that are gambling Utah their ballot initiative include the way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government paid her most of the costs of the state does have some portion of the ...\nName which was the first state to do this to ... to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe government has three she has to go along in part because the funding issue in Utah now they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock\nBy including a finding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative trial\nSo how similar are the initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\n[noise] ... the main tribes as saying that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people to earn enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um\nThis is an issue one week and it's still um ... and as an issue and said that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us and we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know for us\nThe country [laughter] one argument for why that had happened by mail initiative is there any they're conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting they for CARE Act but if their voters say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\n[laughter] we're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece entitled midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially they're Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on health care issues for a number of years on on a hill and he said a foreign with healthcare reporters that he thinks if these initiatives these ballot initiatives in these states passed that it it could have started trend for the rest of the state that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the only thing that's going on\nIs some states that haven't expanded Medicaid interpreted states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that advocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play\nSome states might be willing to expand Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky [noise]\nOkay yeah I went to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or to have an effect on this right\nRight that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact on the ballot initiative because governors aren't the only ones in their states that have to say in it they're just in the state legislatures are due to but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money ... would there be guaranteed that would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the argument that uh opponent of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guaranteed that they said that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their their argument is that it states get depended on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion than states you're going to be on their own\n...

the way they\nAre the most likely of all the generations to really be limiting how much they spent hand are also the most likely to say I need to save more money and that's why I'm holding back on spending Gen x is not far behind um similar trend there\nMost inclined to be limiting their spending because they want to save more money\nBut that's where it changes a baby boomers those are the sandwich generation a couple of things one they're not as likely to be holding back on their spending as their younger counterparts but when they do their reasons are different and it but the predominant reason is stagnant income so even though we're seeing broad based income growth it on the economy's doing well\nI think that's another indicator that you're particularly for baby boomers

little less of a consumption focus and they're more verse to debt than what we have seen from preceding generations\nAnd I think a lot of it stems from having had a front row seat for the financial crisis either experiencing it first hand in the case of voter millennials or\nSeen the impact that it had on family members friends older siblings I'm just as you were sort of in those financially
