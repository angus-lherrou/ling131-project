the majority is the ability of committee chairman to issue subpoenas\nHouse Judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte and oversight committee chairman Trey Gowdy are moving as fast as they can knowing the Democrats stand a good chance of taking the house in the mid term elections what happens if Adam Schiff\nBecomes chairman of house intelligence Elijah Cummings takes oversight and Gerald ... Holmes the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI and the Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election\nThese are investigations that have been going on for a while but now all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of four chance of losing the ... the uh the house\nA majority this year and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation\nIs it's up to the chairman of the house committee to issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own um say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee needs the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue a subpoena so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWhile still the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\nOf the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee\nI'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like with the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power in Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house said they'll probe if they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of death and Noone as you'll have it being run by Adam shifts and he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and you'll have over in the house oversight committee um electric Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd Gerald Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a shift has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election um those will disappear from the house side\nWhat Republicans hold the house then what happens\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a a new energy that will come from having been racing to get 'em witnesses the for the committee's [laughter] you know the things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady

during off year elections with a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set this up\nWell so for Democrats to win control the Senate and that the Republicans have only\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep those seats and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bell weather states that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin I'll want her to oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because uh she Claire McCaskill kind of an institution Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the ballot should be deeply important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have a Bill Nelson a Denmark another democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big time match between two heavyweights very leery\nA a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott because he's seen as a leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him as people think the rescue effort hasn't been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold on to that when if they're going to have a chance and third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake a Republican retiring ... Arizona is kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way uh in any election\nUh and you have to ... you have two women from Congress Martha Mick Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the Democratic side in a year of the woman going at it uh well Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnchors the cinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if there were cuts are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote a total one of those probably going to have the Arizona so those seem like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how\nThis adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... he's\nBeen an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a cabinet in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's a great question I it's hard to know is is um he's going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large voted suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities [laughter] those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in a midterm election compared to their performance at a presidential election so [laughter]\nUh you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but in a to Z as in three weeks before the election and actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhen Jerry it's Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas purse news [noise]\nNothing small and not your ... your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nTheir partnership even bigger\nRebels technology advisors you'll get the ... and one on one partnership to help your business ground because we're the reliable down these ... you can focus on what matters now getting done\nTo kind of learned as a parent\nThere are no perfect answer do you have to be perfect to be a perfect parents part of the teams in foster care will not even on the phone\nFor more information on how you could have gone to dump us kids dot org a public service announcement from the U.S department of health and Human Services adopt us kids and the ad council that the right time\nYou buy them different doctor managing him or more chronic conditions like high blood pressure arthritis or diabetes\nBut he doesn't have to be [noise]\nManagement services can help you get to connect to kill you need\nThe dots between your medical appointments honesty in hospital [noise]\nYour doctor will work with the green\nChicken with your between the\nYou with your house you can spend more time dealing with Iraq [noise] if you have Medicare document panic can management services\nConnecting you need some more information Medicare dash got in there for chronic heritage you paid for by the U.S talking to him [noise]\nTop ... dot org a public service announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\n[noise]\nListening to America's this morning\nWith us now is one of\nThe hour on this morning Jennifer ... is back with more of America First\nWhat President Trump says he wants to know what happened in the death of Saudi journalist Jamal cat show the but also boy stay protective view of the U.

powers that comes with the majority is the ability of committee chairman to issue subpoenas\nHouse Judiciary committee chairman Bob Goodlatte and oversight committee chairman Trey Gowdy are moving as fast as they can knowing the Democrats stand a good chance of taking the house in the mid term elections what happens if Adam Schiff\nBecomes chairman of house intelligence Elijah Cummings takes oversight and Gerald Nadler Helms the house Judiciary Committee here's Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard Eric what's up here\nRight now we've got a whole crush of people being called before congressional committees to testify about the FBI indio Jay's actions before the two thousand sixteen election these are investigation that have been going on for a while but\nNow all of a sudden there's a time pressure on getting people to come in and testify\nBefore those committees and it all comes down to the mid term elections which is there's an expectation that probably you know Republicans have a three out of for a chance of losing this should be ah the house\nA majority this year and what they lose if they lose a majority of the crucial thing an investigation\nIs it's up to the chairman of the house committee issue subpoenas sort of on his or her own um say so and so you you meet the subpoena power to force people to come in and talk\nTo give testimony and in the Senate the chairman of a Senate committee meets the agreement of the ranking member of the other party to issue a subpoena so you don't have the same kind of power and so even if the Republicans hold on to the\nSenate if they lose the house they really lose that power to force people to come in to testify\nWhile still the current let's say investigations could they be shut down if Democrats take control or or the do the investigations have to see the way to the end\n[noise] um the congressional investigations can turn on a dime I mean\nThey can be going along and be one day from coming out with their report conclusions and if the party changes than the power over what the majority puts out as a report changes immediately and show\n'em power of having a congressional um leadership both in the big picture and in each individual committee I'm really determines what that committee does it's it's not like\nWith the inspector general's investigation which is going on he will keep going with his investigation regardless of who's in power and Congress\nOr speak with Eric Felten senior writer at the Weekly Standard he's written a piece titled how the midterms will affect Congress's investigations are what are the Democrats in the house say they'll probe shifts they gained the majority after November\nWell you know you've got in the house intelligence committee instead of death and Noone as you'll have it being run by Adam Schiff said he's made it very clear that he will be\nI'm pursuing allegations of money laundering from the Trump Organization so that's what his focus will be and uh you'll have over in the house oversight committee um electric Cummings will be in charge there\nAnd that Gerald Nadler will take over the house Judiciary Committee those are the three committees that have been primarily looking at a investigations a chef has made it clear that um\nIs money laundering investigation that he wants to launch we'll be focused specifically on Donald Trump and Russia so you can be pretty sure that on the house side that any investigation into abuses by the FBI and the\nApartment of justice I'm with regard to investigating the Trump campaign during the two thousand sixteen election\nUm those will disappear from the house side\nWhat if Republicans hold the house then what happens [noise]\nUm then things keep going on and what will happen is the investigations I think will not only\nHave kind of new life but they'll have a new energy that will come from having been racing to get um the witnesses before the committee's [laughter] you know that things had been moving along\nAt a store to steady pace with everything else going on in the house and so all of a sudden they have a lot more time at their disposal but they've done a bunch of\n'em

they're obviously\nWay too many of them but they're still rare I mean it is unlikely that the school will be a\nTarget it but it's a state law to practice and so they do and they take it very seriously and um [noise] you know it's it's it's a lot of work when you have students who have severe autism Down syndrome other behavioral challenges some of them are\nA seizure disorders or medical issues and um they they work hard\nTo to to do what they need to do\nA lot of these students have one on one eight so when the when the alarm found the eight [laughter] you know each goes to his or her student and they walk out together or some of them and neat and oxygen tanks or\nI'm sort of items to calm them down like blanketed spinners\nSome of them have these things called social story which are like um [noise]\nLike flash cards with visual symbol of you know a flame or um [noise] you know people lining up outside of a board of health uh students don't understand really what's going
