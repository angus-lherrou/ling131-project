running for office this year one fifth\nOf the female Democratic House candidates are under forty\nA sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition who tended to postpone political careers until their families were established Janet what's up here\nBut you know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall they're running for office but within that\nUm there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women in politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern and I and in other line of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi had five kids didn't run for office into\nThe I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven\nBy then by the time she started her political career um and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen wave of the women running signs that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency typically among democratic women who are running as a sense of urgency\nAbout running it you know we need to be part of the movement but also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a um I don't know ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess gets sent\n[noise] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats are real clamoring for generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints that the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of\nOf a movement soured on they also I think\nWomen in general and young women in particular bring\nMore focus and attention to a women's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um and you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of studied the style of leadership that women have brought to Congress and they she concluded that with more women in Congress and more with younger women\nThat there might actually be more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought was interesting too is the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled that campaign funds can be used to pay childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for the house in New York on Long Island her name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old [laughter]\nShe went ahead and um started running and was kind of relying on her mom for for childcare help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lot of money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to pay for childcare\nAnd lo and behold they issued this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark\nThat says I'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for office that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nSpeak with Janet Hook national political

law enforcement authorities in several major a major markets have noticed a flurry of recent steps\nMore from USA Today business reporter Nathan booming who's been researching this make them what's going on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that Honda's our susceptible to everybody that this is a climate is\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of the hundreds as well are being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that be the airbags can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases they break into the vehicle the they basically to hear it out of the steering wheel and then they fill it in the black market\nAnd it's in connection with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blows the airbag or is this tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens is when you need to get your bag replaced you have a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable a type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these cuts airbags end up being sold it if you actually go on E. bay for example in the search for this you will the barrier bags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealerships something you're not going to end up accidently buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these things\nShe saw it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happen to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nI definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that hundreds of long way targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact that they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is what only on because in talking to the police and various markets um you know almost every incentive\nThat it was exclusively on this so you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic conductors or something being exactly what it is probably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nYeah so at the the ... ah what uses ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nExactly they somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically a user knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes I to some incidents where\nYou know they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely um there's not a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know doing a laptop out for the seat in the car I mean you have to ... thousand dollars [laughter]\nThat's about how much does it work so there's a big incentive for the season you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so me and said that there's also gone up\nWell received with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in federal police the flurry of Honda airbags steps as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nA few different to you you

respect you are listening to America's wars in the morning when the\nWeather is walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or in districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain this\nTo what I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last sort of final stretch here has become closer than than people expect that they would\nAnd we're seeing that in particular in a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge amount [laughter]\nSo maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent for districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have come to satisfied with the president can\nTalk to one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and there is a third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people and becoming very competitive and that's the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler [noise]\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory\nIn recent years but this year has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congressman butler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as to the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual race there in that\nUm this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight race well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with the the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYeah probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap\nAnd and it reveals that women\nAre show more of a preference for\nA democratic controlled house and are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but\nIf that is indeed the case it looks like a women are more poised to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty three percent of the votes and not a huge blowout for hidden there\nYou ought to speak with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tighten as mid term elections near our to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes said this is an interesting race I'm kind of going with all its definitely being outraged by Carolyn a boy do who is also a professor at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar for a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down on the ticket and that\nUm are do could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and uh so do you know vacant seat Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy\nAnd then the second to the to Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada um this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nWings Christina

he was walking into Monday there is an influx\nOf young mostly democratic women in their twenties and thirties running for office this year one fifth\nOf the female Democratic House candidates are under forty\nA sort of them are women of color hundreds more are running for state legislature Wall Street journal national political reporter Janet Hook says the diverse crop of young candidates marks a departure from an older generation of women with ambition who tended to postpone political careers until their families were established Jenna what's up here\nWell you know there's been a lot of attention paid during this election cycle to the record number of women overall they're running for office but within that\nUm there's this really interesting trend of there being more younger women running I'm sort of under forty women in their twenties and thirties um and it's interesting to me because there's been a kind of a career pattern for women in politics I'm In the past\nIt's much like like the clear pattern and I and in other um lines of work where women would tend to wait until their children are grown before they take the plunge into politics and the classic case of this with Nancy Pelosi\nHad five kids didn't run for office until the I'm the youngest one was sixteen\nI'm and she was forty seven by then by the time she started her political career\nUm and I think what we've seen in twenty Eighteen wave of women running signs that women are also are a little bit less willing to wait that there's a sense of urgency specifically among democratic women who are running to the sense of urgency\nAbout running you know we need to be part of the movement also part of a broader idea that women can start their careers and their families at the same time\nYeah so what ... what happens if a um I don't know what ... what we might consider a significant number of them when I look at what kind of message I guess get sent\n[laughter] well I mean it's been broadly among Democrats a real clamoring for kind of generational change I mean there have been a lot of complaints that the leadership in Congress being all baby boomers and older uh so I think that it would kind of contribute to a sense of\nOf a movement forward um they also I think\nWomen in general and young women in particular bring more focus and attention to\nA women's issues you know the treatment of women family issues um and you know I talked to a political scientist who is actually kind of study did the style of leadership that women have brought to Congress and they she concluded that more women in Congress\nAnd more with younger women\nThat there might actually be a more collaborative approach to decision making\nYou know I thought was interesting too is the one line in your story about how some of these young women are already making a difference to federal election commission ruled that campaign funds can be used to pay childcare expenses\nRight my story actually features a woman who's running for the house in New York on Long Island\nHer name is Lou been Gretchen Shirley and she's thirty seven years old and she was thinking about running for the house and kind of reluctant at first because she had a one year old and a three year old she went ahead and\nUm started running and\nWas kind of relying on her mom for for childcare help and just when the pace of the campaign got too much she really felt like she needed to hire outside help didn't have a lotta money she petitioned the FCC to see if she could use campaign tons to\nPay for childcare and lo and behold they issued this ruling that said you could and it was kind of a landmark\nThat says I'm basically kind of recognizing the reality of when parents run for\nOffice that if they have children I'm part of the campaign has to be finding a way to take care of the kids\nSpeak with Janet Hook national political reporter at the wall Street Journal she's got to be entitled young women aren't waiting to seek political power I use it to their mobilizing not just as candidates but also as voters I guess that probably goes hand in hand but explain some of the numbers\n[laughter] well um the there's a democratic um data analytics firm called target smart that analyzes voter rolls and\nIt looked at um twenty five states that had held primaries to look at the turnout of voters in and they broke it down by different categories and one of the categories that they looked at was the difference between a younger voters voters and older voters by you know kind of looking at turnout by age group\nAnd what they found was has always been the case younger voters um\nTheir turnout rate is lower than older voters as we know you know old older voters really turn out in large numbers\nThings done at the

on\nYeah this is really interesting story I I was surprised to see that I conduct are susceptible Arabic that this is a crime that has\nExisted for many years but it's really a spike in recent years with late model Honda vehicles specifically the accord and civic although some of it as well our I'm being targeted by the two are\nRealizing that beat everybody can be worth more than a thousand dollars in some cases it's when they break into the vehicle the they basically cared out of the steering wheel and then they still in the black market\nAnd in connection with what just anybody who happens to be in an accident and blow the beggars is tied to the to Cato recall\nWhat happens when you need the gear bag replaced the a couple of different options course most people are going to go to the dealership going to go to the repair shop either place there um some people ever going to get it done this either going to have a friend or they'll go to maybe more disreputable a type of repair shop and that's where\nA lot of these types airbags end up being sold if you actually go on ... for example in the search for this you will see their airbags being sold on line so it's it's definitely happening um and it's it's a big concern you know if you go to a reputable dealer something you're not going to end up actually buying a user airbag or something but there is a market for these days\nShe's doing it and the reason that it's Honda's because they're popular vehicles and just happened to be more of them perhaps on in ...\nWell I definitely think that's a factor I mean there's no doubt that Honda's long targeted for theft but that's in part because of the fact they're popular but we don't make much sense to me is what only because we're talking to the police\nAnd various markets um you know almost every is looked at it was exclusively on you know it does you know it doesn't make much sense why would only be honest I'm not sure if it has to do with the actual specific Arabic and actors or some dean exactly what it is\nProbably the the only ones you know at this point I'm as we know they if there's money to be made though don't make it\nSo it is the phone what uses a night ... kinda strips away the covering of the center part of the steering wheel and just pulled it out I was at work\nThey somehow gain access to the ethical and then they basically uh\nYou did a knife and then they rip it out and it only takes a few minutes [laughter] um I I went to some incidents where\nYou know they hit dozens of vehicles in the same parking lot on the same night show you know it's it's definitely I'm\nNot a difficult thing to think about it this is like you know\nGiven a laptop off the seat in the car I mean if the left towards a thousand dollars at the bottom was worth so there was a big incentive for the ... and you know with all the recalls that have happened on airbags in recent years including the one that you mentioned Arabic prices have gone up so me and said that there's also gone up\nWell we're seeing with Nathan booming business reporter at USA Today he's written a piece in federal police the flurry of Honda airbags\nDeaths as criminals aimed to resell on black market how do you protect yourself or is there is there a best practice here\nThe different ... you probably consider here number one is we see in a park or vehicle near St late or near a parking lot late that can help because these aren't going to choose a vehicle that threaten or the late that copy the make them easy to spot\nAnd secondly I hadn't thought of this you can try not to park near a big vehicles that are maybe a structure\nThat the view so when the the kind of hide behind the big SUV or big truck that the one thing to consider and unless they
