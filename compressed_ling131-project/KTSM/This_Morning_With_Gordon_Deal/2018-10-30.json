completely different picture of what's going on an election or race than the English language audience\nAnd we found that that's not really happening however you see is that issues that they may highlight when they're talking to a Latino audience um might be one\nThat they put over in the background or any English so in other words not position but perhaps a little more talk about\nA border control um when you're talking to the English audience if you're in let's say ... ... ... ... talk about ... if you are a rich Rick Scott\nIn Florida so you know you just choose to emphasize that\nWhat about the actually speaking Spanish in the ads that happening\nIt happy a little bit um you know of anybody watched Bill Nelson and Rick Scott finished senatorial debating you'll notice that the image closing statements they try and talk a little bit of Spanish I sort of it seems to be kind of a hung jury on how much that actually helps for the most part\nThe different Latino but I spoke with said that they tend to get the candidates some credit or try to charity but they can do is just trying to memorize a couple of words can act\nLike you care and that's not going to ... yeah they want to to you know George W. Bush is I watch them do two thousand two thousand four where he had apparently to see your message I felt in\nExcuse me that the Latino audience felt like he was communicating what he what he actually meant and and what he really wanted to do anything from them you see\nJeb Bush's brother is fluent in Spanish but that didn't really have much on the presidential trail even though he was governor of Florida yeah they don't work in Texas\nSpanish is pretty accepted but he's getting a lot slower and we pretty much handle a commercial by himself Ted Cruz speak Spanish but he uses his father Raphael ... when he got the Spanish language over yet\nMm So what is just to drill down on that a little bit out of the the Ted Cruz message\nOr he plays on more of the uh the Hispanic heritage then he might in the English speaking at\nExactly a medic on or they call it the American dream um and of course that you know that's really I think a jail that resonates with a lot of the immigration or immigrant population and they choose to follow that same pack so when he talks about that ... Cruz where\nHe's down so she came from she talks about coming over here and started with\nJob of Seventy cents an hour and of course who wind up could you could assign assigned to Princeton and Harvard law allows US Senator\nOr a lot of Americans drove ... need to redefine it a little bit um why do you ever watched the debate between cruise into our\nCruisers really hammering award for ... for a ten dollar shirt tax on barrel of oil and it was really hammering him on Medicare none of those issues on the cruise we're bringing up in a Spanish language\n... speaking with James Barney national correspondent at the Washington Times he's written a piece titled candidates most uh modify message in Spanish I'm so it's a little more about what Rick Scott has done in Florida\nScott an actual tribe due to the Hispanic vote and of course he's been elected statewide twice as governor um when hurricane hit Puerto Rico last year\nScott really a kind of self ... book on he's made ... trips to the island who were greeting Puerto Ricans ... displaced ones when they arrived it for that\nSo when he goes to the ad out this week talking about writing on what the recount you were affected by the storm it doesn't look like he's just throwing less outright wow what he wants to be senator he actually has some history whether he can draw upon\nNext James James Barney Washington Times reporter is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]\n\nCapital one is building a better bank one that feels an ax nothing like a typical bank it's why they're reimagining banking and building something completely different", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "El Paso", "day": "30"}
