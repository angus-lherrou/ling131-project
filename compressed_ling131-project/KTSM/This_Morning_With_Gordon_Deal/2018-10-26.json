heat they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what our computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those theft estimate\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nation the United states included\nMy adding coal now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\nBut unfortunately you put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assumed that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be be eat a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where there are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level Roger and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... million of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally you want to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low latitudes\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that's part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up through Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there could be a tremendous amount of civil strife and wars over at the migration of people away from post\nBut this has been something that has been identified by law of American officials in the defense department and in the Central Intelligence agency\nDuring the Obama administration's climate change was considered a major threat multiplier and driver of probable future conflicts\nAnd again there's kind of a head in the sand mentality has taken\nRoot now in Washington which seems to pretend that this doesn't exist but this was widely acknowledged in the defense community as recently as ... years ago\nTo global climate change and increasing\nOr could definitely bring more wars\nYes there you go\nYeah well it is a terrible future if we can't get this under control and one of the big headline the\nSummer of twenty Eighteen million for at home may see sea level rise flooding over the rest of the century and in fact it is so bad that all the forty eight continental US state\nFlorida now has the most property at risk a study finds that three hundred and fifty one billion dollars worth of homes will be risking persistent title flooding\nThe researchers say if the global warming and sea level rise does continue that in more than one million properties in Florida\nWill have chronic flooding and that when you look at the map as it is extended by computers over the rest of the century\nThat sea level rise which is already\nOne of the big secret uh kept in Miami by the political institution there\nIs that they get flooding constantly on full moon constantly flooding on high tides they get constantly\nFlooding all over the time and everybody who live there now and that political governments and mirrors saying we're not going to let anybody know that we have flooding in the streets of Miami nonsense they've\nGot to take the bull by the horns and deal with it\nAnd as you look at the map uh knowing that the Arctic\nHas melted two to three times faster than the computer projection well George when you look at the map of what is expected to happen to Florida over the Next Fifty years and know that what happened with the Arctic was two to three times faster\nIf Florida at the water flooding let's say three times faster than the current computer that projection that I mean that most of the southern tip of a foreign will be uninhabitable and that leads back\nTo what

October statistically is no worse than any other month but it it said a month at some point to extremes a lot of bad things happened in October and a lot of good things happened October it's a it's a month when things go up and down a lot why that is I think it's just the luck of it\nAnd the trends right now a ... big these big tech firms have been kinda carrying the load when it comes to the the uh the rise for the indices\nAnd they have but it's important to bear in mind that the indices I'm not particularly high even before the recent fall a cartoon show for the U.S until the last twenty five years\nOn traveling um twelve month earnings average twenty five\nOr which would imply four percent rate of return uh right now which trading at about twenty two ... uh what corporate profits up so much this quarter and likely to continue rising although not at the same pace because this quarter was characterized by the extra boost\nFrom the tax cuts are still rising uh there's no reason to believe that the markets overvalued\nYou said in the piece that virtually every hot tech company of recent years faces new challenges you mentioned Facebook Twitter ... Apple Google Amazon what's going on for those companies\nWell with regard to the social media companies Twitter and Facebook there's the privacy issue same thing with ah with Google we go in the Amazon or there are problems with regard to anti trust the way they treat their business partners they're getting a lot of scrutiny over in Europe in that regard and that's ... come here sooner or later\nAnd met flicks is being investigated by the wall Street Journal [noise] uh for it's for its workplace practices or it's work environment\nA but it's important to remember you know when the market was up here twenty five on on price to earnings ratios these companies were far above that which meant that a lot of your everyday companies companies that carried the market in the past well below\nAnd now some of them are starting to get better prospects\nCaterpillar had a very good report pick a tank for just noting\nThat profits weren't going to grow in the fourth quarter like it and the third that silly maybe they were basically re stating the obvious but you know a lot of your consumer products companies people like Unilever nationally\nKimberly Clark now getting pricing traction they haven't had the last couple of years because of the rise of Amazon so I'm waiting to see and I think we will see\nIs the uh the profitability spread\nIt has spread and we'll start to see market investors pay more attention to outline companies which are doing very well right now\nWe're speaking with Peter Morici economists and business professor at the University of Maryland He's written a piece titled harrowing times for stock investors so to that point you said uh the market will have to get his girl from more traditional companies how's that going to happen\nWell I think that the the the investors will rotate is they recognize that that the tech companies have had difficulties also\nStocks have outperformed bonds by you know two to one no problem over the last twenty five years so well right now people are starting to dump into bonds should recognize that the potential profit squares and stock is just larger and when they go back the stocks\nOr they might none of that show heavily in an Amazon and so forth but rather to look at Macy's for example\nWhat about the fed in interest rates that factor in here\nNow that's a big question mark I I think that the fed itself and uh you know the various participants over there and private economists recognize that we're in a world where the natural rate of interest to the neutral rate of interest is about three percent perhaps a little less\nAnd the chart as them over shooting that I think they're going to if they have to pull back from that\nUh this notion that what we're going to raise interest rates and so we get there but not knowing where there is no where it is it's the rate increases away whether it's not over two years or three and it's time to sort of a either slow down or recognize that the limits about three percent so the marketing so panicked by their behavior\nWhich Peter Peter Morici economists and business professor at the University of Maryland\nThis morning the program as well do

countries have rigged the system so Americans pay more he says Americans are now going to pay the price as other countries pay\nHow could that work we're joined now by ... and president and founder of GDP advisors ... is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's actually possible for where the president can control certain things so specifically the proposal that ha just outlined targets Medicare's reimbursements specific drugs that are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nFor cures roughly forty percent of all drugs in the United states actually it is the consumer of these drugs and therefore\nIt sets under mandating a law how it's going to pay for these drugs so I just have the power to go back and say this is all the Medicare is going to pay for these drugs [laughter] this is how it's going to work and doctors are prescribing and and the ministry and these drugs are only going to get paid to some out\nOkay so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\nThat's the argument that they're already making on the heels of this announcement is that a visual stuff in their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements are of their cost and this is a step in the right direction I think upset for a long time\nThat the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer\nUh and and how they're paying for drugs and what President Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S pays in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries the challenge here though is that it's it's what the us pays\nSubsidized what the other countries don't at the end of the day this is still a profit margin issue for drug manufacturers\nRight All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing\nThe federal government has a consumer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think it's anti free market for that water part because the federal government in this case is a prince as a consumer the government is not setting here\nThe government is just saying what they will pay for these drugs and show in in this I mean we got to remember this is specific to doctor administered drug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff [noise] this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs already and the government's just saying we're not going to pay as much now this is also a problem because of the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically with us is targeting Medicare part B is actually the\nPiece of Medicare that reimburse of this and it pays doctors a commission for ministry ... through the traditional Medicare part D system which is the prescription drug plan to get out of the weeds here there's an\nUnintended adverse incentive for doctors to do a administered drugs to prescribe drugs and his challenges that at face value\nWe're speaking this morning with ... and he's the president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drugs or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nWas a couple of key things one isn't it the step slowly pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumers subsidizes the rest of the when it comes to drug\nChallenges you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug market and that is largely based on FDA requirement upbringing that drug now\nIn order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that the U.S patent all also gives factors a twenty year patent\nThose manufacturers are really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer so this is a complex issue and we really weren't caught this is a great first step but we also much reduced the regulatory requirements of bringing drugs to market soften that allow foreign testing\nUh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce the costs so you can have more competition and let the free market do what it does best innovate and compete\nOr some say a hey these CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies are not millions and millions that's part of the problem is that true or no\nWell listen I mean it all goes to the bottom line right and and and you can make the argument that CEOs making millions and millions of dollars and\nThat's the market value for those CEOs and this is this is the conflict in a capitalistic society when it comes to health care and I'm a free market capitalist but if a if a pharmaceutical company feels like it's necessary to pay their people that much [laughter] well that's what the

have rigged the system so Americans pay more he says Americans are now going to pay the price as other countries pay\nHow could that work we're joined now by step dense and president and founder of GDP advisors ... is this possible with the president plans to do\nGood morning you know it's actually possible for where the president can control certain things so specifically the proposal that ha chess I outlined targets Medicare's reimbursements of specific drugs that are administered in physicians' offices and so the Medicare system itself\nFor cures roughly forty percent of all drugs in the United states actually it is the consumer of these drugs and therefore\nIt sets under mandated law how it's going to pay for these drugs so I guess has the power to go back and say this is all the Medicare is going to pay for these drugs this is how it's going to work and doctors that are prescribing and and the ministry and these trucks are only going to get paid to some out\nOkay so then the pharmaceutical companies if I can try to guess what they'll say is well that's fine we now will no longer have enough money to do research and develop new life saving drugs\n[noise] that's the argument that they're already making on the heels of this announcement is that a visual stuff in their ability to reinvest or even make minimum bottom line requirements are of their cost and this is a great step in the right direction I think upset for a long time\nThat the federal government being the largest consumer needs to act more like a consumer\nUh and and how they're paying for drugs and what President Trump said yesterday is absolutely right in the U.S paid in some cases twice as much as other foreign countries\nThe challenge here though is that it's it's what the us pays that helps subsidize the what the other countries do at the end of the day this is still profit margin issue for drug manufacturers\nRight All right so is that approach than anti free market or no because we're describing\nThe federal government as a consumer\n[noise] yeah I I don't think it's anti free market for that part because the federal government in this case is ... is the consumer the government is not shutting here the government is just saying what they will pay for these drugs and show in in this we can't remember this is specific to Dr ... minutes\nDrug blood pressure medication or standard over the counter type stuff [noise] this is specific to drugs specific to like cancer multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis\nSo these are high cost drugs all ready and the government's just saying we're not going to pay as much now this is also a problem because it's the way the Medicare system works and this is specifically with us is targeting Medicare part B is actually the\nPiece of Medicare reimbursement is and it pays doctors a commission for ministry and they struck the traditional Medicare part D system which is a prescription drug plan to get out of the weeds here there's an\nUnintended adverse incentive for doctors to do a administered drugs to prescribe drugs and his challenges that at face value\nAnd we're speaking this morning with ... and he's the president and co founder of GDP advisors were talking about President Trump's attempt to lower the cost of Medicare drugs or why are the costs of drugs so high by the way what are the basics here\nA couple of key things one is and it's just absolutely pointed out in a real problem is that the U.S government as well as the U.S consumers subsidize the rest of the when it comes to drug\nChallenges you have and this is a multi layered complex situation is that it takes roughly on average two billion dollars to bring a new drug market and that is largely based on FDA requirement upbringing that drug now\nIn order to offset the cost and recoup the cost to do that\nThe U.S patent all also gives factors a twenty year patent\nThose manufacturers are really good about tweaking the drug at the end of that Twenty years later they keep it for a little bit longer to this is a complex issue and we really weren't caught a great first step but we also much reduced the regulatory requirements are bringing trucks to market soften that\nAllow foreign testing uh in in certain countries to be allowed in the U.S to reduce that cost so you can have more competition and let the free market do what it does best innovate and compete\nOr some say a hey these CEOs of these pharmaceutical companies are not millions and millions that's part of the problem is that true or not\nWell listen I mean it goes to the bottom line right and and and you could make the argument that CEOs making millions and millions of dollars and\nThat's the market value for those CEOs and this is this is the conflict in a capitalistic society when it comes to health care and I'm a free market capitalist but if a if a pharmaceutical company feels like it's necessary to pay their people that much well that's what the market provides", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "El Paso", "day": "26"}
