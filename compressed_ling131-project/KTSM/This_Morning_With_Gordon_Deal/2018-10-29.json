there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who do I want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but this particular case is an interesting one I'm

like ...\nAnd I'm I'm from loyal in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the

and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we've we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I'm going to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing fine books now I'm On this phenomena foreign demanding black and one of the women in black and I have\nTo say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI on the line is I\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies they typically are described as looking ... you know ... and the skins live\nWhite

sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women and black of turned up in homes right after

are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction piles but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know when you talk about the kind of shows you know you got a really weird and exploit couple and then some which are here to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black but you know in some cases I think government agencies all responsible for the paper I think it's a very small degree they really unexplained and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed elections are demanding black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words it might have a government you know that many black to radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't even\nFrom using the legend among hey\nAs a main too quiet April or may not want to have him talking about that I see so the government might actually not know how many black really are and

reliably\nConservative Supreme Court or knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after historically partisan confirmation by the justices may not answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happens with abortion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways it can be restrictions on the timing or the method where the funding et cetera\nAnd then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts um strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be\nSupreme Court precedent to those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take\nYou know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do\nAs much as they possibly can in these cases his swat them down and say we're not going to take him what would it be that lower court case decision was at the federal circuit court federal appeals court we are going to let that stand so that's going to apply with one would shake and a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court had the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time and it's like well\nYeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like eight thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those\nAnd the cases it takes a rider important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court shows the level right below the Supreme Court ah and they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often\nSplit I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue and one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this show a lot of these cases come either\nWe're on abortion now not reflect those kinds of circuit split the court can easily say\nI'm for instance here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they're directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court could simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled can stand before it just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough on all sides\nAnd the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything it might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can\nSay we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs are those bringing the case or want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want us uh but uh twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw\nA certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken touch a particular reasons like the ... or or or the disability if the fetus\nThe court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts and\nThat doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took\nA on this subject to the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth

S. P. S. all the mail that they handle so we're talking about tens of millions of packages\nGoing through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages I'm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that\nWe simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about this is that they're just a dropping this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening and I think that's sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often tend to do things according to the experts and so\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened it's suddenly ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing or you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far or sent to the the mail to the post postal service and so\nUm you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know it's just the value is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why ultimately um you know the less than the last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room ale and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these and also the private and private companies are I think it will really taking a close eye on these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know it took ... ski [noise] you know it's like Eighteen

opponents who have waited a decade or a reliably\nConservative Supreme Court are knocking on the buildings bronze doors but after he historically partisan confirmation by the justice is made on answer\nUSA today's Supreme Court correspondent Richard Wolffe says cases challenging the timing methods funding and providers of abortion or headed toward the high court at a time when chief justice John Roberts and his colleagues are seeking a lower profile rich explain\nBasically what happened to the portion is a mostly Republican and conservative state legislatures passed restrictions in any number of different ways that can be restrictions on the timing or the method where the funding\nEt cetera and then mostly lower court some state courts more often federal courts\nUm strike down those restrictions not always sometimes they I'm I'm allowed them but in more cases than not they strike them down\nBased on what they understand to be Supreme Court precedent so those cases you know move along through the pipeline and they take you know years and what the Supreme Court does frequently and what they are likely to do as much as they possibly can in these cases his spot them down and say we're not going to take 'em or whatever that lower court case decision was\nAt the federal circuit court federal appeals court we're going to let that stand\n[noise] so that's going to apply with one would think in a lot of cases including several that are now pending before the Supreme Court\nRight so the court has the ability to just say no to taking these cases but at any point can say now it seems like a good time and it's like well\nYeah another which the court gets um what's the number the court gets like H thousand ten thousand uh petitions a year to hear cases and it takes about one percent of those\nAnd the cases it takes a writer important national issues that it feels it has to weigh in on or very frequently it that they are cases where circuit courts those are the federal appeals court shows the level right below the Supreme Court\nAh and they they're sort of regional there are regional circuit courts and those are often split I'm two or three circuit courts may have ruled one way on an issue and one or two or three Supreme Court ruled another way I'm the same issue and and the Supreme Court says well we're going to have to resolve this so a lot of these cases coming to the court on abortion now\nNot ah reflect those kinds of circuit splits the court can easily say\nI'm a trench to here's an example of court and there's a couple of cases that are pending now these are cases that are not directly on the subject of abortion but they are directly on the subject of states that are trying to restrict funding to Planned Parenthood and the court to simply say\nUh the the way those courts have ruled stands report just wants to avoid controversial topics for now they've just been through this ... confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh it was very tough\nAll sides and the chief justice John Roberts who would normally side with Kevin on the conservatives on the court and might be anxious to eager to take some of these cases in another year simply doesn't want to do anything that might be seen as partisan\nWe're speaking with USA Today's Supreme Court correspondent ritual so to that point just clarify the Supreme Court can say we need more time to warm up or we want things to cool down and we'll take an abortion case when we for lack of a better phrase damn well pleased\nYeah they they wouldn't they wouldn't signal what they're going to do in the future they would simply you know a case goes through federal district court comes out one way or another dog goes to the federal appeals court comes out one way or another let's say because it's often the case\nThat anti abortion plaintiffs uh those bringing the case or want to go to the Supreme Court and say hey you know we want to ... a a a twenty week limit on abortions or we want to outlaw\nA certain type of abortion and the second trimester or we want to outlaw\nAbortions that are undertaken cuts of particular regions like the ... or or or the disability if the fetus\nThe court the Supreme Court only gets involved and says All right we're going to hear that case not because it's interesting because it basically has two because lower courts are ... of course ledge because legislatures in court you don't know what to do because there's a conflict between appeals courts\nAnd that doesn't happen very often I mean the last major abortion case that the court took a on this subject to the actual medical abortion as opposed to things having to do with like you know harassing\nPeople outside clinics or something like that was back in two thousand and chef and it had to do with partial birth abortion and then in two thousand and six team just a couple of years ago it had to do with a Texas law that was restricting clinics restricting providers\nThanks rich USA today's
