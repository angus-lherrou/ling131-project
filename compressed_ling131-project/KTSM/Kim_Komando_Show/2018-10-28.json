{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "It or not and it's just resulting in really a chaotic healthcare system so it's good to see that um we are aware of these problems and now the question is what are we going to do to fix it\nRight\nTalking about Texas how\nSchools do we have in the state of Texas\nRight now we have a Thirteen and we're about to have Fifteen total\nWhat two more coming so there's the University of Texas in Galveston\nIs a University of Texas in Houston Medical school there's Baylor College of medicine there's south western college medicine in Dallas there's TCU College of medicine that just started this year this fall just admitted a I think forty students just this fall twenty Eighteen\nThere's north Texas College of medicine this was ... school of medicine\nThere was a Texas a and M. University College of medicine um then you have the U. T. del school of medicine out of uh Austin and as you teach San Antonio College of medicine and then there's something called a ... word University College of osteopathic medicine\nI'm now there's new medical school that just started twenty sixteen the UT Rio Grande valley down in um accounting ... area um it's really good to see that one especially because there's been such a long term doctor shortage\nYou know in South Texas really and also the border as um but really all Texas but especially south Texas on the border regions and of course his ... College of medicine and a lot back in a in an El Paso as well and then we have these two\nThe two new ones will be um there was Sam Houston College of medicine some Houston University is ... College of medicine is an osteopathic institution as well and then the University of Houston is also commissioning I'm In the early stages of a commissioning a process of\nEstablishing a school of medicine as well now Houston is really interesting because\nIn the past the attempted to do this and they were shut down by um UT and Baylor in Houston so you can see that [laughter] medical school in higher education and in Texas is very politicized but um this was an early to thousands and they failed a University of Houston failed and so now what\nThese new studies that have come out showing that you know the doctor shortage is real um I Hope that they will succeed this time of day thing that they will\nRight so why would you say it's a total number of how many medical schools are in the United states\nSo we have a hundred and forty medical schools in the United states and about thirty or so osteopathic\nMedical schools um\nAs you mentioned earlier there was a projection of I'm\nClose to a hundred and twenty thousand\nDoctor a projected shortage of a hundred and twenty thousand by your twenty thirty I'm here in Texas um I think the numbers that have seen linger around forty thousand by twenty twenty five which is\nYou know just right down the road from um from from our time now so\nI'm so you know we'll have to either do stuff like increased the number of medical students and each medical school class which has already been done already but apparently it's not even touching [noise]\nYou're listening to El Paso cures radio program on key TSN six\nUm ... had they give you [noise] um [noise]\nWhat is happening to this is [laughter]\nWell versed I tell you know you know so of course sports takes us away from it's a nice diverging from you know all of a serious thing that we face in life\nAnd football um it's really the one of the major sports that we turn to um you know the cowboys ... so [laughter]\nThey you know this week their owner Jerry Jones stated that oh he was asked that question\nI'm In an interview and he said that that the cowboys have not had a number one receiver for several years\nNow that's interesting because they had um someone named as Bryant who was um\nUh started wide receiver for the cat was for many years and Jerry Jones decided not to sign him\nBecause he was twelve million dollars that apparently he hasn't been living up to that ... million dollar yesterday so I happened was a few years ago twenty fifth any sign of seven a year contract Seventy million dollar contract I should say and I'm so he didn't fulfill his duties as as well so now but but he was a very effective player\nSo now that he's caught they had no one like him\nAnd what I don't understand is that you have basically depleted the team of talent\nAnd and so their points of down their records now two and three they haven't really look good at all\nAnd so they have this uh started running back into the kill alley yet and that's about really the only play maker they have um the hope ah everyone's hoping that they will bring doesn't buy it back\nAnd uh but doesn't look like it's going to happen I think uh everybody's moving along\nRight well let's see what happens [noise] doctor thank you very much for your insight you can leave when I was hurting\nMe feel much much better with their patients silly and and there has\nTo mention our engineer behind the glass and amber riches who do this before just a quick word in Spanish\nThat must be on the east coast but I you know I said\nWell you can\nSee it every now and that still stand in is\nThe same\nGuy that you guys yes ma'am and not just the money so hot\nAt least a year from Washington\nLaid off and try and keep our little kids and realizing that mommy and daddy

this next story over at the New York times I think about this data collection speaking of technology\nHow much do you think your personal data is worth I mean everything that you do every website that you visited everywhere you go the TV shows that you watch the products that you buy it's all fair game for advertisers now even when you take\nThe kids temperatures listen to this\nThis flu season Clorox paid kittens\nIt's a tech startup that sells Internet connected thermometers now these aren't the Mummers we used to have his kids like you know mercury Glasser monitors this smart throughout murder will sync up with a smartphone app that allows you to track fevers and symptoms okay get this\nThe data shows Clorox which ZIP codes around the country have increases in fevers\nClorox then directs more advertisement to those areas assuming that house oh they're going to be the market for products like what do you think this infecting wipes yes you follow me Kansas says they have sold more than five hundred thousands thermometers\nAnd the data's coming right out I'm In real time people don't have to visit a doctor to search for symptoms on Google or post something on Facebook about being sick\nSo now Ken the it's selling its data other companies pharmacies manufacturers that distributes medicines cough cold products right to the retailers show\nHasn't this gene you sell a product that collects data that you can then sell and\nMake even more money we should have thought about this [noise]\nI ride I mentioned this before but now we have some of the official leaks that's right do by a math book a mini an eye pad or an IMAX before October thirtieth just keep that credit card in your pocket this weekend folks because I've told me thirty is is when apple has its next big reveal\nThe ... air and the Mac many they haven't seen updates for some time\nActually middle of twenty Seventeen or maybe late twenties fourteen as far as the MEK many goes\nAll right the Mac many is

new I pad pros moral smaller Bezos maybe some brand new\nAir ... to also unveiled iPhone eye pad I Mac\nThat's right I pay for it and on the topic of iPhones and I was ... there's been a device that could crack open the password on the iPhone was called grey key\nIt used to work but not anymore in Iowa was twelve or they actually cut that off to the question of course is how long before they come up with yet another way to break into the iPhone was when there is going to be a worker out [noise]\nLet me tell you something you're in the world attack they already know how to do the work around we just haven't heard about it yet [noise] and\nFinally people really love their virtual assistance so much so news out this past week that over a million people has asked Amazon's Alexa to marry them that trade over the last year [noise]\nThat's not even including customers who might have proposed to their Google Assistant Apple's Siri or Microsoft court conduct [noise]\nIt seems that more than a handful of the estimated six hundred million people who use virtual systems every day [noise] they've been inspired by that movie her you remember that with Joaquin Phoenix than scarlet Johanson\nSo Andrew as many of our listeners know our very own my James he has struggled in the marriage department trying to crack [laughter] yeah I don't think it was a fan of actors remember you and I I'll

uh there's really not a lot\nYou can do because the six year old process or especially with today's video streaming and programs in games and everything else that they might be doing is still a six year old process or write\nA day and\nThe good news is there is any good news is that the next week a on the thirtieth of October I mentioned briefly during the news segment at the beginning of this hour\nIsn't it yeah is that apple is set to release a Mac will care for okay they say under a thousand dollars but you know the prices and then you know yes exactly [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I Know I hate when people do that it's like under a thousand dollars of thought to say yes it's nine hundred and Ninety nine dollars right\nA little tough and so you know and your other options that you look at refer a and\nSo if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page crack and then there's an option and the second comment says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff they're going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever may be and so what I live with you by refer golfer apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has to be replaced they do that it also still comes with a one year guaranteeing warranty\nAnd so you still have that but it's still gonna be you know you're still looking for you know twelve fourteen hundred bucks\nOh she living it let me ask you questions I talked to a guy at will the apple store here a little while back and he was talking about putting a fish is ask Dr in or something\nIs easy it's going to fatherhood dot Gov rocky by the U.S department of health services and renting\nThem [noise]\nAll right if you're not getting the free command a pod cast come on what are you waiting for

action Walmart is going to be trying to take you away from Amazon dot com is how they're going to do it\nThey're an offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now right [noise] and they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership fade and take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart kept saying because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return label from your online Wal Mart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Wal Mart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore they're gonna start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine does this whenever he goes to Wal Mart went announcement comes on over

I'm Sorry [noise]\nAnd then there's also target they're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they say hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free today shipping at target dot com [noise] All right so Walmart says we're going to give you a free to day shipping\nTarget says ... to give you free to day shipping on select items a target also has a few ... do you have to use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody's saying wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime\nTargets as we have another idea they have the drive up surface okay shoppers can place their orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into\nYour car and it's going to be available at a thousand stores I never\nUnderstood why that is even an option white somebody and\nTarget thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're gonna buy at target is still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car versus just going to prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered that day\nIt seems even with the grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who was arrested they fight fries oh price okay you have to do it like fourteen hours in advance\nWhy bother you know I go to a prime now ... the prime now that I was on a ... I was like three PM and by five thirty I have fresh salmon fresh vegetables\nAnd I bet you know here's the difference though is that I was at my sister's house was mentioned and we needed to buy buy some stuff for dinner and she said well I'll just go over to whole foods I said no no no let me show you how this works 'cause she's not that computer savvy\nI go to prime now and she's like well why would I buy all this on line I can just go to get my car and go to the store\nAnd like well Christine they don't have to go to the store it you know you're just going to come to you and she was going to now she went to whole foods she said she likes to go to whole foods but speaking of target you know what we've been talking about my because Mike\nAsked election and Mary and things like that like he might get this is actually a good idea for you is that you go to target to okay can you address nice for work right so you go to target what do you think about it or\nYou go to the dollar spot right there in the front door the front yeah just where they have everything for a dollar and you just hang out there might but you're going to find a cube woman and you know that she likes to
