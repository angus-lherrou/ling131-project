California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well a little confused\nUm we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\nG. P. N. app but when I'm using up like ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I researched telling blurry I thought it was good his bad differently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on a public why buy everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com past whatever maybe is that anybody can just pluck that out of the year\n... and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that it's going to use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up to us is traveling the airwaves you won't be able just pick it out OK\nOkay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use\nWhen you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany\nOh how fun yeah can't wait\nOh I'm so excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're ... this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or paper daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and his augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool and then the other thing are ... are you went to like military stuff ah my husband is okay there's a museum\nAnd I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right question songs and you know people do a food toward any of the city has to be great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your armpit or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on their cars like hide your\nWhatever uh then there's Nord VPN and then there's also freedom VPN which they were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure\nAnd it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a common that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nYou heard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay just if you don't do anything else and get them out okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right\nAnd they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nWe do and thank you for having me um we ... the net dot com just wanted to really quickly as you mentioned say this is a great way at

a yummy tofu salad though in the way by they say probably not [noise]\n[noise] hey also this past me Google had their big product announcement here's what they want you to by surprise surprise to get a brand new set of ... that's right the pixel three is one of their brand new phones a five point five minutes just but it's going to set you back eight hundred bucks\nThen there's the pixel three ... a six point three inch display starts at nine hundred bucks this is interesting and I got some camera upgrades of course they all do but they have a new color called not take\nWhat should we call this color that's not take that work\nThere is also an official charging stand there is now the slate twelve twenty three\nInch tablets eight hundred bucks I mean like androids stuff has some check out\nA there's also the home hub this is their smart speaker bolted down hundred and fifty bucks as Ghost Ship on October twenty second comes in green bank not paying a dark gray and white and also has built in you too isn't that fabulous maybe not\nBut this whole hub is actually something is really a fascinating it's not as robust as Amazon's Alexa but it's a really strong competitor and the reason why I bring this up is that if you have somebody on your shopping list for Christmas and they like Android and Google or something you might want to check out\nAnd says I mentioned a hundred and fifty dollars but some of the cool things that can do can turn it into a digital picture frame you're not using it there was no camera onboard either so if you're a privacy conscious and keep that in mind but when it is a digital picture frame of tasks into all your photos that you have up in the cloud and Google Photos again good Christmas present for those Android folks\nOn your list and one of the cool things about the new Google products is maybe just may be a stop to all the robo callers and the scammers because here's the deal the new go Google Pixel phones are going to screen your calls to stop the robo callers and scammers\nAnd Apple's linked to the game but they this past week said oh we're going to kind of have that they filed a patent called detection of spoof call information\nIt is going to enable an iPhone to check whether the calls legitimate and if not you can get a call alert no ring no vibrations got a check against established legitimate call parameters but it's not

isn't under appreciated art form\nLet's fix that Samson we've been putting out fires for years [noise] or ride this final story is a total mystery\nThink about this if you're wearing a smart watch is keeping track of your beats per minute well how exactly does that work what is going on why would a fitness tracker detect a beating heart\nOn a roll of toilet paper that's what you heard me right a roll of toilet paper if you put your smart watch on a roll of toilet paper it will say that it's beating eighty one\nBeats per minute\nI tried it out myself Chinese tech site advocates report this past week the toilet paper is having a viral moment because fitness tracker owners have discovered they don't just play a heartbreak when attached to her role\nThey also tested others cylinder object a bottle a can a banana even in an appendage of a stuffed animal all of which showed this mysterious Santorum heart rate like\nAs I mentioned the toilet paper a BPL of eighty one a coffee mug at a BP em ups Seventy two banana Seventy two beats per minute [noise]\nAnd it's not just other fitness trackers also the apple watch the Android where similar results here's the deal to detect a heartbeat trackers former green light on your wrist\nBlood absorbs the green light so when the blood flows faster it absorbs more green light to there are some signs for you this process known as ... she says it's simple way to detect how fast someone's heart is beating since bananas and mugs have services that are more reflective than toilet paper\nMakes sense that it's going to have a heart rate that more consistent than say the roll of toilet paper but you might be thinking to yourself we need to get to the bottom of this [laughter] if I were too busy we're on a roll as you get that [laughter] [noise] okay\n[noise] All right let's talk about how you're sleeping at night because everyone knows that sleep is so important especially for your health\nNow the mattress you sleep ought affects

intellect and value did okay um he wants to talk about Kanye West\nYes but it's more of the tax side\nOf the con us we're we're not getting into politics no not at all at all love I'm Adam whatever who cares but the Internet was reacting to Conyers phone\nFirst of all we learn Kanye West uses a cell phone because he took out that phone and it's an iPhone and the unlocked it to show the price of the United states a guess okay when he ... that he was on camera\nSo everybody got his pass code correct okay can you guess what is ... let me give you a hint\nVery similar to yours well you know I have I saw it on them alert to you okay I saw that headline that they pass code was\nZero zero zero zero zero zero correct six zero which you know that used to be\n[laughter] until ... when did you change it this morning I saw that blind [laughter]\nAnd so now it's it's a lot more difficult for you to break into one one one one one close seven Seventy seven seven seven seven that's far from the zero zero right much harder the other thing that the Internet was criticizing Kanye West for tech wise\nWas that he had his phone in a case yeah I Want the big deal about\nThat it's not cool it's no longer cool to have your smartphone in a case\nSo who's saying that it's not a cooler these people that are ... are they like trust fund kid that are being as those of us that have to shell out ... you know a hundred thousand Fifteen hundred bucks on a phone I don't want it to shatter if I drop and the criticism is\nIs that you can get tempered glass on the front and you no longer need the case on the back unless you have a multi that's going to charge it there's no reason to have a case well that's what\nThe Internet was attacking or there's stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty get mine's pink my black okay but the reason why it's pink is so that when I throw it into my black per se I can find\nWell that's why if you got one like me I have a rose gold iPhone it'd be easy to find in my purse\nFew guy with a rose gold phone and the only I for some and blows bad I brought a case on it anyway what does it matter\nSo we were talking about Chinese password yes zero zero zero zero zero zero\nThere was a call for everyone to try and hack his social media accounts so they wanted to use\nEmail addresses and log in and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that's what his past where it is so then came out the stories about horrible past for us to have and I learned something which is surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter]\nI've never heard about password walking you've never heard a password walking never\nThat's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter and your\nPassword most popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are okay that's the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nThing and then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is the first two rows\nAnd let me tell you something if you were to just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass what exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary got word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords um so do I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your or second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's why I Hope\nTo choose to verification is so great especially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password\n'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an Yahoo apple my phone they send me a message through the app and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the OSCE yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nI'm gonna tell you something now my space and linked him yes they bowls since two thousand sixteen if I've huge security breach\nOf in their website ... can you get in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used in ... in\nThis is really a tough one I don't know these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde\nHair [laughter] my space and linked him yeah just use it as their password but when that Mustang that's probably the these are brands of so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy\nThat's a brand Skittles again but Brandt okay but you can use the password Skittles if you're not using it for your skills to count [laughter]\nGet a side hustle and then perhaps some quick and easy ways to make a buck and we're looking at sites like

if you could recommend a website or a resource that would function something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using an app or using a program to accomplish the task I get done and I go up there and easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that said here's what I did at grandma's house on Tuesday for effect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard isn't there a publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nI see if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yeah so we used to fly you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that they use these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book do yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular ... that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it there's John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kinda fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really\nLove yes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take\nMonths to make those animation and so so and so the next time you have a task put in front of you Tom\n... okay\nOkay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your questions things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nOr for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call and give a call to the show and fewer Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join ... right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what's Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the Kim commando show\nUse right now I'm a I'm In El Paso\nWith more and more of our lives moving on line intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences\nOne great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and untraceable online is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network\nWhen choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it and I recommend F seek to our freedom VPN F secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nF secure even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online or to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount code camp visit F dash secure dot com slash camp that F dash secure dot com slash camp\nHi I'm Lana cloth and a farmer ...

would take a Tutti picture\nAnd then make it appear three D. whatever you post on Facebook now beginning to roll out to everyone uh allowing you they say to bring seems to like oh you do is you take a photo in portrait mode\nThen you start creating a new post on Facebook you tap the menu at the top right used to like three D. photo basket and bring you up to the photo folder on your phone you

Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this and back to the phones we go with oh let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nHim hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right yeah my question it's okay to fail all along reputation management mhm I guess my first love to be like what would be the best ... that I can find for small medical office and also what I was looking at it that was\nAll or a I'm a software that you are just and then the at the search engine optimization ethical would all all all\nAll right well let's talk a little bit too so what's going on with your business on line\nAll the problem with them or if\nIt's obviously what most of us have is\nYou know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden were able to balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go on line at the post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so when I'm Out here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay [noise]\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do with it and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\nBut and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical ... it's like ... grade a car okay all they need they excel\nSo okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay so anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal that front\nThat says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee you that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for\nYou know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust dropped them up in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay\nOkay so that's the\n... the other thing you can get let me finish the other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note\nAnd say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it and\nWhat I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program\nCalled recognize Dr status and that'll put you at the top and then we'll also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore so\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up was a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nIs that to to\nAccentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization and to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars we'll
