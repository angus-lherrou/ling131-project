up to ... hours and there was a notation saying that if you wanted to you know people want there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well here's ... good\nOh no I was just a you know so here's the deal is that you know he the the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] I mean that's another issue\nOkay alright that's sad when there's a a depending upon the carriers of ... do you know who the carrier is a belief that ...\nOkay if the mobile has a to 'em because he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone okay\nIs that the carriers and they also they have something like family located or packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but what I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at\nAn okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he want to even in normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that\nBut not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. P. S. Glen and Glenda glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the tea mobile website looked at their family low cater\nLike I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly in paying somebody and if not look at that glimpse program that glimpse at rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for your call

a muffin the awkward etiquette of\nI had it be and I don't know if you've noticed it but I certainly habit wherever you go where somebody choosing square and they're on their eye pad or on their phone\nIs that they want to get tips for just about anything out there have you noticed that Andrew\nI'm so glad that you found this dinner bringing this up this is such a pet peeve for me it's on but I don't want to name a possible I don't out a possible sponsor our future sponsors so I'll just say there's a place it is called bone marrow Brett [laughter]\nI'm Talking and code and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly delicious food yes get the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had but every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed this seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you but if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do\nThat if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay quite a farmer's market\nI bought spinach pasta was twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on there that you tip\nSo my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is and what I Love about in the coal is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional sheets on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business accurate\nAnd it's something she uses square and to you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk or anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent\nSo I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to tap\nAnd there'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to [laughter] you know the third call them which is the goal of all businesses have people out of more money than I thought I explained to her I said so you know you're married\nYou got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and they are in the rye and they need a new you know they're getting ready for college showing their cheek bones we can really hungry or whatever it may be\nA said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nSee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are gone like thirty per se\nBut she isn't that different though because that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut it's the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great\nSo when you're a bone marrow do you tip yeah really I Do that's why they keep asking because people like you keep the okay here's the\nReason why gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston right and and when you wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat\nSo if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want to but at that but I have an air and drabs okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something and\nThey had to tip jars okay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nWere a basket beach in California that's just south of half moon bay\nAnd is it is a beautiful there\nWell today the fog Israel and a little bit but it's really nice should be maybe in the low seventies but it's always got a little chill coming off the water\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband ... just because we have here\nThat's it and they are they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is helping the bus\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you got this way everybody has the picture and\nUm I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been RV\nWell great things I mean every day's\nAn adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have from it and you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator Airbus and\nIf you're ... decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up their\nOpening a systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we're going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side when does it take off\nAnd have a pick up outside and basically toss it out the window [laughter] um [laughter] shorts generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your mother board in the refrigerator while\nIt's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it ... it\nWas it was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] I [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question and I bet you're you will have input on so how give us a question\nAh basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early day adventures which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of uh\nA state of obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D piece cites a which is a file transfer sight\nOf that we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and\nTwenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital or we decided to call the gym commando show so here you don't\nAnd so so what the thought is Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig that's huge really huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is that you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\nYeah and then you can delete it\nWell you or you can protect it yeah you are protecting put it in on it you know with a um a private you are oh oh okay\nSo that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all can\nI mean right that\nThey do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up well totally miss you guys\nDo it's very much pleasure to be able to talk to you to\nReally break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three\nOf hell and Jackie on the road because if you're an RV or they have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends say right where you are more coming up here on the Kim commando show\nGuiding them\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life parents teachers dentists and always a different technique up and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes\nOf course Ninety percent of us don't have most of the shoes worn out toothbrushes to boot so let me introduce you to quip quip is electric it's small light and sleek there's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quip\nNew brush heads are automatically delivered justice dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTry quit and see wide backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts to just twenty five dollars that's it\nDoes it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.
