English results for example with a Spanish accent or with a French accent or an Indian accent or listen to French\nCanadian spent really something\nAnd this next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends who say they've been working on a brand new product at let's Android users control their device using only their voice\nIt's been in beta a really long time two years but this past week ago started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice author you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd say like click seven for example\nYou can say

can download voice access through Google Play [noise]\nKevin right up and just a few moments we have five route or security settings to turn on before it's too late and then later on this hour\nThe things that you should not be even thinking about buying\nAs far as technology goes in the month of October but back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington and her neck\n[laughter] actually are you I'm good what's going on [noise] um\nI've been looking into some money making ... um the ones where you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so\nI'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are or you may be inviting trouble your phone New Delhi and possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are all really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nA living you know on a bus extra months\nHere it's it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or anything like that you know some of the ap she mentioned like\nWag bucks is the one that led to watch to the shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping uh there's I poll this way it's something that allows you to take surveys a Google also has their opinion out that will pay you one dollar per survey you know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to ... came up and says hey you know we have a task Korea and so I've heard you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Costco\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the up and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like once called folk\nF. O. A. P. that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise] uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nOr you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat calling for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translated into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate money making apps over my website says that help you

with a check well what about if somebody called you and this\nHappened listen to this ... bags and a small Portland credit union last week he got a call himself from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first to let them go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer\n[noise] so he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio made to his debit ATM card [noise] she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHere we told the lady listen I'm going to replace him card immediately about travel out of state California well the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California\nOr those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem any charges that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\n\nWe're going to freeze the card everywhere else and he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably do me a favor she didn't said you know it just to make sure that everything is on the up and up or just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect ... is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said it's just the correct

three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet\nAnd he said yeah up yes\nSo at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right then she says\nSo that I can apply the same PIN number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you I can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have\nRight now and he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nThat he hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account so what this scammer head was\nEvery single thing about him\nExcept for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had to duplicate the card she had the number she had everything in front of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't\nThat where would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy
