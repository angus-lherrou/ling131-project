Sunday were open by appointment Tuesday through Saturday tend to six today the hours are a little bit shorter because we're going to be working outside the store\nYou can call the store five eight four oh to to if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them for you [noise] so remember when it comes to knowledgeable information and knowledgeable staff comes as Susan eyes and [noise]\nSo I wanted to tell you a little bit about things that I have to do to keep up\nNow when we get involved in a praising things and it's not as you go to school you learn how to do it and that's it\nThings change laws change materials change um the market changes so if you went to school to become a ... just Thirty years ago and you've never taken a course since\nThat's like going to kindergarten and I'm now being an adult and not going through secondary school you have to keep up with everything and I'll tell you why and a few minutes\nAnd so with the appraisal certifications that I have I have one that I have to read and take a test and pass every year every year I have another one another to that I have to take a refresher course\nEvery two years [noise] and I have those same too I have to re certify every five years and the re certification is\nI'm going to a class for three days and then submitting a an appraisal report to be sure that I'm up to speed and keeping up with all the new changes now there's something called the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice\nThose are minimum standards set by the appraisal foundation [noise] the appraisal foundation was established by Congress\nTo oversee and to set minimum standards for all appraisers however it did you know that most appraisers have never even heard of use pap and the reason is that you don't have to be certified in Texas\nTo appraise anything I could any of you could put a door or a sign out your door that say you I'm a praised diamonds and you would be\nYou could be sued if you didn't know what you were doing but as far as not having any kinds of um degree or accreditation it's not require which is really sad there should be some minimum standard so use path was developed and every two years we have to resort to certify with these path\nAnd use ... gives a lot of ethical consideration is a lot of procedural requirements things that we have to follow if we're doing appraisals for federal purposes for instance a state tax gift tax\nUm anything that involves the IRS\nOr anything regarding a banker trust department all those kinds of things require us to be used ... compliant\nAnd so I'm constantly taking the courses obviously and as much as\nI might think oh I Wish I didn't have to every time I go I learn something new and it's always worth while especially 'cause there's other appraisers that are in my same level of accreditation at these courses and so we ... we compare notes\nAbout things that happen and about situations and how we would handle them and all kinds of things so\nI'm the education is paramount\nNow that's just on the appraisal side but how do you uh praise the diamond if you can't determine if it is one or if it's treated or if it's a fake or if it's a composite stone or if it's irradiated dye laser I'm a glass filled you can't\nSo all those things affect the value so\nI have to keep learning because those are the standards I have set for myself a on learning about the new treatments now because of China and the world wide market now on line people are buying but they don't know what they're buying they they don't even know who they're buying from\nNow most of the time you probably don't care if you're buying shoes\nOr if you're buying [noise] I don't know if something else that's you know a notebook but\nWhen you're buying something of value that's going to be the symbol of your love and commitment for the rest of your life you need to be buying from someone that you know who they are\nYou know what their level of education is for instance some people think that just because of diamonds certified that\nThat's all you need to know well that's not all you need to know because we find mistakes on lab reports and not only do we find mistakes\n\nWe also find that sales people give the wrong certificates to the customers and so all their life they have this lab certificate on the dime and they\nCome into salad and I take one look at it and compare and I said this does not go\nWith this diamond well if it's ten years later good luck it's pretty hard to get the original\nThat store may be out of business or [noise] um they might just say I'm Sorry it's too old you should have come you know you should have let us know this before I don't know how other stores work I only know how I work\nI'm the one exclusively that handles and sells the diamonds because I Believe that you need to be a master ... just appraiser to be able to sell a diamond and to knowledgeably answer the questions that the customers are going to ask\nWe also don't allow gassing or making up answers if you don't know we have either myself or we call GI a I Would say we call GI maybe three times a month to ask questions to get clarification on gemstones\nTo get procedural things a noted all kinds of things reasons that I'm constantly calling the school the gym a logical Institute of America where I went to school to ask questions so that I can give the correct information to the customer\nAnd I can tell you story after story of people coming in here and telling me what they've heard which are things that are not true\nAnd I'm not sure if it comes from a lack of education or\nJust a desire to answer a question that you don't know without saying I don't know I'm not sure what it is\nBut when I hear these things I just cringe because it's important that when you buy a piece of jewelry you know what carried it is what the quality of the stones are that you know all those things because you're spending thousands of dollars\nIt would be like going to buy a car and and talking to someone that works in the office\nAbout um the car and all the specifics and how it runs and what the gas mileage as or things that might not be on the ticket that's on the window things about maybe the company or history of you know what the value would be ten years from now all those kinds of things\nAre something that requires studying and and updating and all kinds of efforts to be able to tell you the right story and so when we come back I'm going to take a quick break I'm going to tell you about my last\nBit of education which was really fabulous we'll be right back to just give us about one minute [noise]\nLike\nMiller [noise]\nNine eleven or just a few of the heroes we homes for
