for listening too crazy about jewelry radio I'm Susan eyes and author of crazy about jewelry the expert guide to buying selling and caring for your jewelry\nAnd you're listening to my weekly radio show where we talk about tips in trends with jewelry gemstones gold and silver watches are coins and inheritance issues\nSo I Hope you're having a wonderful Saturday if you want to call into question while we're on the air you can give us a call at five four four five eight seven six\nYou could also go on to Susan ... dot com and hit the contact us button or you can go to Facebook Twitter Instagram or ... and send me a message that way so today I have a guest I'm very excited\nBecause I've been involved in the El Paso estate planning council for a little while now\nAnd um we're sponsoring an event that we're gonna talk about and so with me today it's his is costing knows he's the vice president senior international financial advisor at Merrill Lynch\nAnd he does a lot of estate planning and since I talk about that all the time on the radio I thought wouldn't it be nice if we had someone that's knowledgeable sitting right here talking about estate planning so hello has this\nAfternoon Susan thanks for the opportunity\nOh sure so let me ask you first why did you get involved in the state planning\nWell I in my work at Merrill Lynch I I'm a certified financial planner professional and so stay planning goes hand in hand with the investment management that we that we don't we were held more clients way\nAnd so I'm as a senior international financial advisor tell me a little bit about what that means\nSo essentially what that means is that we help clients first of all take inventory of their assets essentially identified the assets and then try to match that with their goals while we helped clients also defined our goals into what they want to accomplish whether it's retirement what it is whether it's college funding for the children\nGrandchildren et cetera and so what we try to do is help them manage those gases to\nSuccessfully accomplished those outcomes which is their ultimate goal\nAnd buy assets that's where I come in because ... says talks about financial assets and over here we talk about art and jewelry assets and things that people don't even think about will need estate planning\nSo give us a story a quick short story about something that you did a with estate planning that my listeners would be interested in hearing\nWhat one of the things I think that I came across recently was um when I was sitting down with our clients\nIs you know as you discussed the many different aspects that they have and the trust that they place than us you know they start opening up about where and how they keep their funds and what I find sometimes interesting is that how\nIndividuals keep a their own personal notes to account for their reserves and thought that was funny in that uh sometimes they have their own very personal\nWay of accounting out how they mark the reserve that sometimes many many of these on on many of these occasions sometimes even the spouse does he know about it or there there are other family members don't know about it and so it just how each individual approach as they are they're planning\nAnd you know we've talked about that on the radio before\nAbout where you're will is and where your original will is and how it's important for someone to know where it is and that copies are not as good as the originals and it's interesting what ... saying because a lot of people do hide things\nAnd they have places and files in their home where they keep things but they never told anybody where they are so then what happens they pass on and nobody can find the paperwork or their certificates or anything like that so\nIt sounds like what you do have this is really a help to a lot of the heirs and the people before they die\n... yeah that's true and I think one of the things that that we really focused and I think we're our group expelled is in in providing that personal service to our clients in helping them along the way throughout the process and helping them stay abreast of everything that except on how\nTheir estate planning could be affected and things to consider\nWhat I like about the estate planner that I Know is there all credential certify they have to take continuing education they don't just one day wake up and put a sign out on their door that they're a certified financial planner and that's the same thing with us here at Susan eyes and\nAs far as credentials go I have to keep up with what's going on with art and jewelry and gemstones and legal issues so that I can provide the best type of appraisals possible\nSo you got involved in the estate planning council ... probably because for the same reason I did is that right\nThat is correct I Want to do one of the things that the value that icy and you know half the states planning council is that you have this interaction camaraderie with individuals like yourself from just a different disciplines but all with a common theme of states whining so it gives you a different viewpoints on items to consider\nSo let's talk about this exciting event that's going to be happening this next week on Wednesday night October tenth it's October tenth right at the El Paso club um it starts at eleven thirty and it's\nWe're bringing in a speaker a professor Jerry buyer from Texas Tech he's an expert\nUm what do you know about him has says\nSo what I understand is a doctor by or is it very well recognized is he's both Texas and nationally recognized a expert in state planning and what is interesting also is that he has a blog that is recognized a asked one of the best in issues regarding estate planning\nAnd he's going to be talking about cyber estate planning\nThe ministry and so for those of you out there that may not exactly know what we're talking about it's about passwords and use their names and have you had any experience in your practice with people having trouble after a while there the executor trying to get into their username and password\nYeah I think that's an that's an issue that that really I think is very timely because I I Do have had a ... or I have had experiences where uh they don't know exactly how to act as many of these things and as you or many of these Web sites\nBut I think as you may know it it's kind of an uncharted world if you will I think for the for for the average person right\nWhere they don't know whether it's private information from an individual or if it's something that they would have access so I think something like this\nIs very timely for professionals in the fields and I think the for the average uh for the average investor\nAnd then also um from what I understand different companies like Facebook and Twitter and all those have different rules and I've even heard that once they find out that you have died they automatically turn it off and so the family loses all of that information that's there\nAnd so I'm for those of you listening it's going to be on Wednesday at the El Paso club at eleven thirty you can go to a P. E. P. C. dot org\nSlash events if you would like to come we would love to have you and will introduce to you a lot of new ideas on how to do a year estate planning and if you have any questions you can call his his down at Merrill Lynch what's the phone number over there\nNine when five five three for three one zero eight well\nThank you so much as soon as I look forward to working with you some more and being at the lunch in and hopefully we can all learn a lot so that we can give our clients and our customers great advice\nThanks very much Susan they were going to take a quick break right now and when we get back we'll talk a little bit more about some estate issues\nOver six one new today on the radio\nReading or just sending our children with labor in mind when you're\nWhen you're you bring all our Green Party whether you were in the city of new collections\nAnd never hurts small acts of kindness was great love in walnut me who you don't drive anymore is not necessarily a small thing donated to the national federation on the line just imagine the blessing your donation to me the other was easy to do just needs to be", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Crazy About Jewelry", "city": "El Paso", "day": "06"}
