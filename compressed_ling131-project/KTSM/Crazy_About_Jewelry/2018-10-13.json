... and you could send me a message that way so I'm always happy to answer your questions\nWell this last seven days has been an incredible opportunity for me to learn\nIt started out where I went to the gym a logical Institute of America symposium which was an event at the gym a logical Institute of America which is the most recognized and well known 'em\nA laboratory and school in the world which is where I went to school many years ago and they every four or five years have a symposium where they invite\nScientists and ... just from all over the world to come and make presentations\nAnd wall of this this was the first year that they had a two day seminar from\nThe Harvard Business school which I attended and I'll tell you that it was the most interesting and educational experience in two days that I have ever been out and we'll talk about that one day on the whole radio show so that I don't split it up\nAnd after that I came home and the next day was the El Paso estate planning council had an event called cyber estate planning and administration and if you remember last week I had a guest houses cost the nose for Merrill Lynch\nAnd he was a he's on the board with me I'm the vice president he's on the board and we were talking about estate planning and how important it is\nWell Dr Jerry buyer he talked about\nPasswords and user names and access to these things after you die and how important it is\nTo make to plan on these just like you plan for your house in your car and your savings then years things your jewelry your are your collection that anything that sentimental\nAnd search your passwords end user names and all those kinds of things and so we had a great turnout uh Jerry BYOR is a a special professor at Texas Tech in\nA state planning he told me that now he teaches a one semester and goes around and travels all over the second semester speaking a somewhat different every week about the subject\nIt's very much in demand he also has a blog where he talks about the state issues and that's the most well known and awarded blog legal blog in the United states and so it was super super interesting hearing about what he had to say\nAnd so I'm going to tell you a little bit about it because I think you can all benefit by what I learnt now I didn't bring my notes today but I Will bring them next time and in case there's anything I forgot to say I will say that\n[noise] so first of all you know these terms of agreement that every time you buy something or you apply for a credit card or you go online and uh\nBy either by something or or set up for username and password you know how they all say a terms of agreement and you know how all of us just click the box without reading them\nWell that is a huge big mistake\nAnd the reason it is he said is because if you read those things most of them say that when you die you are they have the right to turn you off\nThat means your passwords your user names your um any your social media your banking anything but we don't read those uh fortunately I have to say that I'm at fault also\nAnd right there is where it says\nThat um you they can turn you off completely well guess what if your family wants to go into\nYour pay pal and train ... money over or if you have crypto currency or something like that you cannot do it or you're breaking the law now there's a law out there and I believe he said it was in Texas too\nThat if you do that and you go in without permission that you are breaking the law theoretically you could be a [noise]\nYou you could be penalize for that [noise]\nBut then he said what happens is now some of the places are putting in their terms of agreement\nThat uh if you give permission and writing to someone\nThat they have the ability to allow or disallow it so just because you might put in your will that you give your executor off the right to all your username and password does it mean that it's legal for him to do that\nHe also mentioned that there might not be asked\nFree thing that you want your executives are your kids to see\nSo you really don't want to put a blanket every here's all my passwords go in and look at anything there might be private things there might be things that you don't want other people to see and so you have to be selective of\nWhat permissions you give and to whom when you're doing this in your state planning\nSo of course the first thing is to keep track now he said there are places online where you can put in all your username and password but again they have the right\nTo refuse to give them to you if they want and so he was telling us about cases where they had to spend a lot of money with lawyers they had to get court orders they had to sue the companies to get access and sometimes the companies who are much bigger than us\nGoogle and Facebook and all those people can still denied access to it\nSo it's definitely something to consider\nA we're working on an addendum to my book\nAbout inheritance issues about putting in a page about your username and password and if you've checked to be sure and also to remind you to put in your will who has access and to what not that that's perfect but it will help in case there's\nSomething and there could be resolution if you have that in writing not verbally\nNow some of the other um\nThings that he said is\nThat even bet banks and and federal places like that they know when you die because they can get death certificates\nThere are subscription services that they um\nSubscribe to that every time someone in your area dies they send it out and that way you can check and the same thing happens you have to see what you've signed as to if they have access now your estate planning lawyer can help you with that in Texas of course is\nState regulated in most cases but he was saying that\nSome of the password laws are federal so you would need federal federal attorneys someone that those those statues and someone that knows Texas state if you're in Texas\nNow there's been so many different kinds of reaches with hacking and things like that and so you would be surprised at how many passwords that you have you know we sit there and we every time we want something new and it asks us for one if you think you're going to go back you put it in\nNow hopefully you're writing them down but you need to put the date that you that you set it up because sometimes you change it\nAnd if it was ten years ago and the person tries to get in and it doesn't work then they'll know that either they required that you change it or you changed it and you didn't write down what the new one was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Crazy About Jewelry", "city": "El Paso", "day": "13"}
