{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "Could be seeing things from the other side sometimes\nYou know and and sometimes not and and negative spirits attack people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems or depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that\nUsually what happens is is not so much of an immediate dug but actually been working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work I'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know have looked at in a you know get some light medication for it\nBecause it ... the demonic Stewart had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be a physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark rooms that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and especially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side to being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is it possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to\nTo repent turtle I gotta go to the other side gets off\nDrugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing extra citizens in teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said when I say no I Am not the spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see her still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about while you steal things it's not my job\nYou don't have time to spare to\nThrow that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things and trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that any more than a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is going to he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy and the person who's energy field of the average person\nEverybody's a stir anything they just negative energy issues and also if there is some kind of negative spirit attack not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house or a night or apartment to apartment or condo to condo or up to pop whatever and get out of there\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual is hey this is my main concern not are dealing with a negative or is\nThere you don't just to walk the streets of gold actually it was one of the things they do what's worked for higher spirits and help others look at themselves as doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get rid of them\nGeorge I um I was born with it at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing if it's you know I'm\nA mom for that get you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to all this kind of stop at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started not fifty nine hours started to remember doing it's kind of things and half life helping people that to me is the greatest if I could ever be giving is the ability to help people\nIt's dangerous work but the idea that wants to teach people how to protect themselves and not be so susceptible it can go to work and not come so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they they love it\nYou know it's just great here than say thanks Jeffrey but you know the real or is feeling better that's what it's all about it\nSure is Jeffrey you bought your website would you please ... you can find everything

now I look back at this week in history\nThis week in Nineteen thirty six harnessing the power of the mighty Colorado River the Hoover Dam begin sending electricity over transmission lines spending two hundred and sixty six miles of mountains and gathered around the lights radios and skills of Los Angeles\nThis week in Nineteen fifty six New York Yankees right hander Don Larsen which is the first no hitter in the history in the world series even better than it was a perfect game and that is there a new runs no heads and no ... no batters reach first may Larson performance anchor steam third string land against their cross town rival the Brooklyn Dodgers\nIs weak in Nineteen Ninety two Eighteen year old Michele nap is watching television and our parents living room and skill New York and what you hear the thunder is crashed in the driveway she went outside to find a sizable hole in the rear end of her car a matching hole in the gravel driveway underneath the car and in the hall bowling ball sized media writing\nMedia rights are fairly common and media right hitting a car is not in the car is after all very small object on a very large planet in fact as far as scientists now it is only happen twice before once in Illinois during the Nineteen thirties and one's in St Louis and this week in Nineteen Ninety eight in the U.S house of representatives\nVotes to proceed towards him beating President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice\nBy December Nineteen Ninety eight the Republican led house had gathered enough information from an investigation committee to vote in favor of impeachment which in turn sent the case of the Senate Bill Clinton was the first president to be impeached by the house of representatives Andrew Johnson in Eighteen sixty eight Johnson was the last ... last year to look back at as we can history you\n\n\n\n\nSee news radio I'm deem you to President Trump says he'll be speaking to the king of Saudi Arabia about the disappearance of Washington Post columnist you mall 'cause show gene\nIs potentially a really really terrible situation so we'll see what Trump's\nAnd that's why\nWe're fully oh starts to fall apart little by little dot com start to fall apart all of a sudden that Fifteen million dollar Brazil shows\nEight million and again please get out please don't their possessed by the account statement represents they think oh they had they think that they had sixteen million or fifty million and it's going to go back there what do you think happened to all of those ...\nThey lost all\nThey lost it all because they didn't use her head\nIt's a lot about the ... people unfortunately just don't really seem to get to understand when you have um market corrections market corrections and show off what do you think the mainstream media does\nIt go in a little little folder on a desktop there and they pulled down stock photography of Wall Street people grabbing their heads and looking distraught\nAnd they put them everywhere and then when you have a major\nSo off at a certain sector they get the um they they pull out the story like clockwork\nIt's like it's ready to go they just plug into names and numbers\nBut you know the five hundred wealthiest people in the world last Ninety nine billion dollars on Wednesday\nThey what\nThey lost Ninety nine billion dollars huh it\nWhat was the one was it was they said just these those last what was it six point one billion dollars on when I think that was the number\nThat we did the jet these shows have six billion dollar bills in his wallet and one hundred million dollar bill and he lost his wallet somewhere and he lost six point one billion dollars\nOh he owns stock in a company and\nThe value of the company went down on that day do you think Jeff Bezos is now going to say honey honey you know we're we're going to go out to dinner too that you know you know fancy restaurant tonight when I was six point one billion dollars today so we're going to go to pull the instead\n[laughter]\nFine they're all okay\nNo I I should explain this I Do a little bit this past week on this as well but I think it's a good time explaining again um you you have ownership and accomplish\nThe valuations fluctuate all the time for example if you have these those today wanted a cash out on six point one billion dollars in stock\nAnd he calls up is is is Buddy Guy and said listen I Need a cash in on six point one million dollars in stock the stock is trading at this so this amount of shares\nDo you think that you you know his traders has got to go out there and be able to sell that amount of shares and get that money back or do you think\n\nWhat you should think is that hey you know what he's going to flood the market with that amount of shares what's it going to do it's going to drop the price of the stock the stock\nIs not a window at a casino when you're done for the day and you bring your chipped shop and they cashed out okay especially especially when you have the that the amount of shares that these guys have that just can't go up there and sell it all\nIt would crush the stock you have to find a buyer and you put a price that's out there that is quoted there's a bit and there's and ask and when you hit that\nIt's only good for a certain amount of shares didn't apply starts coming down it's the supply and demand market as well\nYour stock I don't care how liquid it is\nIs worse what somebody's willing to pay for and if you're a guy like measles or a guy like Tim Cook her stomach mark soccer bargain you got billions of dollars worth of shares what you think you could just go out there and sell 'em all without question the stock of course not\nSo all of those stupid articles out there about what so and so last are just that stupid\n\nAnd they're designed for a purpose to keep people in the dark Donald Luskin coined the phrase back in the Nineteen nineties the conspiracy to keep people who were and stupid\nAnd it's good for them it's good\nBecause without fail without fail every single time there's a stock market correction and a stock takes it there's gonna be a story out there about how much I certain CEO lost that day\nAnd you should laugh you really should\nYou can't even take these various different publications and it was a Bloomberg I read that one can take them seriously anymore they're parity their job and how they report on this stop looking out for you\n\nLike most of the mainstream media when it comes to reporting on financial issues there are there to confuse envy wills are you or if you tuned in so they can sell more ads\nDon't be suck and it\nTakes a quick break right here or to get back um I started off talking about I got to talk about that
