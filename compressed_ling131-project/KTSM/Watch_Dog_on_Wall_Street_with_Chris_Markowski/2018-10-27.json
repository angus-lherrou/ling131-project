{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSM", "content": "And that was I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't ... there'll be like zombies there'll be like and it's like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education piece in and I think that's where a great science writing in science journalism in a book like this is really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated\nThese issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have to be well informed in order to have a sense right Kenya right after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this may be totally irrelevant right because\nBy that time the beds and you're going to have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me get to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into I D I F ... when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into\nOur sense then ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking about the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be yeah I Will\nYeah but yeah I don't give a little plug up [laughter] I think you you were\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality\nAnd when the wrath of God is or out of a finance high and it says that they will pray that they would die and they were not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking where we've achieved immortality\nThis is this is an interesting premise again is whether immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray ... what's your thought on that Michael\nWell it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a\nSerious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse are some hint as to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jive\nWith what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating\nEr and and so I I I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of a ... of a mental a question or\nA mental experiments that people talk about a lot ... it will reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex\nAnd so beyond the you know hasn't existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it\nYou know it's like the guy in it running it's like running\nOn on energy that it absorbs from the environment I\nMean that's the word from saying or for the crush souls of the people in stumps on on you know when you get some coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right after you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop\nStop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know\nA ... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Kenmore elite dishwasher thinks so I'm not going to do those exactly where I'm living and by the way\nThey do is somebody with the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say it's really interesting\nThe Bible and the the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal\nOn the subject of immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolved with them so keep that in my let me go to a let me go to a gay man who is in Arizona on coast to coast they are David\nYeah hey my question for example and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\n\nUm why would be if\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing that gives it sounds like a really good\nQuestion yeah you just leave them and we just lost\nA Well James is in a in a Washington Let's try him while we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI uh enjoy your show but a man I Can't even machine going on forty five years yes or no\nOr macular

hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\n... what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine as\nThe years on dialysis is on kidney stones ... macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think where are the technology really is very helpful\nUm they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people's site with macular degeneration I'd actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though our site is still not crystal clear she can she can make out shapes and it's given or an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides are already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about that or is already working on a second\nGeneration a that will help actually restore sight the people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney front I don't think we need to create these same era\nOr there's a lot of great research and I've reported on off for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cells are ... create a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more ... of the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very hopeful\nAnd that's where we'll have to end with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for
