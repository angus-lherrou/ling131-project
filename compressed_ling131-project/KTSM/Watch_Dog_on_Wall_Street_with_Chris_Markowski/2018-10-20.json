Bush draw Iraq Iran North Korea back the legal now your book is very evil but we are the ones perpetrate evil around the world where the weapons of destruction everywhere even theory or\n... or ... did not do one you ever go to ... people year we're still lives there and that he did for work through all these bombs were\n[noise] yeah well I sort of question there Richard it it is it is perspective um you know I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly\nWhere they killed millions a hundred mile in China where they killed millions a and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the types of values that they support ah yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we've made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like uh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own\nOn a trip so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is [noise]\nUh we don't have any friends which is of interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself under prosper\nUm sometimes are in the eyes of holder it's evil or certainly in my perspective on either of you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I look at their history and I look for the one today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States is not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world I I tend to want to respect and a cure for our interests over there's\nParticularly because you know people talk about democracy or an and how that is really what protects [noise] freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization which you look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept off the street in the middle of the night and executed\nFor for no reason in most places in the world\nAnd to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims are incarcerated in was\nIn a western China today and that's a un report or somebody look it up here\nIn the last week or so or why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong and weaving knowledge that\nWe do bad things but the rest of the world you know I have\nI've gone through I think five sports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places are and\nYet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to United States are where we\nEnjoy the rule of law and we are in a phrase Richard's points out being arrested him pulled out of bed and shot him they had 'em for families being carted away and yet ah unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nYou know the likes of the Chinese are doing some of that for their own people and for the um\nThe guy to jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with an\nAlliance of evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold
