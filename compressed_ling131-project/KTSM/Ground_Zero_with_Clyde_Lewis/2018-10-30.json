he was with new funding in Nebraska and he said something the effect that perhaps the aliens that have been released dinner or mutilated cattle are probably tied to the column delete\nWell I mean well yeah but not in like a ritual they stick by or anything like that\nOr how would they tied up what what the caller insulate tight to\nYeah what what what was exactly the story with you and ...\nWell basically what it was a back in two thousand is seven I'm\nAlways looking for a new idea for a book and I thought about doing well on on the rental ... forest UFO landing case in England in Nineteen eighty and the reason why I thought about doing it was you know I mean that in a number of books that they ... on the subjects already but there was some interesting threads and late suggesting\nThat it ... like almost like an ... type things sort of testing new technologies on the on the military personnel on the base rather than a rail UFO London\nAnd he said that right by Shea um who is I'm a former Nebraska and a direct ... and also appraised so yeah you know it's sort of a unique back right when you get to you and ate backgrounds was a founding director and the other one is a priest\nAnd I spoke to write ... seven and he said yeah you know we kind of a chess and in the end they feel like if I have to read and stuff\nAnd I thought about doing the book on it\nBut women get on the phone he said well listen even more interesting story and might be interested in in so intrigued about it and that which we all make it better story I said well let's face and he said that\nThe guys in the government in the departments of defense who told him that the rental shack case was basically like a fabrication is holograms and mind altering technologies and whatever [noise] um he said that they were actually part of the program that was trying to or is it was sort of looking into the angle\nOf the UFO phenomena and things demonic rather than ... than they and so basically he told me the story of how he met two representatives\nOf this particular group um and and that for a number of decades things quiet lay and carefully\nInvestigating the whole issue of the UFO phenomenon and trying to put threats together um to as the ice or at least um to confess I'm the idea that this was demonic you want to say I confess I'm\nThat lives with pretty much light up they would pay for their open minded they were absolutely sure that's what rights\nSee I was I was under the impression that were re was saying oh they were saying they were trying to tie the aliens to um uh the demons or the demonic ah ah the demonic personalities ... these but they classify them as non human entity right in my ... year old\nAnd a non human entities but they fully believe they were literally damons from electro al ... and um they the story was that they ... said he went back a number of decades\nAnd so I was sort of like an agency like the ... the CIA which actually had like a head coaches they didn't even have a head cold says um that were like a think tank that would get together for three or four times a year at meetings\nAnd to try and figure out the latest developments and then they were ... or ... reports that were ... they influential pay fleeing governments like in the day a day and some of the intelligence agencies and to\nTo basically say they see the light estates or that
