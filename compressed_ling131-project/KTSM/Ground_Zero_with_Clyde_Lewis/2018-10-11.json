Richards in key Largo Florida or when you think of the keys you think of you know hurricane activity as well but uh not right now this is a the panhandle Richard you're on Schmidt welcome to the program\nAnd how you doing man just started going at\nAll I Want to preface has a couple of things are phone engineer I live in key Largo I'm a contractor\nI went through Hurricane Andrew several years ago which was a category ... storm\nRight in our cat I've actually it was a category ... that was one of the Florida yeah August in Nineteen Ninety two west\nOf pumps that air base which was ground zero or anybody that stays in one of these things and I mean we build up pretty significantly down here to to accommodate the the when that\nWe get we we're we're we're very frequented by by her and um unfortunately nobody else in the country builds the way we\nUm we use all concrete walls a matter of fact that's how I built was the concrete roof as well um and I feel badly for anybody that would have stayed in this area I Know they're going through right now I've seen it a a witness it myself this is a bad storm anybody that's in a what\nA wood frame building or art or for God's sake to a trailer or they're done with this thing is a bad storm\nYeah the only thing that we can hope for now is that uh most importantly that the loss of life is meal or minimal or hopefully none\nBut with a category for a strong learned that almost a category five\nAh luckily hitting a little less of a populated area but again the breath the width of this storm is so large I'm just hoping that the injury and death toll is extremely low but I I understand what you say about structures you know as a Florida resident myself you know I've been in Florida since Nineteen Ninety two\nAnd I built a ground up house beginning in two thousand three it took us a little over two years to build the house but I built a house a all concrete and steel\nI even poured a a second floor I've got a four inch ah you know porn deck a ... commercial construction on my house and I put in all Miami Dade hurricane windows the weakest point is you know do the weakest is the roof and that's always you know my concern is uh the roof\nI\nAgree with you I'm In the way we are way we handle it down here is ... ... were built to um they cheat a hundred and Seventy or Maulana by\nOn our wind shear with whatever we built here in South Florida I'm In um the way we do that with the U.S through British is um is that we we use Sanibel straps everywhere and and obviously the trust is er beefed up\nWe don't use it to buy or trust we use it leads to to buy six\nAnd in most cases it to buy six or to attend trust right and they're offering us it it is they're very strong\nRichard I'm I'm up against the clock here in the hour and a it sounds like you know where you're talking about I own a higher unified build again or my concern I've got a claim barrel rules you know the the natural clay

hour and always on line and if\nYou assume radio dot com news radio six Ninety is Kate GSM am El Paso [noise]\nIn the news radio I'm Brian Chuck hurricane Michael is now a category one storm but it's currently slamming Georgia with heavy rain and sustained winds of Ninety miles per hour and MSNBC's Tammy lighter reports from Albany\nThings have changed in the last hour they picked up dramatically so when the rain you can tell there is nobody out on the street right now everybody is at its hunker down at this point\nAll kinds of cool things but yeah I I don't know big covered though that Reagan was the president of the told us be ready for extraterrestrial because if we ever find ourselves in a situation where the entire world's at odds with one another you will always be that alien threat\nThat would unite us and that's and that's the thing is that so we're we're meeting now I think we need that alien throughout the Reagan talked about um maybe even uh what was it a Jimmy Kimmel Bill Clinton said the same thing but\nYou know you said like he's a guy who did it and I only employing or something to\nBring us together and you know the ... the ... the president's talking about alien threats you know it's so easy thing\nReally to search for signs of intelligent life beyond our solar system\nI'm\nIn addition to the incredible distances involved\nAnd the fact that\nReally only have indirect methods at our disposal to look for us to trust your life and we have people who say they woke up and they see the stars and they they see the the flashing lights in the sky or they see UFOs during the daytime which by the way there seems to be this inordinate amount of UFOs sightings there was actually is\nI think on the east coast um some ... in the Carolinas before the earthquake and not the before the before hurricane Michael hit to the Gulf apparently it's going to get into the the the Carolinas Carolina's having some really harsh weather since um\nSince Florence and and so now Michael May give them a little taste of some more water and more more rain but that doesn't mean that after the hurricanes they didn't see UFOs and apparently I I someone sent me footage I'm\nFrom ah Myrtle Beach actually someone saying that a UFO aside over Myrtle Beach and they said was just what the black he was talking about\nAnd um I really in Cedar UFO myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see the ... so I saw whites but I don't know\nThat we could call that something that's outer space but you know I guess if the person you know when they saw heard the black to show said well you know you hear the UFO it's supposed to be seen and that was what Carol David Davis was saying\nIt would be a UFO that would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time\nSo I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know it's like I told somebody has to sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right you know the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know unless you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like you said a lot of integrate indirect methods to contact or at least try to find a\nScience intelligent life in ... I mean there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to the researchers and writers scientists are going well we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological lives they're arguing over small cell organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or\nYou know other um ice planet ... icy moons like hop in Star Wars intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien well how are they going to communicate with us I mean I'm would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology communicate I'm probably not and will be will say well\nThey shouldn't be advanced enough to know our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language of misconstrued is being not as smart and that that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know as a young kid and I was like you know\nI was learning a language but I forgot that you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpreted that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can forms they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smart or whether or not being an underwear model major stupid and they were comparing Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no money from stupid and wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages they're really smart and they're very well do you keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy when producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks Mandarin Chinese I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and Mandarin will be the language big business because we all know the future and we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know border things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that's that's important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing\nYou know communicating with daily and so that's a bigger deal\nDoing if we were you in language of the of of other people's ear on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks ... I'm a you know made up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up but you can still be going on in Esperanto\nBut ah using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of communicating\nAnd so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now\nI mean it used to be well we want proof of aliens have arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Saturday and many\nOf course the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and many messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international\nThese groups are don't care if ... plan on the White House they want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they want to be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me I'm I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about a few nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up and this guy seeing whatever\nIt is out there keeping your mind open looking for extraterrestrials in space\nOr looking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um\nThere was a a huge media I guess the crash in a place called ...

brought this up we used it to reduce\nWe'd blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blew they did reduce over the air so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send the huge orange down this ancient sound\nBut I'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on\nJust last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county up you were telling you about it or we just got tired and Jeremiah calling the program the laughs are seeing the day so that was the only guy to report it and they saw me wonder if anybody else thought\nAnd apparently it had an impact little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clue stuff and for more advanced um you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these take the signatures\nWell\nI also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that uh that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures it'd be human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the singles affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extraterrestrial signals that we can't even perceive\nOr do you even know about unless someone else hears them and basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the end so city and Betty\nThe guys that runs city and Betty spend a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on the sound at the moment they you know because it buried it actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise but uh\nLike I said some people were already hearing his pulsing sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where a mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound is a constant pulsing home but according to witnesses laughed at forty five minutes to an hour\nA there was there's a film on the Internet going viral right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you living out there are a bunch of guys on a on a\nSnowmobiles and they come by occasionally but what you hear is just a really low frequency home and here's that sound this is from a northern Switzerland or a man by the name of Renee ... Pinsky\nHad a record of this back in December after snowfall just recently got the attention of a paranormal investigator sitting here is that home\nNo that's not the hummus try another ... it's a wait a minute [laughter] here's behind that was from Utah here's another um\n[noise]\n\nShow this was filmed by a man named Renee ... Pinsky back in December mysterious humming noise that day he picked up on he said that uh it was rattling the house she said that it was a like it was rattling the sky\nOr very missed it by he said he was like something was moving from one end of the sky to the other big could not figure out what it was it was like so many visible thing will be across the sky was rumbling a sonics out in\nAugust so it was a report of another home near ... proving grounds which of course Doug way proving ground some people say is the northern arm of area fifty one it's in Utah I've been there\nIt has a lot of ah gates in danger science don't go in there and uh so here's that sound of the home it Doug way which is a little bit more aggravating to hear but here it is\n[noise]\n\n\nKnow earlier I had talked about how a sound like these the humming sweet and in the ... in ah Utah Doug way reminded me of a well known a recording of police officers in Saint Helen's Oregon\nUh they said they saw white a bright light on the Columbia River at four thirty in the morning or for twenty three in the morning\nAnd they wanted to be able to record the sound of this ship the spaceship as it was taking off from the Columbia and I wanted to play that moment against you can hear how it compares to the other sounds you've heard so here's that recording the police officers recording to take off his UFO\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] so you have it it's a sea Helens Oregon police officers\nWatching a UFO take off from the Columbia king up their microphone on the radio so you can hear your the home here the sound and this is why you know these sonic sounds or whatever they may be\nA these strange noises that were picking up on in the skies it's not just the orange anymore these homes these lower ... sees a piece of pulsating homes now these could be experimental aircraft\nBut then again they could be as I've said before some sort of techno ... signature technological signature from extraterrestrials okay\n[noise] some extraterrestrial intelligence [noise] sending pulse it [noise] and the setting them through space or the setting them through the skies and were picking up on [noise] and ah [noise] we don't know what kind of effect it has on people's ... certainly amazing [noise]\nSee here's what speech crafted their craft sound micro what's he sounded like when we play the [noise] so uh I mean if you've heard them and you've written off as a as the night as I'd like to talk with you wouldn't let you and ask you though actually where you've heard them because there's wealth [noise]\nThere's also possibly the aliens we'd be trying to connect us or contact despite some other means I'm going to talk about bad as well triple each accent mistreat thirty seven hundred [noise]\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listed in ground zero and we'll be right\nYou're listening to news radio six Ninety Katie as Sam [noise]\nHis online banks for closing on how they even have documents that I signed for home equity loan only I didn't let them nightmare\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud ... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your home like this police officer\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy two James Brown alienates much of his audience by meeting with President Richard Nixon in the White House and the doors to him in his bid for reelection this week in Nineteen Seventy six one hit wonder is Walter Murphy in the big apple ban went to number one on the U.S singles charged with a fifth\nOf Beethoven a mash up of disco and classical music\nThis week in Nineteen eighty one during a North American tour the Rolling Stones played the first two nights at the Los Angeles memorial coliseum in Los Angeles the opening act was prince who drafted is controversial bikini breach the trench coat ran off the stage after Fifteen minutes do the crowd doing and throwing beer cans at him\nThis week in Nineteen Ninety three Nirvana entered the U.S album charted number one in utero starts third and final studio album Kurt Cobain had originally wanted to name the album I hate myself and I want to die and this week in twenty sixteen rod Stewart is now I did at Buckingham Palace\nBecoming ... rod Stewart's biggest hit\nNineteen Seventy six tonight tonight number one\n\nYears or look back at\nMean no word in English language is less convincing them probably [noise]\nAre you sure we should get matching tattoos on her ... and ... probably ... probably [noise]\nMinutes by eight I can probably swim\nOr you should wait thirty minute let me tell me what to do it\n[noise] [noise]\n...

that's going to occur when in Tennessee I grew in your ground zero\n[laughter] Hi Hi I'm\nI'm I found this topic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the train because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun\nRight during my research I found out they were getting neutrino from a number of sources\nAre ablaze or large metallic cloud of ... and and the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight ... and and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried\nSo very very deep in the ground and they have the extremely large\nOr what where are you where it came to my attention is this has been an article where are you know at the polls a media writes in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's common place to find things that just fall who stay\nIn in that and touched rich in the ... of our planet right um so you know it came to my er my attention that what if while they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground\nSo large that they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been style you know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWell see that's the way you know it might be if y'all out from from whatever they may have\nFiled we're building this detectors or the question is you know where each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera see right not son particles\nHe's earned ... these aren't these are not neutrinos from the sun is not neutrinos from perhaps the quasars something else these are neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is is is somebody that doesn't belong on this planet\nIs being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular through our planet and they were finally they're detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know that that that's\nThat's a that's all right out and to make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the drummer particle right\nAnd ... and you know if it is really concerns me 'cause we're you know the fate is detectors have to be buried deep underground in meal with a water\nAnd in in order to you know to detect neutrinos that\nLarge numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right have they hit a ...\nA a heavy water molecule right and what winning it said he'd be water molecule it creates a splash that that the detector to protect and that's how they detected

literally\nYeah like the movie yes they are on the thing is in there and it\nDidn't and and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring
