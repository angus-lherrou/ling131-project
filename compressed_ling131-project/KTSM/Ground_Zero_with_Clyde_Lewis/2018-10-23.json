I think is different in that okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flight with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of a sudden has never been talked about on coast to coast day I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths\nGave the movie the mist remember the missed it was a it was a ... veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that you know that some quantum joke science can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet where the veil is thinner or\nThere's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred parallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to me the most powerful due to their position and the the appropriate ritual perform there by the writer fish it could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nIt could open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned that there are wormholes\nReporters that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like\nCERN and it was real into these can pass through and hot mankind and change the direction of the future and as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead arrowhead project\nAnd\nThe whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped a small town and during the night\nLarge insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pass eventually these creatures attack humans as well those horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great widow wars and they can only be described as deadly spider\nLike predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like cloth and flesh\nAnd in both the book in the film\nGreat widower is simply killed their prey with their acidic ... put it in the film\n\nThey also had the ability to capture and lay off hundreds of eggs\nIn the living human host\nThe eggs take about a data hatch and they multiply quickly now\nThe looks of these creatures were terrifying and there were even some that were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know that are done Toro did this show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is\nGets to be the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie and then they said we based many of the creatures\nOn supposed a second genesis creatures that were proposed by science\nThere were based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals made of flesh and blood nothing's supernatural about them okay but they are from\nA second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about\nWith regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study journey rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave which is the Canadian companies selling machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of hindered systems work hindered AI which is to sell the start up your founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated the whole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old one spoken of\nBy horror author H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty in like creatures they come through\nSounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis took place and and I mean I played the the the Ted talked before we talks about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it\nBut he says something effect he says well when I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we're going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say way smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of a worm with people right I mean\nUN must says you know if you're playing with a guy you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon little guy with a pen a gram you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to weigh about it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo you're coughing this attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature so opening up the wormhole letting these creatures through a very very very terrifying prospect and it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing it\nWay and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when\nWe see it it's each each just too much\n... have you seen anything like that [noise] I mean have you seen something I mean look I'm not asking you to tell me about something that's the supernatural I'm Talking about real monsters here I'm Talking about things that you've
