uncomfortable way of somehow believing that they are the reality police can always be do explain for those who believe in what they feel is nonsense really delusional it's in Brazil like it's more on it\nAnd so the Halloween season\nWe're almost there orbiter now I'm I'm getting at Halloween feeling uh the reason why I'm getting the Halloween feelings today for the first\nTime I actually felt a show\nBecause when I got up this morning there was so foggy everywhere and it was cooler than it usually is\nAnd you know I got to stop wearing my sandals means I got to start putting on shoes all summer long and I were the battles I wore the around the world because it's comfortable wear sandals you're not used to be the cool guy on the street just were slippers I got the idea from watching Bing Crosby it\nNow David Bowie singing Christmas [laughter] together that I wanted his worst slippers\n\nTo slip on these flip on slippers and aware of them everywhere you look so casual and your slippers like oh no I don't want to take 'em off\nMy feet to be nice and warm and my slippers\nBut today I actually started thinking when you don't have to wear my heated socks and shoes and I saw pumpkins at the store that where I went and got coffee this morning out of the cup of coffee or pumpkins or they're perfect shape pumpkins\nAnd the guy who got a start carving the pumpkins get out the candles put out the the skeletons it's time for Halloween\nBut see what you're doing Halloween and you're thinking about all of a scary Halloween stuff you know you get those emails while you're talking about that stopped far it's scary it's called Jesus doesn't like it well I you know what yeah it's a challenge to me it's a challenge to your mind as a challenge to everything because\nThis is a time Halloween Halloween is the time we open our minds the cult\nOf what I mean he has literally all things that are hidden you know that's what he called me is that all the cold I don't want to join in a cult that's no no no it's not what it called means well you're part of in a cold aren't you know that's not what a cult means a cult actually means that\nWhich is hidden mysteries\nThe mysteries of the world or the cold so diving into mysteries diving into the hidden diving into those things that are taboo a cold is one of those magical words\nThat can scare people enough to have them hide in their closets or under their beds\nOr provokes the reaction of intriguing certainly something where most people want to get in on the secrets and find out what big things are being planned in the shadows\nWhat we're talking about as we're talking about real honest to goodness magic\nNow you can still magic and aid G. I. C. right the regular is about or you can ... like the coldest do M. A. G. I. K.\nYeah and if you saw that way than you know that's pretty evil that says he will as you get right are\nYou still magic with a K. so um it's uh it's pretty amazing some of the things that are you know when you're in conspiracy circles there's those thoughts that you need to connect and when you do you start digging deeper and you know\nHalloween covers a lot of things but digging deep all the time see for me every day's April Fool's day and every night is Halloween so it's I'm connecting those dots\nAnd I get into\nThe great can spiritual the conspiratorial orders the dark orders that have all their secrets it's about who's in charge of the planet\nAnd who are the magicians that run the ... or the center you know there are theories about dark Brotherhood's receive their information about channeling the power of demons and there are other investigators that have shown that for millennia mankind has been directed by over towards that can only be compared\nTo I don't know divine or perhaps profane beings\nSome even believe are being controlled by extraterrestrial I mean we're not a point in time\nWhere so many weird things are going on that you have to in good conscience weighing possibilities inevitability is get it seems to be a never ending paradox the world at the moment seems unreal as we now understand\nThat uncertainty is a certainty and the change can cause great upheavals that can affect us for years\nOr even lifetimes\nYou've heard the old saying in magic as above so below something we should be remembered that even if our\nWorld is ... is decided to adhere to all kinds of crazy stuff there's a lot of crazy stuff signs and wonders in the sky and they continue to be here to the average Joe and there's always a number of it as secrets that are being revealed by religious orders and others that are being put on the back burner and of course all we hear about\nIs how there is a world order and that world order is going to be led by anointed elders anointed magicians and annoyed it's a sort of looked at Sherman right I mean this is what a monarchy is true\nThe monarchies are run by kings and queens\nIn kings and queens or annoyed ones they think that their bloodline goes all the way back to Jesus Christ\nOr you can go all the way back to God and we all know that blasphemy right but yet we still give honor to kings and queens\nThe cause I think if you go to the queen of England and you'll get all the families that bloodlines and with the bloodlines mean and it's just so strange that were so fascinated with blood and blood line\nMakes you wonder of empires or or you know if there's some sort of a a van pure Rick type order\nAnd that certainly uses all kinds of powers the power in the magic and the blood the power the magic of conscience\nThe consciousness and the so this is why it's so important to realize that now is the time where the consciousness is being analyzed because they know that there is a spark a divine spark found in the consciousness and they can use the consciousness as a way to perform acts\nOf alchemy seriously\nIt's all about being magical it's all about the magic that you can call it whatever you want drawing from the dark powers\nSome people drop from the lighter powers some people claim they have a priesthood\nOur priesthood it's similar to magic except they officiate saying that they have the power through oh I don't know God maybe or Jesus Christ or\nSome people call down the power of the angels but then there are other darker powers darker priesthood and representations of his dark appreciates that are being practice now see it used to be the satanism never was\nSerious satanism just a bunch of people who are but [noise]\nFashion victims who go to the goodwill and we're all

on the on the show before he lives in Ireland he's amazing we've had him on the show to comment on all things called openings bizarre and I think it's really a pleasure in ... it's an awesome opportunity\nFor us to kick off this season to talk with Thomas about his new book about some of the things that are changing uh within the scope of spirituality mainly leaning towards the cult spirituality Thomas shirt as an author artist and filmmakers from Dublin\nA dumb in Ireland you came to international a recognition twenty eleven with the book\nPuzzling people the labyrinth of a psychopath years since he's written several more books that has made films on topics such as social engineering political and corporate pathology and on the called ... surrounding the emerging years of the third Reich in recent times his work\nIn the ancient mysteries and sacred a location has been featured in some of the world's largest media outlets and he's a highly sought after public speaker around the world we have him tonight Thomas shared in welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to be able to have you in such a time I mean\nAs I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will they brought these ideas for for all\nKinds of reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs there's a sense of that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind\nCabinet is it a papal look at things like you know\nQuantum physics in these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey want to let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is you know is the five cents reality is that Malia bill is it\nKind of change it cannot alter towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to us for that reason as well I think also there's a there's a kind of the maturing going off the mall and that it's almost living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions and the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves with these guys are on the polling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt is evil really considering the source it's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night with Chris geo injury geo we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the downplaying character meaning that it's a symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't it interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple self like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a top a or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI been taking a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... the the way these people have been using them ethics for a few years now and we are in a different world there's a basically a a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like means to actually mold reality in terms of the political structure and that is ... ... is ... is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very ... and frightening and deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like a\nCultural relaxes repeaters or whether you want to call them and they're they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing special about them is that they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh the humanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and saying look at what you're saying is that what you're doing look at what you're acting upon\nAnd it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been ... characters\nThat have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered a that was actually created that are probably a a created the among kill us but he had a ... uh the uh the one uh that was called the way\nThat he had that looked like a huge balding kind of a self like character but it's just a simple thing it's a simple name is repeating or at least showing them this is the the mirror you're looking through this is looking through a glass darkly and it's making people uncomfortable\nAnd the simplicity of it as well it's nothing it's not like anything complex so it's almost like ad targeting the

well we were talking about earlier where\nThe pope apparently a was at a Senate and ah he pulled out the staff it was a very familiar staff to those who are pagan to those who are which is a staff has\nCalled the staying and a conservative Catholics were appalled\nAnd viewed the pope's choices staff as evidence of something scary something diabolical something which she was going on at the Vatican and so you know while most folks do use\nAh what is called the feral or a pastoral staff that uh has across the top um\nThis one was different this one uh looked is Thomas comment if it\nDoes is it it seems to be this staff that represents a the the nail support staff preserve the pope had a nail going through it and when you look at me iron nail in staying it symbolizes\nA lot of things uh Thomas\nWas saying that a ... that includes a fabulous and that it it basically unites the part in ... is the triple motif of a threefold serpent team to lurk Cain Nick\nUh and uh we were hearing earlier about this man or the called the first hour saying that his wife\nWas involved with some sort of a a serpent teen or women rising up against against the men or ... were rising up against

it's deep in the earth when you're talking about Canucks power that comes from Cain and so um\nWe have a Thomas Sharon back you know it seems to me that and this was said uh this has been said I Can't remember where I heard\nThat when Donald Trump was elected president\nAnd Hillary Clinton was not elected president the United states this basically jarred or at least\nA peak the rage of the feminine power and so the feminine power I had to regain a a place and so now they're fighting for that power again is this why you think or is this could be why a witchcraft now is is being a actually is

Thomas it was called security theater\n[noise] and what that term means is that really\nYou know we have to put trust in one another because the reality is is that our lives are fragile that we have fragile lived with ... the system collapsing all these things are are a possible their ...\nAnd the truth is is that everybody or gives us a sense of security and they create the security theater by you know having child proof tops TSA the airports that sort of thing\nI think the church uh especially the Catholic Church now I think they provide this provide us with a little spiritual security theater thinking that everything is in control\nBut then we have a pope who steps into the sitting odd holding is staying\nTrying to tell people about uh how he's going to eliminate the pedophilia

Robert of virtue what do you say about that what is that what kind of a sex magic is bad but it's going to destroy what we have here on this on this planet\nI think yeah I think the Catholic Church I looked at the fly on the wall\nRight now there is that you have this Pope Francis making a lot of strange statements about\nDo you know global is kind of ideas things that that sure traditionally were against and he's he's stuck promoting them it's almost like desperation tactics not quite recently here the the ... visited Ireland and it was a disaster and ... he was basically going around in his pope will be able to empty streets\nAnd that's because of all the clerical sex abuse is in some horrific things that are called the light in art and the ... very much if they're not they're not black magic that pretty much close to it conducted by members of the Catholic Church\nAnd often I'm just wondering if this was this whole thing with the dying if it's some kind of like it it just it it is symbolic\nOf a nervous breakdown within the Vatican but they're they're losing control you know after two thousand or Eighteen hundred years or whatever\nAnd I don't I think that that the Vatican is
