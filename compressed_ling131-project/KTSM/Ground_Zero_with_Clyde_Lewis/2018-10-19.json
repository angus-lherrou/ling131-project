halfway weekly religion they want to eat half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I've spoken to bore about how here we are\nTo ship this ... this is a a major\nA paradigm shift\nAnd we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\n\nAnd then later when you're a school on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is\nMy truth and you say\nWell it's not true if it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception and we know the selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we'd\nBe transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light\nLifelike love survival spirituality God you know [noise]\nAnd then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames\nCell phones many other things that you know that are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there in Atlanta compartmentalized area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory\nAnd we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however\nIt's emotion that is driving this guy since so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd the subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces was struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling at all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people responding\nTo the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending\nPropaganda they keep pushing and pushing and pushing see many people but if they have not had the the time nor the guest desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four ah by George Orwell\nUsually you know they say things that were big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they they know a few lines\nRight\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world where the government had corrupted the language forced the citizenry to\nBelieve lies as if there were truth and they were being tracked with a ubiquitous tell a screen that was basically extent in every home place of business and public facility today we are 'til the screens there attached to our hands\nThere aren't virtually every communication device they are the first thing we look at in the morning there the last thing we see at night\n\nThey are programming the masses with emails music and means and with every algorithm we're slowly being coerced into following anything that seems to be calling her confirmation\nBy so this process where not only beginning to wonder if someone is watching us we're also noticing that somebody is scripted us or is it Lee ... some people and acting like\nWhat are now being called non player characters the non player characters are and PCs or the newest me that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is I mean there are there are and the season games gamers do it in PCs are\nOkay a actual NBC's or computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses\nI'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's may assigned missions to a player like in skyrim\n\nThey joined the players a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\nIt is clearly I I think it's being used cleverly to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC me mocks left us and they make it it's basically the expressionless face this kind of like I'm\nA ... face a ... and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in for Chan and over the weekend twin responded by suspending more than Fifteen hundred accounts associated with the MP seem as they claim it violated the terms of service namely intentionally misleading election related content\nSeveral months ago unfortunate and read it the online you know where you go to look at messages on fortune read it they started using the term and PC to refer to liberals and these people said well they said that you know they joined the anti Trump crowd because they're sheep\nThey're brainwashed sheep that's what they believe in and they'd been conditioned a parrot left wing orthodoxy in the manner of scripted characters so when you look at one of these and PCs they're basically this crudely drawn great cartoon avatar has a pointy noses in a blank face\nAnd it's just like a stick figure face in fact if you remember back in Nineteen eighty four when apple had their little

word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with\nSo you were talking about numbers and number ... symbolism and a numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to ...\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge

just like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and the waiting as I Do that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy and I believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIs that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of them in and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic ways very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical

could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a split second and it and if\nThat's what makes them so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really do change people's minds in really quick
