mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me or you know one of the weirder aspects\nOf quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about and that's retro causality we're talking about causation that runs backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time Feinstein\nCame up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you'd be a radical explain or\nBring about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today Thanks to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as\nFor example you're in a bar or somewhere like ... ah like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says I Want to marry you\nAnd I want to marry you on this date so you set a date when the marriage is going to happen right you set a date for that and uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you shave your beer to you to get yourself a suit and tie and I want to house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know what's gonna happen\nYou just do there's a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so it'll be passed after you\nYou know after president goes away and continues and continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal okay\nSo you're you're preparing for something that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed\nIn in that way which is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not it's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect too what effect happens before the cars and that's something that's hard for science to grasp although\nA pair of physicist right now from the ... from a from the United states and Canada that actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measurements made to a particle could go back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much and we all know quantum mechanics is is weird right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level particles\nDon't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow is Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him long time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and Adams and and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about and we're talking about the blurry cloud in ... and and the blurry cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white ball sitting by balls in every pocket\nOkay we can have we can face forward okay well you see everything in front of us right at our feet but behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind us but we don't even if we take a look back\nWe see what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things are happening that we don't understand\nWhere we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about and maybe he's gay this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe in ...\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so\nHave you can prevent me just a minute\nMisrepresent these ... these clouds or maybe he's represents something\nVery real okay possibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean some some reason we're in that mindset where there's always hope for something to go better we should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if if this represents something real up all the particles\nAre like bouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what it wants in front of a sometimes with Kevin you see behind me be on her own feet\nSo\nThis is just a convenient representation of what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nAh [noise] it's beginning we're beginning to see that

been one of my topics to favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the past\nOr vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stop\nAnd I felt like that there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of brings the past the quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time I I I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean we're in the realm of fringe analytics or like say that it's better that conspiracy theory which is\nStart using that right were fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea rather than saying you're a conspiracy theorist you're a fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal unfair political\nBut uh in the realm of fringe analytics and and being a fringe or analyst there's a whole lot of maybe using coincidences that should never be ignored\nEven when they sound outrageous and so when I played that audio just now the broadcast the man on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he could have made a lucky guess right\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how would lead you down the roads\nThat take you to what it's called the further beyond\nSt modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time as it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise for structure of the future in some way\nIt is propose that through what is called revolution of the methods that were warned or were\nBeing prepared to accept certain ideas means er ideologies we see it in film and TV shows and many things that eventually come to pass but we see it like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attacks they even predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow\nPredict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time\nAnd at the convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's eyes science fiction has never gotten it right and I said I beg to differ man I said you write it you write science I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just

thought it was a hoax but what I Want to do was on a plane you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel would prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to it so I'm gonna play this for you again\nAnd ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guys do this this is the ... the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy so it's like I said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five here we go\nAnd get one welcome back in the program\nI can talk about a rather serious topic for the child today we are going to make some predictions maybe someday my back on such protections but yeah I Do know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now\nOnly twenty forty five it is never going to come out in the state of the world\nAnd one hundred and yes we have seen before the world has changed drastically and the last one hundred yes just one hundred years ago\nAnd the year ... fine the concept\nOf self power frying machine seemed as ridiculous an identity evidence to many that's great and ... has seen all changed in the fall came to mind as we go over our protections for the next one\nHundred years then one hundred years I put it that men will have stepped foot in front of all the celestial bodies such as the moon and the ... mosque in one hundred years I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety\nOf sources big companies\nWill no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy\nI sit in one hundred years cause one let alone can be constrained for the crown and we'll have the ability to fight and the average wealth and the energy that powers the cost will come from the sun and one\nIs the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller I predict the television and sent to the point that they can sit on our\n... yes that will be soon cameras at every street corner they won't be put in place in the name of a safety but our freedoms running increasingly vanish we want to create our freedom a safety we want to allow our rights to be around it because they all thought his tell us and we'll keep our\nChildren are safe now remember these are protections north say maybe some of the future man we're back on a good day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if they're productions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are a little off ... by just a a tad I think but\nWhen you're dealing with something called revelation of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that eventually come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality in real time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past future shaping the past time travel is a fantastical concept and most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that\nThe idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history yeah\nI don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter 'cause there'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know\nBut um it is possible or hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um\nThere are those who me for us have had in sight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction that time travel is possible and his happen from time to time or time after time or or timing for an item and and that's ... as you\nMay know like I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow land there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nAnd what I found most interesting is in the film or they discussed a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison at his power apartment just started a secret society of optimists plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity now key members of this group included\nPeople like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that\nCreated a breakaway civilization in another\nDimension okay so I Know science fiction writer but is there any truth to it that's the question well as we do is we dig deeper into this story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this is this is the story tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra\nNow the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called the super transport key VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra were given special VIP audio chores tours of the world's fair\nOr the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now Walt Disney had the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair\nThat believed to contain a portal tomorrow it\nIn reality does he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's called club thirty three it's a private club a club thirty three is not accessible to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol had an editor\nClubs thirty three I guess has to press a buzz buzz around an intercom it's concealed by hidden panel and a doorway\nAnd Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the de ... society and they sign a quarter and so a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry soap\nA fictional secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra I started wondering is there something like plus old truck that I can present for you tonight\nThat would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel\nYes I can do this and it it is ... ... as I was digging through this this ... plus ultra it's Latin for further beyond now I Need for you to remember those words plus ultra because\nThose are the two words that are going to be the ones that are going to unlock the doorway unlocked the key it's acute opens the door where the doors of perception of your mind to maybe have you thinking about where we are right now and whether or not\nThere are people in high places that can manipulate the future changing the passes or well said he controls the future controls the past well there may be\nA few people [noise] Mitt are these types of [noise] plus ultra people\nThey're actually [noise] using the future to correct things for the past or [noise] or using retro causality in order to do it on to the county [noise]\nIt'll blow your mind as to what I found and I'm sure you'll with his night I'm really excited so stay to Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six Seventy three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis you listen to ground zero and we'll be\n[noise]\n\nEl Paso news radio six Ninety Katie is that [noise]\n\nStamina to over the pirate this weekend Nineteen twenty the Indians Elmer Smith hit baseball's first world series grand slam\nHorn this week in Nineteen sixty one one of the greatest wide receivers in NFL history Jerry Rice is born in stark ville Mississippi\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy one is the world series first night game played in Pittsburgh where the pirates see the Orioles\nForty three [noise] this week in Nineteen Seventy nine Boston Celtics guard Chris sports scores the first three point basket an NBA history and the first quarter of a one fourteen one of six when versus the Houston Rockets at Boston Garden\nAt the game also marks the debut of Boston rookie Larry Bird [noise] this week in Nineteen eighty the Dallas Mavericks debut in the NBA with one oh three Ninety to victory against their interstate rival the San Antonio spurs every union arena\nAnd this week in twenty sixteen Toronto maple leafs working Nineteen year old often Matthews become the first player to score\nFor gold in his NHL day deal that you're hard radio weekends sports time capsule\nNo word in English language is less convincing them probably [noise]\nAre you sure we should get matching tattoos on her her ...

G. wells married Amy Catherine Robbins\nWho died in Nineteen twenty seven minutes as as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel\nAnd women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six well wells also claimed that he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish\nA future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order would happen but he knew that a new world order was in the works and he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order and the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or\nA utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a career Hispanic leader that led them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world would be brought into a new world order by criminals dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that that there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to\nCreate a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing and kind of like what Ben joined Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice\nAnd whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess I don't know if you ... ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla is also one\nOf the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine that he was be I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the\nTime well by the time of his death he had patented\n... about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll those possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property and about three weeks after they were seized all Tesla's things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump our president what's interesting is that\nYou know Jon Jeter Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually\nCreate X ray machines Tesla was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from a long line of intellectuals and very ah geniuses like my uncle John J. Trump or John ... Trump he was a genius as well\nWell um what's interesting about all this is is that\nThe question is what Donald Trump Sancho finding those papers in Nineteen forty three well\nThere's a question as to whether or not just had a time machine\nAnd that there was something about that the era of wells the era of Tesla and ah this this writer who was a science fiction writer his name was Ingersoll
