we\nShould take a page from history and understand that we're about to witness the return\nOf what would be called the mob or the mob rule or the vigilante justice or perhaps even something a lot worse and the reason why I said this is because of the fact that\nA couple of nights ago I did a show called new in New justice no peace and\nAh I attempted to point out that ... the traditional way we think of civil war in this country is causing the fact\nThat we're already in one and while no one will attribute school shootings to beat the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left and right now is the violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\nPresident Trump warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people and I'm sure he mentioned\nHe did mention that they were on the on the left many people have told me the left or violent Clyde you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent I've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now this type of rhetoric do the Donald Trump talked about the violence if we don't win\nIs now being foot noted and being pointed out by the news that you know they basically saying we'll see you see you see he wants to violence\nYou see the arguments are such that they can be both ways and extremism\nBecame even more intense after CNN's Christian I'm In for\nSat

said about when your husband was being that she ended by investigations back in the Nineteen Abbas white right wing conspiracy\nFirst of all your comment on that merit language and secondly\nThese anyway even a conservative think who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some divinity and to try to make it even if we have political disagreements we're not going to war with each other we're not trying to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see a return to civility listening to want to now there are working out are different that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now when the Republican candidate denied\nThe right as President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice from the ...\nI think they did I mean to keep it in the court said open for a year\nOr to deny distinguishing jury if they could have voted down they could've said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they don't ... and that was such a breach a\nHaunted ethic and the constitutional responsibility of a credit to advise on can harm on Mount a nation that you cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house band or the panel that went to ... start again [noise]\nSo she says when we\nGet the Senate back that sort of civility we'll start again but until then civility or instability if you will will knock him saying\nYou cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy where you stand for and what you care about and that's why she said I Believe if we're fortunate enough to win back the White House and or the Senate that's when civility can start to get there you have a declaration of civil war and a license for violence\nDonald Trump said violence if the Republicans don't get the vote Hillary Clinton says violence until we get the boat or we we have this instability until we get the votes so\nThe motive of course is getting what you want by any means necessary not not the vote matters just how much trouble intimidation and instability you can create\nIn order to change the direction of the vote and that's that's very disconcerting\nAnd it's on president I mean while while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comments she made Hillary Clinton made no one not even her interviewer\nChristian I'm a poor\nCheating stopper and say wait a minute wait a minute are you saying\n... you know the civil war would continue or it's really ... I mean she didn't say this is reckless shouldn't say you're fueling the fire you know the fire it's already been started consequences be damned a civil war has to happen in order to take over the ... that's that's what I'm getting from both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump\nI mean her claim disability can return when Democrats have power is it a mission that the ends justify the meat\nI mean this is at a time when Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beating mailed a merry mailed and rice and powders of run out of restaurant set death threats I mean Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more on\nCivil [noise] I mean [noise] what is it [noise]\nI mean I said two nights ago that this is a civil war New York post yesterday said this is these are words the civil war [noise] and now hearing Hillary Clinton I'm beginning to think well look\nIf they're going to keep being angry and keep doing these problems up until the the boat and then they changed the vote and then the Republicans get violent [noise]\nWhat what are we in what is it true beliefs except at three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise] news radio six Ninety J.

war means it does not mean\nA civil war no not necessary evil means no not necessarily not at all civil means states Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means within state\nInstead of with other states that is what civil war means and that's the idea was civility nothing\nHowever\nHillary said the exact opposite of go do a the violence that the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the worst civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word\nAs I said it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it\nWow she all she had it was dropped that\nWord because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying

start down\nSaying like you're automatically already or you're automatically the enemy and they\nFly Lewis you are listening to ground zero you know I Hope that [noise] having this dialogue and demonstrating what is happening here will avoid a civil war or some sort of horrible civil people that's\nThe point of the show tonight because I Want to point out to you how it's done and\nWhat they're doing and this is how it's setting up using react to it the way you want to react to it or you know you can say hey I'm not going to buy into this crap I'm not going to buy into dividing my country allowing you to be conquered by some global is you know infrastructure it's not going to have to\nGo to Bradley in Pennsylvania highbrow beyond ground zero\nHey did you know you you mentioned you mentioned holder said about public and to hold up\nA little bit sounds good over the phone yeah we'll do it oh go ahead but boy it\nLook like when we were willing to me [laughter] [laughter]\nThat was\nWhen we go low you when when they go low we go high but instead we go where they go low we kick them that's what he said\nHe was that were national supporting do national candidates Stacey Abrams and stuff which Georgia [noise]\n[noise] so okay let me let me a ... there's a clarification I got to read the clarification this is from the Washington Post ready for this so they're saying about what he said uh after holder said uh when they go low we kick 'em misses the Washington Post claimed\nHe then said that he's not advocating anything Olympic when I say we you know we kick them I don't mean we do anything in property we don't do anything illegal holder said but we got to be tough\nWe have to fight for the very things that civil rights leaders John Lewis Martin Luther king Whitney Young you know all those folks are you doing so the kinda clarified that because he realized I think what he said you know there you go\nBut the thing about that I think there's there's there's there's idiots cause that all these people have said they stay all these things and that oh wait I didn't but there is the part that the craziest already believe that that is what they're passionate\nWell it's like what Sarah said the dog whistle with the dog was it like you know they say it and like you said the people that are radical here at me leave they go oh yeah\nThat's what we do we keep being a\nYou know getting in people's faces until we when you see they don't say that the Trump things they oh Trump advocating violence know this this ... this is something we're not doing but it is it's dog whistling their dog whistling their people to kick them when they're low their dog whistling their people to be an civil until everything\nYou know goes down the way they want it to and then what happens is immediately both ... and the guys who go groups groups that we'd better we're going to make some moves soon because I think maybe we don't want to be held responsible if there's a civil war so\nBut the thing about that anyone who says Hillary Clinton does not know what she's feeling sorry for that woman who called you yeah idiot Hillary Clinton knows one hundred percent ... exactly what she is and there was no one that can give me otherwise\n... okay friendly things for the call and good out of breath in Michigan Hi Brett you're on ground zero [noise] hey man
