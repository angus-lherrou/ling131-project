Natasha ... they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kind of ... and Joe will stick to my stomach I Know the earliest days will be which Reese expiration situation ... one of those\nSitting chapters in human history that's why I like NASA 'cause I like reading about Gus Grissom on like reading about and uh you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Sharon in ... and I I like reading about all these guys\nYou know I write a report about the team um I got in in in my office and maybe if I can get wrong to\nGet out of the opposite can take a picture and put on a on Facebook I've got\nUm\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something it's supposed to be the Apollo Thirteen no non profit the Apollo fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed I have it's it's kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I uh I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he work for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me uh it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that\nWas telling me you should do shows about this shows but that asks why this isn't happening announcing that enemy big conspiracy theories about NASA and he worked for us to actually so yeah you ain't\nGoing to see first man is going to be cool because it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen or any other space movie\nRunning with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort to go to the moon and they had limited time table\nAnd their efforts gave us the Gemini program and the Apollo moon landing with Neil Armstrong acting is the first human ... to an extraterrestrial world\nAnd there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and and go in and doing it and you know touching putting his foot on the lunar soil and all that\nWhether or not there aliens there whether or not they saw structures they're I mean there's all kinds of things that you can speculate about\nBut almost from the point of the first Apollo mission there were many Americans they expressed skepticism that the whole event taking place at all it\nHad they argued been faked in Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury complex conspiracy theories involving international intrigued murderous criminality also using money to foot the war effort in Vietnam\nThis was all thrown together as a propaganda basically a propaganda scam\nTo make the Russians feel inferior and to be honest it worked\n\nIs whatever it was I mean\nThe Russians were ahead of us in the space race\n\nThen one day they find out that we've got amount on the moon immediately as hell we don't want to do that and see and that's what has always bothered me about\nThe moon landing as we landed on the moon\n\nAnd it's kinda like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top there are several other people who want to climate ... efforts to do the same they don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like Everest right we go about every sweet land on Mt Everest and the Russians that worked so hard to go about average decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they in the second on the moon why when when the when the whole fever pitch was going on we're we're the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up there Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission\nThey would rather you know watch Lucille Ball I mean what are they\nAre rather watching Lucille Ball wondering of busier and as a kid or whoever was going to have a baby or I\nIt was like you know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one cool second one okay third one huh [laughter] okay about about how their lives ruined thing let's hear a lot of people that had skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all when we landed\nAmong Americans between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old this is figures from the Nineteen sixties uh twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon\nAnd over the years there have been many more dollars and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science dinner\nYou're up there with Blatter's right\nUh [noise] that's about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time now and there are a lot of people that don't believe that was it turns out\nThroughout the latter third of the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first\nConfidence in the United states government by the American public he'd been in decline and those who remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate nine eleven attacks all these other scandals and now faces they find it\nEasier to say well you know the government's lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied it was about the moon landing and what's really weird is is that\nYou know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing is probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nYou ... you know using ... you can question Ira and that's that's kinda bad because people's lives how dare you there was the most horrible event and history and you're questioning of people died\nThat that you get that all the time you're\nTalking about Watergate and yeah you do some\n... they don't care about Watergate I don't care about Monica Lewinsky stress but yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that\nYou look at all the money they put into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years\nAnd the rockets or what happened to them and you know all these questions that people have it and when you start speculating they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back at a pow Lebanon and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths in the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent\nThree guys out in the space and nothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the\nWhen the alarm on the Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife says you're not going to the moon no way oh yeah I Am I mean I'm going to the moon no not after you crossed to the lunar lander on her as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not gonna crash it on the moon I trust me we're not going to do that\nYou see the space shuttle blows up or astronauts are killed by a software program for a year to figure out what the hell happened back then ah we got a timetable to meet you know Neal if you cross the lunar lander tough luck Charlie you're going up into space you're doing that one small step for man speech\nThat's what happened\nAnd you're going to do it with technology but for the equivalent of the computer technology in your toaster of it that's how we're going to do with guys and you're going to be sitting in something the size of a phone booth with those huge backpacks on your back here to take pictures of the moon which something\nEquivalent of and mittens Hi you're going to do it well we got all figured out now there's the house is going to be done without people questioning what we've got that I'll figure it out to\nNo one will question it it'll be the most brilliant thing ever you're going to the moon and you know you're going to the moon and the American people know you're going to the moon except except that [noise]\nThere are a lot of things we're not going to tell them about how we're doing this magic [noise]\nAnd a lot of things were going to

right off the bat you know people are already thinking just a minute we landed on the moon that nobody that we didn't win it didn't go\nThere was a communist propaganda you know the you know whatever so\nI did the show and then uh I think it was February of two thousand and one I was very surprised when Fox or did a special called conspiracy theory did we land on the moon\nAnd uh\nThat changed the entire nature of the debate because this went mainstream and this is just such a this was a situation where a major network presented a conspiracy scenario without any serious rebuttal it was reported

Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and conduct the first man mission no later than twenty fourteen\nWhere we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about saving for space to receive signing and land on the moon is this going to go around them\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace as up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even um our space could have been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out of the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah and\nOf course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide and that you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to\nDo this two days or two days shy of the forty F anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about\nThat mission that did all adds up didn't make any sense\nAnd\n... eleven after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards data that climate change climate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn nasty and the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time\nBut now that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream we're gonna probably money forward then Obama says not not that we're not going to go so here we are and twenty Eighteen again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\nTo news stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but ah some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds a parent late may have detected what appear to be to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sounds of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but um yeah they they detected these stars are putting off a sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\n\nI'm kidding I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars\nThey start collecting stars and they they've warned them out there saying well if these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be collecting stars at all what are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\n[noise] um [noise]\nNASA also reporting today that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe briefing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance of including astrobiology\nThe study of how life originated on her than how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we're Seventeen scientists saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again every mission is going to be about finding life in space that have to have a a quest of finding life in space Russia\nSays they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space our mother heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding life giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures and get this\nAstrophysicist are now saying\nThat with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity of diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\n\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms ... signatures take those things I mean look I'm president of the universe is more crammed with plants never before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to efforts to six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet so the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures\nFighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space in the report\nAnd sciences recommended at NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single fight ready instrument that can travel\nTo a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals in organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppressed starlight should be used outside our solar system to improve detection of bio signatures from planet that might or but those stars NASA could also play more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\nWhether or not they're rock the icy or ocean worlds defined subterranean Amy live

[noise] the radio show that\nKeeps you up late [noise] like I say say especially a load of all the driveway losers tonight [noise] was stuck in the driveway listen to the program the want to leave your car do you I wouldn't even [noise]\nOh cool things to talk about that I AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise] that is true belief six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\n\nGo to Michael in Oregon Hi Michael you're on ground zero\nFor a long time first I think you know all\nAbout it I just enjoy your show but I'm about that ... that if you think about it what that's what more genius way to blow up somebody thinking he got more technology than yeah\nVideo pick of moon landing right well I don't know if they get a knot I'm just saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this a T Barnes was on the show when they could be classified some ox carts that project ... guard with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that the new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put cardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft\nOh I remember something\nOr they used they used to put up fake aircraft that big cardboard airplanes they used to put on the on the runways review wanting to fool the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I mean there are plenty and they're putting fake cardboard planes\nMcAteer he picked the one that can easily uh put together some you know grace soil put it somewhere on the sound stage and uh and make it happen they they could easily do that I mean I don't see why it it's beyond the pale the thing they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a of a moon modeled just like they did or you know for Star Wars I mean\nWhat Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nOr what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean who would've thought miniatures so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah that's yeah and they they could possibly do it but you know and then another thing I I don't think our scientists now\nHave the engineering backgrounds has it for now set back then as well\nSo that could be another thing lighter not coming up with things you know if you think about it they're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be alone or half of them oh well I Know they have like a magnetic signature\nAnd see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they had this idea just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want you all the you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find alien life whatever you do from conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to now over putting to lay\nOut right yeah when I have to weigh out there that I I ... either\nWay I I think I Will come out in the next few years whether that it or not it'll have to\nWell I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean they were going to go back on their ideas or he went to the moon but thinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of crazy stuff I mean what if you said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know who gave me a little bit of money you act you know you\nRead this or that fills space race it a little more interesting and I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race if it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge you do a race that I have compared to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the ... guy saying\nHey I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna run race with you and I'm going to beat you and then in the ... and the and the the guy it's all going to say OK guy given a chance and so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "El Paso", "day": "13"}
