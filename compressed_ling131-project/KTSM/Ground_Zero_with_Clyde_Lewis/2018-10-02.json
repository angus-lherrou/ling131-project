and we said look very nerd but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them and of course a lotta I'd said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected\nTo more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program it was a writer and he said uh you has had more gallons or has more gallons he said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have their propensity

we were talking about if you were like God Matt and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going in so smart city networks in your part of the woods and you got to do it quick

it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done and people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're gonna have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance
