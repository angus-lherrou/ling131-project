know there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready\nWhen I was in South America\nAnd I lived there and I lived there in the middle of well it was a regret in the middle of it was toward the end of their civil war that was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war I saw civil war in a whole new life it was different than the two sided civil war we had in the Eighteen hundreds it was uh something else it was civil war in\nContemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nWhen I say when the Saudis I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a South America is\nSpain or France or or or if it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's an amazing city very or urban very ah advanced advanced technologies they're\nUsually try them out down there the bill worked down there they do they come up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so\nThe biggest concern for a lot of Americans is what's going to happen to this country what what is going on\nAnd when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet I always hear people say quiet it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know Judy know did they ever lived through one do we know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nI said to myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of a reality that uh is out of control\nI mean we have new laws the executive orders that pretty much enable the president\nTo act with the emergency Powers Act I mean he could make plans any time to just\nArrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that's probably in the works some sort of a\nA rest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see a big illegally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or or this or you know very soft coup\nOr the the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft coup\nOther behaviors with ah you know certain people\nAnd how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean\nLook I Know that if you\nSay that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing this he's planning on exposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration even before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\nAnd the political sour grapes get political splinter groups and with political splinter groups you get the uh marginalizing fragmentation of our

ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\nBut it's certainly cynics that are there in order to keep telling yourself in America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed\nAnd they're living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and\nIt is a real experience that I talked about that in the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern days in a modern city modernist city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states the civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference see I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different\nTo the normal news cycle it would regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\nSeattle we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks\nAnd these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash\nThey're simply done in\nOrder to provoke a response if the responses overwhelming and police departments cannot keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either\nBe the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with how or if if if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at\nFirst but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied\nTo a situation I don't know if there will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no it's not how it's going to be\n... with civil war will be in the United states if this happens no it's not modern civil war would have many so called sight seeing the dirty war of South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is\nKind of nice to the radical ... the communist coming in

I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band of terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture\nOf course the government had access to the police had access to corrupt cops had access to military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well\nYour poll by the way was part of that group\nFeeding America we'd have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all this stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kimmons there was a black man who was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allowed the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti ... what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing\nWrong and it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again to police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nI had a three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again of a civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states there would not be two\nSides fighting we could see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nTheir separatist groups in America the militia groups oath keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together\nAnd feel the flames for civil war\nOthers or does the Kennedys could be criminal gangs like MS Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more
