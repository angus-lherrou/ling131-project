they were the lights on the strip and uh\nAnd I remember saying something after the eclipse you know last year I said hey this is going to be this eclipse and then we'd better be prepared for something happening because you know\nUm we see the or\nShe the repercussions of everything happening you know September through through October\nAnd then we have the shooting and uh of course ah when I was talking with Alex about nine eleven\nUm I I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know ... project for new American Century look what they wrote about in the new Pearl Harbor ideas baby produced the demand you are the signatories on the on the document\nOr do you look at the ... you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they mix said that there was going to be or there can be a even a biological attack or some sort of biological attack\nThat could happen and uh it would certainly uh make differences in political movement that would change the way politics would run and of course in nine eleven even during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact uh believe it was\nJust a few weeks or a week afterwards and then everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October for ...\nBelieve of ah of two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax and so I'm Joan said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said\nWhat do you think the final ... gonna be and I says I said to him I said well I you know I kind of hesitated\nBit because I was afraid

know damn good well it's not going to end right because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack on the United states\nAnd ah I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the ... to exercise and they talked about the the uh the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being ... they're all preparing we have all these uh\nYou know tabletop exercises about biological pandemic events biological attacks and um\nYou know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being used I you know we speculated on many different ways\nOf this would happen would be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slides attack or you know maybe ... it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nUm\nIt was very surprised and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I wondered when it was going to happen I didn't think it would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poison and rice and\nArrived at the Pentagon I'm the opposite the president's Senator Ted Cruz is off\nSo I'm a\nBiological attack a happen today um biological poison\nRice in uh taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day we made you drink castor oil in order to you know purge crap in your body well there's a reason why is because Castro beans can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's rice and\nAnd it was reported a of the two packages containing rice in were intercepted on the way the Pentagon\nAnd he was confirmed by the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged mail delivery

it is and I said it's going to be a biological attack on the United states because I agree I agree that um\nAnd uh I think I'm going on his show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that yelling and talking about this ah\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo they're they're preparing for some biological attack some\nContamination some toxic release um I talked to a geena function exercise is something that most people don't know about it and bring it to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson ... form of something that he released into the public\nIs test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking a hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work that you know it's just the way for\nA the CDC and others to to to monitor the movie the disease and some people do support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently is live TV show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was a ... that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets Bola Andy brings into the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the

through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in an ounce and they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation into the packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... that there was an address to James Mattis\nChief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office the FBI released this statement\nThis was a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen and coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nHe's envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is opening contain white powder and so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found\nPentagon also reports that rice and\nWas detected and that uh and and so we're having\nA full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd this reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA biological markers that would you would actually activate this stuff and and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected if you inhale it and so you can survive a inhaling\nA rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nA in Dallas, Oregon\nAnd ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to um distract us from it\nOr there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night at ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision it and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and cabinet can be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger\nWith a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually\nBecomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just as peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on ours Jonah show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who\nLet's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact yeah because I remember when we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down\n\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy and one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for the students happen or not always right before damn close believe it or not for damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if\nThis gets out of hand [noise] I'd say be prepared because if the word goes down tomorrow that

thoughts um I Do I like how you uh you know you always see these patterns and it is interesting we're right before that that called them are that that text tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that as soon as possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I if I were a word but could it be that actually\nThe right side the right wing so to speak\nOr could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting of course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have\nTed Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the fall it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\nSure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations law but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was to thwart the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday they said well that week's

official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect all the mail to find out of rice and was involved and made the announcement the rice and was in the package is one of the of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of is on other major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting of course Mitch McConnell and others of course giving him the faces I mean like they do it's like they're not getting into faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapists and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nYeah it totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows who knows who's responsible for these rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted

because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest you know\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about Kavanaugh in his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by\n... now you have the astronaut elation CJ I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when I'm more science news that I heard it already from inside of that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressured them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just to value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but don't Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nAs a matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women as I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of
