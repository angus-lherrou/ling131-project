this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult\nStudies and one of those studies is the study of

every line one one one times the six\nColumns and rose equals six six six so that is a number of the sun then of course is the magic square of Saturn which is a square with three columns and three

which would put it a pre ... so what ages that I'm not really sure\nSo it was the pre atomic it would ... be pre a dynamic I mean the we go all the way back before pre genesis\nOr well it's in all that it's your gas as good as mine 'cause you know it's the most amazing artifact and what I Do with it mainly is use it because it is a tool for helping people especially right now that the world seems like it needs a lot of help and the skull is works on that very well\nCycle Ryan was saying he said we need to take these ah symbols and we need\nTo take away the warped values and add value to them and use them to help us guide us and uh and uh keep us or you know pretty much on track for what these ... I mean sure a lot of ... street maybe dark a lot of problems she may not be good but there's always hope that as a lead with it as well am I correct\nOr I think the hope is the real thing\nAnd I think the ... the minds of the men\nAre given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever we can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull\nOr you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts in their mind about a ... but when you see that especially in the Mitchell head just go and you see the workman ship and the love that went into it\nAnd it uh it just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a\nIt's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always\nAdmired for its work which ship and how beautiful it is and the power it's certainly possesses incense through and uh the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling it's certainly a is inspiring a and and\nI guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is this president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and like you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so uh it's believed to be a risk ...\nOf mind and\nIt the ... mind has been programmed by the ancient masters with the knowledge of the universe so uh it's it's here and it's it comes through it's very very a shuttle but very powerful\nCertainly I'm sure it has a lot of things to tell us I'm sure it has a lot of things that's\nAnd we have a of course we have a lot of things a lot of uh I'd say uh\nYou know people who want to join into the program tonight we'll kill Dave is coming up tonight\nWho we've had on the program before she's a medium or and also uh I guess it's like it can away she's she's she is a person communicates the skull\nAnd she'll be

what does your mind if he's written books about crystal skull heavy not\nOh he's he's one of the more experts on the crystal skulls he he works with them for a number of years he's written books he's a doctor and a a he has a lot to say about my that's what I Would I think it'd be interesting to hear what he has to say\nOr even a drop out let's go to let's go to job right now job you there yeah I mean here\nAnd it's good to have you on the program thank you for being on the program with us we're here with the bill and of course the crystal skull or tell us about your interest in how your interest began in this in this subject\nWell it began ... experience all and in Nineteen but looked at the Nineteen Ninety four I met but at least I didn't know what it was but it turns out to be a crystal called at somebody put in my hands\nAnd Austin disclosed eyes are asked me to feel\nThat I started to cry like a little baby\nAnd that was a reason to stop a ledger and he goes why would a girl up guys are crying is something he doesn't know what it is and it turns out to be a crystal skull as interesting because it was a contemporary crystals called it was not a lot of that ancient walls is a lot of information and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wheat and it is interesting because in that time is up many pistol calls route and so\nOn the Internet which was the first of all that it appears\nThat Michel ... is the oil and had this fascination that one day I Would need an angel and just a ... to ... thousand seven bill and bill came\nFor the call that the that I co organized and that is on I saw this call but in the meantime I've been studying calls I'm trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box a cute is that's the name of that\nLike ... like you know\nYeah uh it goes to key words\nI think as soon as you start working this crystal skull is consciousness yes you were mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but also links into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system out as well the best system so are you a without their knowledge or you can put information and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of inflammation that'd be now try\nTo access you know a lot of the interesting things and that is is\nWe have not being very successful yes there are channels and that it isn't that are that is far more information and that they still call [noise] so people\nAre searching for how can you access even this information because then they will ... skull contains\nCharlotte's inhalation I remember a story of a company which which a company\nWas working with feeding itself courts and they were putting inflation into this tiny piece off artificial and crystal and they say that it is science over ... chicken put almost whole library\nWhile ... imagine and looking at the\n... Michel ... says Chris ... how much information that can be an right no brain\nNo human brain that can really get all that information\nSo I think the reason why that are so many crystals called out in the wall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train\nBut they can't access information and crystal skulls so that to get her and this will be a very very important point to get rid of peace to gather information that the ancient put into the crystal skull\nAnd I think that's important it's very important because as you say a quartz crystal is every quarter it does ah maintain a or at least holds onto a ancient technology in Egypt information and as you were saying you talked about the the black cube you talked about\nUh just what they used it for the use it as a transmitted ... the value of arc of the covenant was an example of a of a cue\nThe holy moly through the temple example the cube and are they actually utilize the courts crystal crystal skulls reports from London mind simple ... they were able to utilize these very artifacts ancient ancient technology it's been used in the past that we have here in Studio tonight\nBill home in with his notes on the phone Dr John ... with us to talk about the crystal skull more information coming up\nAnd your calls her belief except for three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm Lou as you listen to ground zero and we'll be back\nYou're listening to news radio six Ninety K DSM [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck\nIn the garage or in a closet wouldn't it be great if there was a safe that had to look at my beautiful empty so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the rhino iron works at rhino safe dot com\nMy like my mother taught me at first you don't succeed cut your losses and run by\n... don't be a day but your perfect global employee I El Paso help on the dot com local job doesn't work El Paso help on the dot com present the world's worst boss but wonder if those jobs don't you just do jobs like looking for anyone with a pulse will just call him a date things do you know\nWhy we're getting applications from jugglers in tightrope walkers\nI just posted on a national jobs I did this job can be a balancing act and you have to juggle many tasks\nBut the job is for head of accounting some of the applicants include lion tamer ... have\nYou met the guys in accounting animals\nDon't be a day but your perfect mobile employee I El Paso help wanted not called local jobs ...\nHow can I help my daughter was ...\nFor help with Dr reading but\nHow can I help my daughter was reading\nInformation on hot water heater no surprise when she's reading\nSeveral sounded out the words\nWorld music playing track now [noise]\nLet me try [noise]\nOur daughter gets confused about which detailed and a story are important which paper towels are ... there are five product reviews why are you not getting me see I told the\nWeight I was trying to show how fat meal every day trading is Annette redirecting too I stood dot org\nFor the one in five kids with learning and attention issues this is my life can feel like\nExplore understood that Oregon a free online resource about learning attention issues designed to help your child private school\nUnderstood that or the understanding is everything\nI have I understood that bought any\nUm boating in the mid term elections because my carpet group or why because my ancestors died snake for my children went into for me I unlike the weekend remain free helping the community out including in\nThe mid term elections because every vote make for that matter vote I vote I vote in the near term election\nTo register to vote go to I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November ... media and the culture collection\nWays just minutes away from the latest news around down around the world\nFor you know what's going on especially around the well news radio six Ninety eight T.
