is the dark powers and whether it powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation to the map it\nWould be increasing globally should a globalization of political economic institutions it's becoming easier for a relatively small group to deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions\nAnd one couple in particular reveals alarmingly ... another small group will do it's driven by financial belief systems and a cult things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there may be conspiracy writers and observers the tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we heat has control over the world the spiritual realm but what is the thriving right now and then it's globalization\nA lot of frightening and somewhat complex things that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why I come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the masons the Jesuits accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual rounds of what appears to be the superior called however it becomes more complicated\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or priest craft that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I Would I put into this program every night every major step\nIn the development of the new world order from simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\n\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he had an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century and\nTo him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is predestined rural absolutely at odds with the band emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so\nHe wanted to transmit the secretive synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual fathers assert our the workhorse the knights Templar and other groups that\nYou know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hitting meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually uses the darker powers to greet as sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group of conspiracy of men or women that form of priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing their power plays within the United states and would be in the world\nThe formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies went from there there were other conspiracy groups other secrets societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America I Believe that the establishment of the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies this is half true because the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian\nIndian bordered on things like her medic arcane in Manassas ism except for the very beginning we've always had that group\nThat are simply observers they they they're custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles through the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching of any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God God did they don't approve of\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was if any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why they're really oligarchy in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\nAnd this is why when you see things happen that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Christ like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not gonna give you an exact date I Can't
