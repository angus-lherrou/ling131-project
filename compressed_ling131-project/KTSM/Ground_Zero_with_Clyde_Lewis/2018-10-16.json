President Trump is coming up on top after Los Angeles judge dismissed a defamation claim filed by adult film actress Stormy Daniels Daniels accused Trump of defamation after he said she was lying about being threatened over an alleged affair a decade ago\nPeas it's not about a week ago I'm a ... show was about ready to drop the records and uh I I was talking about the deep state and\nOne of the things that bothers me about the state is that it's it's the most overused term since false flag a because\nWell because of shows like Alex Jones but because of uh what people say and what they think they'd be like a a big big like a false flag is like\nA didn't really happen so it's a false flag that's not a false flag okay and I've always felt told people tell people that are false flag but of course you know a lot of ignorance is bred when people tend to think that one thing means another thing and and they ... the people the defining their own terms\nYou know that they are defining what is the conservative defining what is the liberal people don't even know anymore I mean really don't\n... it and they don't know what are you a critical analysis that are objectivity anymore because if somebody says one day\nThat he can't stand you know Donald Trump being a noxious because he is he's obnoxious there's no doubt in my mind you eat these obnoxious he's obviously is obnoxious okay so he's not noxious president you say so that was going out or do I was ... liberal\nWell come on even if you're conservative you have to admit sees help noxious if if you if you can't you're you're not being genuine you're not being being disingenuous and you know if you're if you're like saying if you can't say that Hillary Clinton is obnoxious\n... your your disingenuous because she is obnoxious she's up noxious Donald Trump's obnoxious but the only difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is president the United states and he was voted in by the people that's the difference okay and as your obnoxious president\nWe are supposed to ah criticized him for things that he does wrong and we do a same with ... for the same about Barack Obama and people say I like Morocco bother the and I'd say look you know bronco bombers our president\nAnd um\nWe should try to give him some time given the honeymoon that he deserves but you know we didn't give Donald Trump the honeymoon for sure [laughter] no hey nobody gave him a honeymoon\nAnd a and one of the things that's interesting is that you know between the false flag a\nNomenclature being bastard dies the other was the other was the deep state because they think it's an invention of Donald Trump and it's not\nIn fact the deep state was a shadow government one time there is also a the dark state there's also a what is it a dark command there there are several names so that each state it's just a deep state stuck with Donald Trump and what's most troubling about this accusation is that certainly the tactic being used as somehow discredit conspiracy theorists\nAnd others in the media feels are right wing extremist pushing the ever present persecution complex of the president listen uh\nLet me just tell you this back\nWhen the Democrats were in power there's a vast right wing conspiracy now uh now that the debt that the Republicans are in power there's a vast left wing conspiracy so is it or or no it's just there's a conspiracy\nAnd what it is is that it's it's meddling from the deep state operatives all over the world not just here in the United states not just Russia\nIt's all over the world is these deep state players they wanted to come in and undermine this country\nAnd they undermine that by by programming a weirdos to actually go on to Facebook pages and start declaring that a certain person is a certain type of a leading towards a certain type of ideology in in politics which isn't the case because when you are doing a conspiracy\nAnalysis of geopolitical players\nYou couldn't talk about anybody and say what they do is good or bad and there's always somebody there they will tell you well obviously this is how you think all the time no it's not\nAnd so when you're looking at the deep state\nIt's it's not an American delusion ... if it's not you know ... is it is a worldwide phenomenon okay\nThe deep state on a global level right now is needed in order for the elites just that was what they called the liberal international order which pure and simple as new speak for new world order liberal conservative whatever it might be it is a new world order and it's being established now conspiracies definitely trying to overthrow\n... and they tried to overthrow many presidents including Brock Obama so they're overthrowing bronco bothering him you know overthrowing George Bush ah in fact they successfully a I think uh they they successfully were able to a command and also a puppet George W. Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that\nAnd a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they puff it at a mall or the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump stubborn Donald Trump's stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people and what would the deep state do to try and change all this while we've seen what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic kids you know of a of a noted officials they kill people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whenever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all that certainly is controlling this country and is trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or are getting a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards you know the conspiracy\nIs there\nTo metal in the affairs of nations all over the world\nThat are struggling to keep their sovereignty and this is why there are few oligarchy\nOr willing to buy up in support chaos in the world\nAnd this is why we're now seeing in our major cities gang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds and we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out you see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there are there many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country are not the bad actors on the world stage that wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burn the truth is there are many Americans that have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the coaching covered a seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change and that if you're a people will stop and realize they've

is a difference of just being clean up political what you're showing you just showing the Lincoln grew in it can ruin the the inconsistencies of what politics are doing right now and then sometimes you'll say well what Donald Trump is doing is really kind of silly or what\nWhat's going on now is you know as I said the other night I said you know or what Donald Trump spoke to a bunch of clergy man and he said here's the deal if we don't get the Senate there's gonna be violence okay and then the other he couldn't\nGo I'm not going to be civil and you don't have to be civil to a government

worry about now our fellow countrymen and whether or not our fellow countrymen are gonna rise up against this and this is a product of what we're in the middle of now they take it at least Eighteen

why and so I brought up this book called possess the devils it's a book was written by a ...\nAnd uh it was pre revolutionary or if it were at the details that the middle class society would be destroyed through a crackdown on dissent\nDenial is expected to revolt in a way to the time where the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nDenial is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time whether people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving this power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\n\nYou know I began and does the U.S his book and began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state power that happened\nYou know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\n\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders were the blood bond or the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a of of groups that are are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then\nWe have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting his anti liberty\nIt really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand or except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour and they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find some place by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in antifa but there's also others and you know we have to learn and we have to remember that there are two\nMain dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally adapting this blood Samantha\nBack in time of Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the book the kite blue kite to meaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting ... this is this is how we do terrorism American style is is I Would do civil instability or instability was reduced in civility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up man this guy's down there and wait kind of a referee uh between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of do CFC we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nIt's the way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats the citizens like faceless statistics and economic units three bought sold barter traded in track\nIt lies the system lives it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent their empire\nSo what they do is they create wars they they\nUh they take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little and so we have is deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state a global industrial deep state\nAnd so it's like ... like you know network where are the Ned Beatty says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that that that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up\n\nRising up all the middle eastern terrorists and now it's us but it needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate and its failed us\n\nAnd and what they have is they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically the dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like we burned the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be Gabby happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this coercive solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\n\nIn the end if we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step and say well you gotta clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody's at each other's throats then we got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we need an intervention of some ...\nYeah we do that with other countries\nWe did that with other countries it it you know we're we see something going on in Iran or Iraq and we see a civil war we step in we sending soldiers would try to clear up the problem\nHow would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and shyness as you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops there to take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are you realize it but if someone decides that we're just at each other's throats too much they decided they just want to walk in and clean house they will\nAnd boy you won't like that will you be fighting against one enemy or will all be fighting amongst ourselves well there are coming in and taking over\nBecause the whole future [noise] we have right now has been open ended because of nine

fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order that wants to take over go to Jackie in California Hi Jack you're on ground zero\nHi Clyde yeah this is a interesting story but there's a couple of things that just didn't ring true to me about how do you pronounce his name ...\nLike ... ...\n... you know\nSo you had a the Turks came out and\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the hit team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys over there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the story from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now\nBecause you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nWould have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide beads stay manipulation it is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish and we're looking at\nA another indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil's going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is a Saudi citizens\nAnd he was actually in a Saudi embassy which\nMakes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even\nBe involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here in the United states as a consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressure to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed in was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but ah they move them out of the country\nApplied if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it team\nProbably do the same reason you say they use in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory that can get in there and empathy and do anything about it\nWell but but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey argue with the CIA was facilitating operation deeply opportune argument that he said operatives the IRA were facilitators to the murder of is a um a ...\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian us to be said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more because the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that can happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia is\nHis name I have a feeling do need to do that while I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you've got boom who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yep and they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you play it was even in the next day if you play it was an even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I mean number I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gas up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day\nAnd then that day she gets up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now they've pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means a that we're going to fall back on our oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo we're looking at ten dollars a ... a gallon\nOr easily by ... I don't know does\nDoes a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea that has banned for the bait and retaliate\nSo I'll watch and wait now right that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about Joe ... show and I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know what to say that I looked over and I figured well gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America\nStabilized this from the pomp and stabilizes with inflation destabilized this\nWith an economy that's going to go by and then what will we have new will have to be put on a war footing by by Christmas Time\nRight and and remember the key thing is though if if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nAnd so do you think this is a well once again the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad and making them by putting him in a position where he has to make the decision I think\nHe made a good point that they not only the Turkish government but the CIA is a facilitator because I've always maintain that there's elements inside a all of our main intelligence agencies including the CIA that hey Trump and they want to get rid of trumpet and it costs\nLike well it's always something like this to\nHappen it's creating the it's creating the atmosphere in the environment\nFor a global is to Lucian meeting that he doesn't work in America anymore the guy or something\nYou might have missed there there was last night and National Geographic special about the secret service\nAnd they talked about I'm a real story about an assassination attempt on President Trump while he was in a foreign country and kinda was behind it\nInteresting well we'll we'll see what happens but like I said right now this is certainly you know that's the whole purpose of the show tonight was discovering to show\nHow the deep seated worldwide thing about bad for these states worldwide yeah BMI ... yang I'm you know Christmas\nFor both you and your partner experienced this week number bank exclusively at one of their five hundred and fifty stores nationwide\nChecked him out as we've number dot com slash dry ...\nOver the past fifty years Moore mentors have helped more than ten million small business owners the for free\nStarting business can be incredibly confusing score really helped me share the course\nWhatever the business there's a score mentor that has the experience to know how to help you reach your goal court mentors\nAre serious business experts\nWhether you're a start up or an existing business Gore can provide the perspective and the vice that ensures that\nMuch squirm rupture ... tremendously helpful in March march ...\nScores a nonprofit organization where we provide free business consulting services to people who want to start a business or any of\nThem are you starting or growing a business [noise]\nBe one of the next ten million small businesses helped for free and go\nGet your free business mentor at court out or\nGetting ready to being shot is new to view streaming edition\nThis month has no shortage of Netflix Original to take over your TV\nDue out this week is part two of making a murderer these um three of marble daredevil man Ronnie White new comedy special get expert advice on allergies sleep diet and more with the help from the new documentary series ask the doctors and illusion is Darren Brown is back on Netflix with a new special called sacrifice\nSome flicks getting out of the Amazon Prime this week include the claustrophobic horror movie devil by young Jake Gyllenhaal and the weird cool Donnie ... of pizza place built on a gateway to hell why not the new horror comedy flights comes out\nThis week and hand on the complete opposite side of the spectrum kids Daniel tiger movie lands on prime [noise]\nSubscribers can be your premieres on with the Alec Baldwin show the season to buy from Europe Blackfish the debut of the counters the kids are All right and more this week on Hulu and that and they wouldn't be streaming edition heart radio a farmer\n...
