because the machinery could not handle the\nTremendous volume of trading in the aftermath of black Tuesday America and the rest of the industrialized world spiral downward into the great depression this week in Nineteen thirty eight worse than wells causes a nationwide panic with his broadcast the\nWar of the world's a realistic radio dramatization a Martian invasion of earth perhaps as many as a million radio listeners believe that a real Martian invasion was underway panic broke out across the country in New Jersey where the made up story took\nPlace terrified civilians Jim highway seeking to escape the alien ... when news of the real life panic leaked into the CBS studio wells went on air as themselves to remind listeners that this was just fiction\nThis week in Nineteen Seventy four thirty two year old Muhammad Ali becomes the heavyweight champion of the world for the second time when he knocked out twenty five year old chance George Foreman Hindi eighth round of the rumble in the jungle seven years before we had lost his title when the government accused him of draft dodging in the box and commissioned took away his license\nHis victory in Zaire made him only the second dethrone champion history to regain his belt\nTo have the Seventy five stone steps where the where are the priest threw himself down the steps and killed himself in The Exorcist kind of a creepy a landmark they want to have and George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in fact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing the steps so I was in Washington DC I mean now we're we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking that's the ... part like um you know I was thinking you could drive to the White House you drive\nTo Washington money we parked at the Washington Monument we walked all the way over\nAn English to the south side of the White House\nAnd we were there when the angle of Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of are dealing with security at the time\nAnd so it slowed down our process than is getting around and do things to say I didn't get a chance to see those steps but um they certainly are creepy and they want to make them a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean [noise] aloe in and all we do we try and give you the best we can I mean it's time of ... it's basically the time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to party although I got on my party and out on the twenty seven kids done costumes of course ah\nI was really excited when Janine sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed as tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything he's got a pizza suit it it's just really cool I saw his picture and uh yeah tomato head from Fort Night and um\nFor those of you that um have beggars the company door for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about it's certainly a tradition that has a\nI don't know Halloween\nIs sending some mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\n\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October\nInstead of the thirty first has to be the last Saturday in October and what's interesting about that is is that I I think people to do that people are saying that you know don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\n\nAnd Halloween of course of the day before all saints day or the deal is one of those a day of the same day of the dead and so it's kind of like a tradition that the night before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker genesis or the spirit world we we um we make Jack o' lanterns to ward off evil spirits but of evil spirits\nYou know they pass over our house as we do it we're supposed to do that is what trick or treaters it's supposed to be it's supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating\nThis year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent it seem to you know\nWe're living in times where where there's this\nDevil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nI mean this year in particular I I've had well I really late heavy on the devil is aspects of holiday because from a social studies perspective\nI think we've reached their time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can we label be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ or\nThe bits that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ the certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of this tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told that to be vigilant we watching the science we're told in the Bible\nWatched the signs and they may warned of a coming of the end days watch the signs they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ to come and go to the ... the apostrophe\nOr many men fall to the to the ills of evil and scripture and they eat ... commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\n[noise] who is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the Arabs have there\nBecause they've been rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this guy bets on Trump my bets on you know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut\nI I Would say that this study or revelation\nOf a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because\nIn a secular world and we're we are in in you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for for Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore\nWe can save the devil is in them the devil's in them any Mimi mighty mow the devils anew the devil is this group the devil is that drove the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nSo did you notice the devil is everywhere and this leads to not conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist but is here to bring down mankind\n\nAnd so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you got to think of the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical overtures mentioned ritual is world events are not simply circumstantial\nBut they are the result\nOf an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs and ancient symbolism\nSecret suicidal a cold is a mineral magic and that affects us any it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you'd say to me well you talk about this all the time you must believe it and it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just know it's there and I know that causal engineering and ritual magic effects everyone regardless\nOf religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say your practice I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um [noise]\nThey ah they answered other philosophy secretly\nAnd [noise]\nOur ugly they're they're using you know new waves that use medical symbolism and they use it\nTo exercise absolute dictatorial control [noise]\nOver the world and they're trying to establish this new world order

well if you're saying that [noise] you know you're against global isn't that makes you an anti Semite will know does not\nSaying that you're not for global as a means you're not for a world order that is going to be led by obese system certainly\nHas been part of privacy for a long time [noise]\nTonight the little beep or is that we're talking about the anti Christ you're talking about the empire of the dark room in the dark wave approaching\nThe dark tsunami demons that we've been warned about [noise]\nBe prepared because we will be feeling the impact of this you know what I mean [noise]\nI'm

are talking about the exercises [noise] bugs you a minutes ago about how about the number one\nForeign film and the reason why it's the number one horror film was because what it does is it\nExploits what it's called the invisible indefinable enemy\nIt's an enemy that comes from a place that we wouldn't expect it and it winds up attaching itself to the innocent oh it comes from\nEither hell or comes from a dimension that we're not aware of\nIt arrives because of temple shifts or disturbances and we started seeing that there is a war\nWhether we psychological or a true spiritual war\nWhere you were the war is is is between mankind and possibly lead you to demons that are hell bent on establishing colder followers were being fed movies that appeared to impart\nThis as fact rather than fantasy\nAnd so now we started seeing the non fiction or the or the fiction becomes non fiction and you know this is where I become a born again dispensation with this is where I become a you know a man who focuses on this guitar allergy because it's thrown into literature movies so much\nI mean many believe these movies have been a a detriment to the fate because well much of what he's shown a written in these books or are these movies putting these movies are not based on any scripture canonized doctrine and not\nYou know that that that the scene and and uh it's actually absorb so much of this stuff it was as been written about the end of the world a bunch of stuff has been written about the anti Christ are performed or shown\nCan be considered heresy\nI mean many movies and many uh stories around Halloween take liberties with\nPassages of scripture\nAnd with interpretations of apocalyptic themes I mean you can take a look at ... for example most of the damage has been bastard

to are those the trumpets\nDinner blown by the angels and we just kind of ride them off of something else science tries to explain them but in reality the are the trumpets being blown [noise]\nI mean [noise]\nWhen you're looking at the beginning of the events in our reality and the exploitation of science and religion and everything else it's always making us wonder\nIf we're really now in the

going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga\nWhich is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a sales oriented\nUm cosmological construct within the human physical ... of action and form that is at its lowest uh a continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics\nPhilosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos ... do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant that we'd be more refined satanism\nRunny absolutely ... absolutely no interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we we're we're we're appalled bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys move in and basically we'd be the you\nKnow we're not even interested in in in the earth whereas didn't transcending beyond even that position so during sending one day when they are really unhappy about the fact that there were so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that was manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is I think we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as we're concerned because of the true\nI'm a a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come a long and we've like eradicated\nOr their land um\nAh their position in the world you know they're they're ... they're simple rights to live so well actually I don't really like to live well I guess is that the you know we've we've completely overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of\nThing but it will actually give animals using childhood oh yeah absolutely um you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you're talking about ... black magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now where the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked to her back when you were part of the C O s\nI uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's sameness believed or at least the way in St Louis bleed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide and said that the actually say that I Would say is there is any more because we go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions of what it is\nAnd I was just curious if this why you left the church is safe you\nKnow I'm ... satanism which is a a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church and devoted to satanism to 'em and acknowledgement at the devil\nI'm as a a as a symbol for um a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's within the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded a literal a cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of\nOf former age old undiscovered um clandestine form of a of the satanic warship\nThat um that you can tap into and that's just not true I'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I've researched it and it's it's either a um [noise] highly embellished ideas around a satanic Didi or be\nBlatantly neo a manifestations created by people who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do well\nMost people and I remember when I first uh was interviewing you there are a lot of people who identified with what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we'd been and are either of them and say well I find it uncomfortable is I find it uncovered that I'm agreeing with what he said because of\nYour position in the church and state now you have your own group\nOf like magic magicians and I mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization meaning you're standing there watching it all a collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically no it won't be\nCleaning up or escape ing it altogether I when I ... I'm just saying that you know I I Am I'm looking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not part of it\nUm the the chaos impairments a transcendent order when we say transcend that we are talking about the ultimate most uh virile form of spiritual um\nA a a destiny and I just sent so I'm the only way that's going to actually happen is to be able to remove oneself from the human equation altogether right okay so um\nBecause we see that this this ultimate deity form which actually cannot in any way be defined because\nShe doesn't exist inside of physical space I was talking about what you're trying to use language you want to try to use formulate what are you mathematically whatever transcribe you can't really\nDo that was difficult it's difficult to actually uh quantify I've said this before when I have arguments or aliens and beaming that humans are mainly a spiritual entity but to not be quantified it's not touch with\nSome tangible it's something that enters in and wants to have you done if even if not physical it's got a a an energy sickness or it can be measured and therefore it's so it's a physical made sure that what has existing inside of physical space
