what happened to a missing journalist\nTrauma made the comment to the Fox Business Network today when asked about Washington Post columnist your Marcus Yogi Turkish officials believe the Saudi dissident was killed earlier this month after entering his country's consulate in Istanbul\nThis outbreak and the fact that it was so surprising in my opinion is proof the diseases are evolving into the FDA NBC ABC or having a hard time keeping up with the evolution of diseases down I Would tell you that bacteria\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the biggest problems we're facing right now as a nation\nBecause many people are getting MRSA another problems or a flesh eating disorders\nBut a warning went out about\nThis increase in\nAh the AFL bitch a cute or flashing my light is\n\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen\nAnd a worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from the why it's happening all the cases that were announced exceed you are being confirmed and twenty two states uh surges babbled help officials\nTwo announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases they also wanted to raise awareness about the condition so the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms and sort of physicians can quickly relay reports of the potential illness to the CDC\n\nIncreasing cases are starting happening in twenty fourteen\nThe CDC was tracking this but every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is logging a spike of it the spike in this ... virus but it it's a ... the ... celebrating the spikes are significantly high right now\nI'm back in twenty Seventeen CDs as he reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to or they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed too bitter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty team will surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year\nSo and and the bad thing is is there is no treatment for it long term outcomes or a crap shoot\nAnd what happens is whatever this is you know and we were talking about things like eat clients that polite as we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system\nEspecially with a specifically the spinal cord\nNeurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such as viruses environmental toxins in genetic disorders among the cases under investigation\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year\nBut there were three confirmed cases in Virginia and twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset\n\nNow we know that medical science is continually\nMaking rapid advances we've got new medications treatments all these things are developed\n\nAnd they're introducing a rapid pace our with supply and demand I often come to play the possibility\n\nThat pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that the ... by the FDA or by the health organizations that our system for screening\nUh is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are vaccine screenings are superior than most but now can be argued that I after Jay consequences they're not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs you talk to the environment of vaccines kids are reactive them in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FDR anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug I mean we know our biological systems are constantly evolving\n\nAnd we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\n\nI mean like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and\nAnd of course the victims of people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometimes they evolve and adapt or certain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course it's kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't uh it it goes dormant for a while and that comes back with a vengeance but right now\nWe need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even out pays for I Believe the ease pain and suffering\n\nAnd I can tell you that it it appears\nThe failures of the passive given way to the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising him disease and biologically altered diseases as well\n\nNew problems of course in ... and this new paralyzing disease is harming our children\nAnd we know the accidents related to carry a medication in particular multiplied and we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says oh I didn't know you were the anti vaccine or they start ridiculing you\nBut just think about all the accidents that all the mistakes that have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all the ... would be a diseases that are coming on board now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the flock but\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to a new the new things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available\nMany things that they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build we'll all sorts of things that we just know the right things to eat the right things to do is write supplements that take the right drugs\nI mean\nI I worry now because uh I've heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them you know equine and several light is or giving them some sort of ah eastern equine suffer white as for some other a disease that affects\nThe spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nAlthough we are right now\nThe doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd give them an ... virus a polio and non polio internal virus that paralyzes them\nAnd so a word of warning that it just seems to me the diseases are evolving\nNow whether we're giving them the point where whether or not we're giving them the push is another story whether or not environment is giving them to push is another story whether or not\nDrugs or after Jenike artifacts or things of that nature pushing it but it just seems to be more and more\n... these cases seem to happen more and more in the flue last year killed eighty thousand people eighty thousand

think as we speculated last year the bio labs zip greeted these new super block superbug super diseases\nBob and it's something else we have a respiratory viruses now turning into an ... virus we have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous evolution we're going through an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you know pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public or ineffective drugs ineffective vaccines ineffective ineffective\nI after Jenike artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo it's no see votes no benefit at all and so this is why I I think it's important we should talk about this we should bring this up because I I think that a a word of warning should go out\n\nAnd if you I mean if you ever have you have a compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think of flu vaccine is for everyone but after when I read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually had a flu that evolved into something else\nI've been really really really

how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of a knee surgery and the show\nAnd then she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given that they would kill her off\nBy giving her an opioid overdose and see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing the propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen and uh and that's\nWhy it was done so tonight I wanted to bring on a friend of mine who\nI've I'm I'm not sure we weren't having had him on a long time been Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist nutritious and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional and skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients just graduated from ... University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work\nThe on air pharmacist nutritious hosted the bright side radio program ... talking to ground zero\nHey try and talk to you again I Love that during the show because you are so darn intelligent Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it get making them or treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off on the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose boy what why are they\nDoing off her twenty six for you I answer a pool according to his father you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea that uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to cap dispersion on others\nOr whatever their behavior is acting human body is hardwired to be addicted to substances as hard wired specially it'd be an ... substance that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are\nThey are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an opiate say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain was down regulate\nThe production of its own in dodging opiates and you'll in Athens become efficient like taking artificial opiates you'll end up being the fission which we'll put you in an deficits date and if there's a there's a pill that are right in front of you and be almost impossible to resist them\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farm Mr pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people that tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that or\nYour award you're awarded the state yeah you belong to say you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're ... you're hooked on August ... you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your compels me to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way that help people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth out you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile and it was interesting because ah I was talking about he was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nWho have gotten their pain pills taken away from them and they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd\nBe more than happy to do that get rid of their pain and the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and\nI was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and then one day they just decided we weren't gonna give it to me anymore and so I had to use heroin and I'm going wow you know and and I I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation is absolutely terrible situation they as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not physical him it's a psychic pain to to ... pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a spiritual pain on Hanks and I ... I Believe as a pharmacist and this is a really big part of her or\nAn addiction problem is we are in hey we are such as somehow locked in a culture that role wars its citizens for being alive or just citizens were participating in society we live in ... and just ... culture and our and our emissions or just a symptom of it\nSo it it is is that there's something missing but doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the doping means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Delaney square is what when you get hit in the opening your brain does yes he like he was offering it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our nature to have this this yet the feeling whatever we want that\nWe get to get the feeling when we reach for the door knob and open the door\nOr you get a little hit a do I mean so we we have lots of things that we're supposed to be a ... a lot of the ways that we're supposed to be able to access his doping square as you say but we created a culture that that drives this and it's a habit in numbers the members of the society to live in the early yeah\nSo this is Shane\nAnd Lama trauma they they they induce the right amount of trauma and the right amount of time and people need to find that holds missing in their heart and their soul food like you say we were talking earlier about excess central paint this is something very real\nAnd something that I think everybody should be listening to tonight just to let you know the Connors airs tonight on ABC used to be the Roseanne show Roseanne and predicted that killed her off for using an opioid overdose\nTo kill off Roseanne once again proving that whoever is a conducting the uh the propaganda machine in this country they always seem to make people who OD on on drugs they may they they put them in this position of a moral failing and this is something I'm sick of\nTake for granted Sandy West why don't we take a journey back to this week in sports history started way back in the Eighteen sixties were the first professional golf tournament is held a press with golf club in Scotland a golfer by the name of really park\nWins the tournament this weekend Nineteen oh to the seven iron bowl is played for Auburn Leeds, Alabama twenty three to nothing in Birmingham today the Auburn, Alabama rivalry has had eighty two meetings\nIn Alabama leads forty five thirty six\nWith one time this week in Nineteen sixty seven major league baseball's American League both still allow the athletics to move from Kansas City to Oakland and expand the league to twelve teams in Nineteen Seventy one with teams in Kansas City\nIn Seattle [noise] this week in Nineteen Seventy four Chicago Bulls Nate German becomes the first in the NBA to complete a quadruple double twenty two points ... rebounds Thirteen and twelve blocks\nThis week in Nineteen eighty seven the first World Series game ever played in the coverage stadium\nThe Hubert H Humphrey metro dome and also the first World Series in which all games are one by the home team and this week in two thousand nine New England patriots quarterback Tom Brady had one of the best games of his career against the titans throwing five touchdown passes in the second quarter alone in the NFL record\nSix totally true in the game in eight fifty nine to zero route\nStature by heart radio weekends for each time capsule\nHigh were the Google dolls were fortunate that we can give our daughter's everything they need to grow and learn but not every child can focus on class has played a\nNearly Thirteen million kids in the U.S face hunger\nThat's one in six [noise] school lunch might be their only meal each day it's heartbreaking to imagine any child going hungry\nWe're dreaming a perfect day when kids can smile clay and just the kids without worrying about\nWhat their next meal [noise] Feeding America\nHere is a Feeding America network of food banks rescues billions of pounds of good food that would have gone to waste that food is given to families and children and me\nBeing the kids should be about doing things that make is ordinary to extraordinary learning to play an instrument building this than castle hosting Tea Party hunger should never be an obstacle to\nUp you can help in childhood hunger in your community I visited Feeding America dot org\nBrought to you by Feeding America and the ap count for\nHis time for you or T.

was the first drug czar in column and drug czar but he went on his ... marijuana we stay back in the Nineteen thirties and Nike or any member of the movie ... yeah I remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the nineties\nAnd he's actually turning twenty century stash civil war maybe\nAfter the stash American War of the ... are there are a lot of Mexican starting to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and ah this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to prohibit marijuana along with alcohol and we really complained about marijuana and nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a they\nCreated in the ... campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called re from Madison talks about all of\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nTax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nThey put a tax on marijuana and they said didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana is legal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jails are ill with people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created at least a police state around the around people\nAre just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana clause I'll\nTell you this is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd ah when I did and I was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and I never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the the feeling of ah\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something\nAnd I looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not gonna and he said no give it a try he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it was just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try Canada's and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know so ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about um things like a cannabis\nThat they've uh let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs in this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat a this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment\nThey they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and a and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities are for specialized treatments\nAnd I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained is going to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals were they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people who have gone through this because the problem is banned and you can agree with me I Know\nThe doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning but it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nBut it's felt physically but it's pain that is spelled on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained Al Gore hey don't work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people ask spoken to many people who say that they like things like ... and\nUh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar to what ... or biking than or Percocet\nBecause it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as thorough set and most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be alive they said well you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're\nAnd this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because it you know your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm or you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill\nThat's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe I'm an addiction to the smell\nKiss your bike down regulate its own natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out of balance but what's really interesting to me why and how much of the stuff that we talk about an exit central pain for example could be related to things like inflammation inside the body\nFrom too much sugar Yeah Yup or outwardly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know you take out of the diet completely one of the things that happened to get action you get to pry\nBut maybe there's people are suffering from the conditions fulfilling ever teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your\nDiet side of the information is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nWe limited empire quiet
