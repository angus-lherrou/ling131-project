I mean the attack is similar to the rice and\nBiological effects that happened before the cabinet decision was made it as I reported there would be a final blow\nEvent\nThere was certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um\nIt failed and and it didn't you know it was a biological scare\nOkay\nWhen I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks so I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the Alex Jones ... one day and for wars again and Alex asked me what is next Clyde what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're having a band that would start a war footing in the United states\n\nAnd he said I agree I agree well today I was notified of the attempted bombing someone sent an email that featured in October third at twenty Eighteen article from the Daily Beast and this was a headline said Kevin are could be the final blow\nFor Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow\nIs about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical these ... symmetrical attempts at a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the alphabet agencies and you can call it an inside job if you want\nBut in order declared a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be a suspect in order for the accusation stick and what I mean by that is we need\nTo see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect and so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this\nUh this is a bad day false flag if it if it's a false flag it'll okay it really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent me didn't blow up any one\nBut I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping ... how many gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have um\nA few people that are well you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very uh important people and you'll be hearing from men soon\nBut the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean\nWhat does happen today I mean like I said you can call it an inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that attacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and\nThis is what they do and the third world you know they just in third world countries and most of the time the suspects are always traced to rogue intelligence or rogue military actors\nI mean like the guy who um ... the for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think it was an ex marine\nBut yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors that do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military uh is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy and this is where the false flag starts to ... starts to materialize\nMean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy\nWhich is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hospital government or group so it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with government plot to eliminate military generals or even political leadership now if you recall the rice and attacks\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders and the latest bomb attacks are ... Democrats who are former leaders\nSo this is a tit for tat exercises his copycat exercise this is\nPart of the final blow affect it all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice it all started the you know and it it it it lingers\nBecause of the fact that there is is is Hillary Clinton said she said something the effect how can you be civil to a government and the civility we'll come back if you just allow us our positions in the Senate\nAnd Donald Trump says well no there's going to be violence if if ah no matter what happens to the violence is happening\nAnd I still argue\nThat if if we were looking in on a country doing what we're doing we would call it a civil war\nI mean think about it you got people in the streets that are fighting with one another and you've got you know presidents and generals getting sent poison in the mail you're getting pipe bombs and and I don't know if they were even capable of exploding when you get pipe bombs or what looked like pipe bomb sent to officials\nNow how are they able to do all the addresses of these officials were to send them and how to send them\nThere are a lot of giveaways here that tell me that somebody is not very bright and that it looked at some of the ... the ... or or the ... if you want to [laughter] whether the bombs below ups if you will or the ... that are there don't have any post mark on them\nAnd it's like how can you get a pipe bomb through um the male when we can't even get damn seat either are patriot on ... ... subscribers right Ron\n[noise] granted I have had such a heartache when we sent montage CDs [noise]\nTo our a patriotic subscribers [noise]\nBecause they never get to where they get all hatched up or eaten up I mean [noise] out of the pipe bomb ... true that that ... what I Want to know [noise] and how to get through with no postage housing and everyone know postage stamps or or whatever it doesn't make any sense to me\nWas all a crazy\nYou know everybody gets an adjunct Prague [noise]\nThere's a word I haven't used in a while agitate Prague [noise]\nAgitating propaganda [noise]\nWe have a life to live da de provide the lifetime of support helping veterans of every generation get the benefits they are entirely I'm a veteran but after I got out I spent two years along and home that\nDa de ... more than a million veterans so they can reach victories great and small\nBig Jewish family support to get back on my feet now I'm getting things right with my family\nAnd I finally admitted in my ...

our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes\nEven though we may disagree with them it's always been the case Americans even if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light the boat the EU's constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries a little over\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something that this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue with his balanced and ah\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nIt Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\nWe distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system is run we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a you know border divisions and things of that nature\nIt was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict\nThat one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut the establishment a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposing but none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day where martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment the symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed\nBy the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post as to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary\nStandards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there were major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and actually executed by a those in the deep\nState against President Kennedy\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one\nThe country would be in France in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimate they are and the illegitimate nation\nOf violence to solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about the state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst that this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow government is always\nBeen the dark commanded a ... a leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for false flag proof all we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\n\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis\nAnd chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering in the media today the only thing\nThat's registering as the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided\nIn their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive these were attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique Republicans are not unique\nIn the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there're journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent a journalist we've had a rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has written glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\n\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible for the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequel is selling out to the theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced us to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul when he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in the film they live\nCarpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nAnd appears to be some silent alien infestation echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that film\nHowever in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenter shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run amok\nThey have allowed believed to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThat the message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions but they're no resemblance to reality [noise]\nThe age of provocative tours create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and in others throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nTheir symptoms if part of or within the realm\nIn the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nWith the radio and ESPN Radio wherever you\nAre you storing baseball gloves
