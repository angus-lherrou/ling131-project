about Bob you've heard the board or was made primarily for contacting the spirits of the departed that apparently Bob had a hand in creating what kind of ah what do we call this for this is beyond a weed you board actually don't you think\nWell let me calling and talking board or spare board are definitely not a wage aboard it doesn't have the name we we as a trademark so we can't call the wage board but yeah I think ... or talking board or communication board is is just fine and and I liked the fact they named Bob ... was bumped board\nYeah it it belongs to him and it has ... we would that mean then that it has to he made it has a part of the ... minute and he could be you know his spirit could be in the board is that true or not\nWell I Love your opening monologue because you you would you address this really nicely um there there is no but he didn't make ... boards that are that are in viewing it with some kind of\nEvil demonic or even positive force their neutral they're just a chunk of ... in this case this board which I have on my lap right here in front of me um is made from a cardboard a decorated really nicely there is that there's nothing in it is just like a you know having a piece of paper in front of me there's\nThere's no energy or power to it but what happens in our own minds their own thoughts are on perceptions and filters and believe start creating some

the um nephew of Bob Bob Bob or we talked earlier with the um about his life and how we seem to have this\nWar and how we inherited it from his great uncle and\nYou were saying also that ah you know you have 'em and you said you have a schedule affective disorder\nAnd and you said and I was talking with a friend of mine and uh she was telling me about how some people when they're touched by mental illness some of them believe that they they'd been touched by the spirits in other words they have just open contact at all times\nAnd I was just curious if you know you said you use the board and you said you had contacts with friends who have passed do you believe that outside of the use of the board that perhaps you get messages are you sometimes get word from either friends who have passed or maybe even some of the victims of Bob\n[noise] I think you know the the main thing they say when you in schizophrenia is that if you have it\nAs a child that's the worst kind that I didn't have it as a child and so I didn't get it wasn't until later that\nThe doctor\nYou know a number of them said that I had to affective disorder which is um characterized by a lot of depression and and kind of seeing elusive nations of things [noise]\nBut if you have if I'm On my medication it's not that serious with me so I Can't blame it all on that you know uh I I just couldn't tell you my intuition\nIs that it really is working 'cause I've I've I've talked to people I mean I I had I put it this way I had some celebrity people came to talk to me personally you know and I I'm just ... I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking [noise] and they wanted the board and one lady whose son committed suicide at the board she ... originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with ... you know what I made a color copy ... [noise] and\nSo I ... a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress ... son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend\nAnd I sense as a board\nAnd she said that she had spoken to him Peter and thanked me and she is a very famous she's dead now I can mention of you if\nYou don't you go ahead who was\n[noise] was she was from that Dick Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind\nRosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore Oh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke shattered show on her own show who's Mary Tyler Moore\nNow [noise] but she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is it's so in other words what I'm saying is it's not just the evil you can you can deport all does it you know the channel what you want I think Bob [noise] was naive and he put\nHe put this together to talk to his victims and then you didn't realize they're gonna come they come back\nAnd haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my grandpa was it was it was in one day and then a month later he was in the town another town and then it caught up to them and that's um I think that's why he just and it kills up so he drowned himself\nAnd his body was ever found\nNo but he sent my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note that it was typed because he never would write and free hand I'm never rode anything down and you were type it or you stencil [noise]\nWhat did he say to me what was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the\nThe the stress that he's being haunted he said he made a mistake by making the board and people haunted him that he is hurt\nAnd then he he went into a New Jersey a beach town\nAnd walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter and no one ever saw him again so my grandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved it loved Bob for all his faults and he said that\nBob had a weird way of telling the truth about certain things so he was convinced that he walked into the ocean and it was in December [noise]\nAre you considering a safe to secure your

said the federal charges include making threats against former presidents and other officials as\nAnd they sent a letter along with it with the board and sent it to 'em they'll set of copy that letter to the Boston Globe so it was published on but also the president sent a letter back and he wrote back and basically thank them for the which board\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity but he said that he will hardly think I shall neatly tested power disclose the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spirituals movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada\nWatson right from the United states to\nTheir own version of the leader board and so they started making boards in Eighteen Ninety two and the rest is history and sell aboard such as Bob board which again falls into that category as talking boards\nA lot of sports after College of what makes it a prominent glass into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spirituals knew that was going to take time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a\nBoard and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned you know if people didn't make around and start customizing assign um um but the degree of this type of story no I have never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards\nAnd it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money I there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nUm and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted a legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is the avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean and and since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color a Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy\nUsed to work for a car and a fair which is an old TV show or\nOn a which has only channel five or something right in the east and um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like them show he did like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nLike the same image to same exact you know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing\nWith boxes and everything you know\nIn the in the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they\nPut it down so they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very\nAnd I tell people you know not to I'd I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old\nBecause this is real this is really happen this really works and it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody it was called go to the same place at the end but says some bad people\nThat are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back so I always say that it's not a joke ...\nNo I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some I have criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use aboard a long time was beyond its use the board um gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards crew rudimentary like that even even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really do need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of their uh you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves to pour just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into the able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six cents ... started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taking the Broadway I can still do this work and pay a lot of people ... and the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now that use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor seek to start bringing in the information and so again I might be real clear the board does know negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean people scared us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre do they they they think they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and it's a deal motor responses are that are based basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIt's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body and the brain are big transmitters and so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip in a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to do a medium that would\nAh would he would do his thing he would just scribble he\nWould take the pencil and he would just scribble on a no bad and it just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason he just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else [noise] and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are you using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the city of motor response but certainly is an interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and\nA comment on the program who is the director of the
