I just searched high and low all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists these dark clusters living very alien armada think they're an alien formation

do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full world wide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott Reed emails me all the time and he kept mentioning this story about or have you seen this video this video is going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform even military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory 'cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but\nUm there are rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred last night and the cheap rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube relief that purported to show a man in uniform announcing that\nSomething large he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nAs I said I was notified by email and Scott if you're lifting please send an email again and I want I Want to know if you send an email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know you are I'm Talking right to you\nI Want to know where that video is about man or that that footage of something hitting the moon\nBecause from what I understand is that they shut down YouTube last night they shut down YouTube last night because of that video they didn't want that video to go\nViral so they had to shut down the system see they won't tell anybody what system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow eight I Can't find proof of this and if I Can't find a video\nOr if I Can't find the story about the armada and a stark clusters and the Russians and the are the story\nIt all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nMaybe got linked out it wasn't supposed to be heard or ... or or thought about right so\nThe science fiction misinformation maybe maybe somebody straight to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really or was it really science fiction this information really because of circumstances it just seems a little odd Russians say they see me star cluster say but they don't want to start clusters they looked like do you remember the famous than you might remember me saying this on the air\nSo I was talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia says ... looked like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find that\nQuote [noise] but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did say it\n\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious as a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact I Want to check my email the series on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's writing back immediately\nUm see no he hasn't

before you to shut down and took it off please share\nSo the rumor is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to have struck by something\nOr he didn't say what it was he didn't have ... people say they thought it was like it had a hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut down\nOkay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified by an email\nA guy named Scott who\nTold me I got to go back and see and so my email or Scott told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he said it to me like five six teen\nOkay okay\nAll right so he said have you seen this video and and I didn't know what he was talking about All right so\nYou to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as a cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon thing\nOkay\nSo I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise] so\nThat's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down YouTube to keep people from watching it 'cause it was going viral\n[noise] now\nIt's like I said that sounded like a lot of science fiction disinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know what I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequency and it was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd\nThis armada apparently the sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations across the country now YouTube shuts down okay it's back up again today but all this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film\nIs that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive there are plenty of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening in the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use them as ten\nFailed the launch on its way to the I. S. S. according to a statement that was released by NASA but still use them as ten spacecraft launched from about ... or cause a drum and causing stun to the international space station of four forty ... am eastern daylight time\nThursday October eleven\nOr carrying American astronaut Nick Kagan Russian cause not Alex C o engine\nShortly after launch there was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nBut lunch appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted that ballistic descended above the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with a rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back\nBut the shawndra X ray observatory went into safe mode and halted all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure\nAccording to the agencies genres a transition at the same boat as possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope\nComponent in charge of putting in stabilizing the telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory they're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin hasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops uh offices\nTwo year old a two year old the organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to\nOvernight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars with no sixty million dollars I went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely would still uncomfortable an asteroid strike of climate is proportions\nThe White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan antenna to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have nothing to concern about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\nSecondly why issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario\nThat sounds too weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns\nRemember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty Eighteen and then all of this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before you leave invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us as it is it ... it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was really really bizarre all day to day a lot of tension in my neck a lot of uh I I couldn't concentrate\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then when I'm reading all of these posts saying did you see the video of the man in uniform stadium to the moon is about to be hit by something I said no it went all over the Internet\nQuite as what shut down on YouTube and I thought oh my God with a Shonda X ray telescopes shut down the

there's no uniform man that I see but is that the thing to shut down YouTube that's the question or something else that I wanted to remind you of something that uh\nThat you all this all these things are going down and we we talked about a Scientific American a story that indicated that\nSomething was happen something was happening in Antarctica is that uh I thought sound like good seal the deal

knowing exactly what these things are\nAre there high particles bitter blast they usually blasts through space it on the planet now they're coming out of the planet to go into the planning to go out of the planet and so these particles you know they make up what scientists call ... you know the standard model and these things break\nThe particle physics standard model and so scientists are going to this has gotta be something but it could be alien perhaps\n\nSomething alien you know it and they say this could be this means that or something is leaving behind a trail\nAnd unknown trail in it and I don't know if it's ... with some some guys will be fuel it's burning or what have you but since March or twenty sixteen researchers have been puzzling over to advance in Antarctica where cosmic

Mark you're on ground zero\nHey thanks for taking my call that a lot of sound bite a kind of sounded to me like an old dial up modem modem trying to communicate\nWell with no dial up modem it was a it was the the sensors that are picking up where they say is a rattle under a under Antarctica and that's what they are picking up it's rattled but some are arguing that what it is the wind blowing across the snow or the ice and that's why we're getting that sound and others are saying it may be from something else completely because\nThey've been receiving these neutrinos signals and they didn't know what they are so something is active in Antarctica something is active in space right now they're shutting down the telescopes and there and they've been they've they shut down YouTube for temporary period of time to get something they didn't want us to see went on in space last night was going on right now in space\nRight but uh yeah I don't think it was a mother or my or something else other than that and the train those uh that's like a radio reporter selected to me\nI was just bizarre I think it's bizarre that the that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while they it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in all the coincidental sums we're going on in the past three days\nBut I liked it off the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strengths\nIdaho anybody anybody can take the signal and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the stigma because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you'd get all these weird sounding side band voices going on\nSo or the you know wherever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spin upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they're saying it could be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust to create this type of\nAh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet and sounds like something you'd be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I I played it and I get I'm getting worried that when I play that I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block me from playing this I mean what's going on and kind of reluctant to play it
