H. ... makes you want you to finish up with Vicki Christina Barcelona their cover ...\nYesterday here and I think for a teeny but never stopped falling in love I'd like to shop for a martini all last friday at the east and north of tuning thanks for listening today\nFrom WXXI ... news I got the dos and this is connection\nA question to summer one last time you got an a bar fight [noise] have you ever been have you ever been in a fight at all this summer we're having a conversation about men boys and what it means when we say boys will be boys [noise] been a lot of talk about that lately\nJust because of the Kavanaugh here [noise] but there's a lot of conversation about what a reasonable expectations of the have\nFor boys and young men is simply natural the men will fight the men will throw a punch to special if they are fueled by al ... whereas a lot of social and can we change the time\nAnd our extra to have a conversation coming up I'm going to [noise]\n\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Windsor Johnston President Trump is delivering remarks at the international association of chiefs of police convention today in Orlando the White House says Trump will talk about the work his administration is doing to protect American communities and has pushed to secure the border\nNPR's camera Keith reports Trump will also take part in several campaign rallies this week to drum up support for Republicans headed November's midterms\nPresident Trump is well aware of the history the president's party typically takes a beating in the first midterm after he takes office Trump brings it up but just about every campaign rally saying he hopes to prove every one wrong one more time\nBy electing a Republican House and the Republican Senate\nThis\nWeek Trump has for rallies planned with stops in Iowa Ohio Pennsylvania and Kentucky each rally winds up being a combination of touting his own accomplishments bashing potential twenty twenty opponents\nAnd boosting his favorite candidates for Congress and governor camera Keith NPR News\nTropical storm Michael has strengthened into a category one hurricane the storm is on track to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle by mid week governor Rick Scott today issued a state of emergency for twenty six counties\nWe're stepping forward eight inches of rain as emerged might seem twelve inches away ... to both of the handle and ... which means funding will be a major issue is\nThe storm is located about one hundred miles east of ... Mexico with maximum sustained winds of about Seventy five miles per hour forecasters say it could come ashore as a category ... hurricane\nAttend shelter for use in the west Texas desert continues to expand as the Trump Administration struggles to handle an influx of migrant children crossing the border illegally as NPR's John Burnett reports the sprawling migrant camp is coming under increasing criticism\nI have not been in bars but I've not been in a fight I've seen fights yeah I got a quick story about that because my brother in law who was a ... a a a a the guys who guard the ... are down ... thank you [noise]\nUm when I was probably twelve or Thirteen and uh I can remember and he was a big guy and he was a broiler\nAnd I can remember like kind of a must be so cool that you get to these guys are beat them up and I have a Thirteen Years old on saying this to him and he's like twenty or Twenty one\nAnd he coached to be on this wisely you says it's not that cool somebody could really get hurt you could end up with a murder charge somebody get hit their head and I'm like\nOh like a ... foot and bars and so\nLucky I had some coaching right then because otherwise I Would have been probably part of that conversation\nBut let's fill it back why do you think at the age of Thirteen you had developed at ... at that point in your life up to that point thinking that boy fighting you know power is cool like that\nWell it's a ... that's ... what my groups who can take ooh and you know the person with the muscles you know got more uh at that time with it you got more girls you got more status you got more a better spot on the team there was a whole lot of\nSocializing going on that my brother in law challenged at least that won the fighting thing\nBut that's socialization still really really prevalent isn't among young boys definitely isn't it\nI I for I haven't in the last five years but the five years before that I worked in schools I'm so saw a lot of young men seeing some of these things even you know my eyes have been much more open to the last three years I have a three year old son\nA so even just seeing some of the socialization that happens with him at daycare daycares great I Love them I don't want to speak ill but just you know like he's he's a big kid you know they they've made comments like a well he's all boy and all these things 'cause he like boy quote unquote boy things you know trucks\nAnd are running around like a maniac and all this other stuff and it's like well you know there's we don't have to like put him in a box like you know they're like always definitely gonna be a football player well maybe maybe not I don't know I Know if my wife had her way he went because I've had enough concussions from that but\nYou know it's it's still the socialization is big he's strong he's gonna be you know take take charge and you know be the guy who runs the show\nI'm I'm looking at our phone bank\nHalf the lines filled up in five seconds when I met so we're going to get your calls in a moment here we've got to them earlier than we typically do because we already have so many which is a which is very very interesting um let me ask Ken why it is that that you think we are socializing\n... or you know what I mean let's give let's go back to Andrews email and just ask you you know what percentage of nature versus nurture do you think violence is because we know if you look at prisons men commit more acts of physical violence in this country that is true I don't disagree with that yeah that's that's just fact\nIn his email he does state but you know men are inherently more violent that may be true but we are thinking creatures the differences were not teaching boys to be emotionally intelligent we're not teaching them how to deal with difficult situation so that natural\nPropensity for boys as to lash out to be violent if they learn and they were of course learned it from their parents from society and their father specifically\nUm they don't learn how to how to deal with difficult situations in a constructive and productive manner that he\nThey lash out they just don't have the ability and unfortunately\nUh Darryl turnaround in many aspects there's a lot of single mom families out there and boys don't get the healthy masculinity to grow up in to help the men\nGet what do you make of of of that difference in someone like Andrew ... who am I really just try to stress that\nYou know that you're just trying to take biology of things here um what do we do about that especially if there is at least some natural difference um how do we discern the difference between the biological difference and the socialized difference\nI think that they and energy to engage with the world and if in physical ways and um\nAnd have that kind of like I Would call like strong energy around changing and protection that um is like such a beautiful element effort for many of the men that I I Know and love is is that fabulous energy and\nAnd it doesn't have to be channeled and destructive ways and it doesn't have to be channeled in ways that harm I mean you can be a very strong person you can identify with ... as a warrior for many for many good things not just for\nFor destruction it could be protection um [noise]\nSo I don't think I don't think it's a given I think it's a you know as look as said it's it's something that starts from that time that kids are very small and um\nWe're just chatting about a project we did a couple of years ago showing them ask do you live in which is a fabulous film on on um you know how boys are raised and the and that unbelievable pressure of socialization that um and that at the inescapable almost so\nHow do we how do we relate to that that that those social pressures and a good way and the other thing is you know how do we relate to\nHow much harm has been done 'em to two young boys and men at times also which often leads them to turn around and pass it on um I was looking thinking about coming over here this morning I was looking at at a recent piece in the New Yorker by Junot Diaz is an author\nA terrific author and on and he finally after years of writing about these ... these male characters finally acknowledge himself as a as a victim of sexual assault when he was seven years old\nAnd how much how much craziness and harm\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comes from our members\nAnd from ... a small batch ... brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what the ... available to go on line at cat ... dot com\nA good or bad change well I think that's a good okay uh no no I I I think that that I I I ... for those former days or\nWhen uh I think we're a little more tolerant of of of the eight years that I think we'll be having less and less a tower of behavior that's\nWell not dead center in in the you know that's that's I think we'll be talking with less tolerant of that that's not up to you is the norm\nOkay ah well I appreciate the phone call and I want to ask I guess what they make it that let's go round the tape jak well\nAh thanks for calling in Steve and um I see that maybe it has changed and\nI also wonder about what we're not tolerating as much as we used to tolerate usa tolerate it may be boys anyways\nAnd maybe a you know that's just how they are and but who's on the receiving end some of that bad behavior back then so I'm I'm a fan you mentioned earlier about\nSo that that's cool and that's for me is actually nonviolence and action right there the ability to take it and then look what's happening were telling the story on the air right now we wouldn't be probably doing this and talking about it even if he'd done what the habit energy would have been which was to just hit back\nIt would have been another fight in a gym class\nOne of probably thousands of takes place so doing that other thing which takes a tremendous amount of presents and strength is um you know I celebrate that\nOn top of the as you say that opens the door to all these other options that weren't going to be there if he would have swing back number one you could do nothing and doesn't have to do anything you demonstrated wouldn't nonviolent who's in the power of that you could also maybe find a coal moment to go meet with the skin sit down and say\nYou and they did and you know you got married and they did and then they can meet with other kids who might have witnessed this and say did you [laughter] I mean I I don't know Lucas I mean I I Will I Will get in return to my own experience\nI have never been in a in a bar fight I never really been in a fight I've had my head kicked against the locker one time by someone who was quite adept bowling game but he got me when I was\nLooking if I were seeing it coming would I've had the presence of mind like run his son I don't know what are you at Eighteen what do you think you would have been able to do that probably not a and\nAnd you know I was I I was kind of indoctrinated you know I was a football player wrestler and then played rugby in college so you know\nThat's kind of par for the course you know I can remember I think maybe one time I was like Thirteen or fourteen and got punched and kind of similar situation I didn't swing back because they\nKnew I Would hurt the kid but I might have held him down or something like that but\nI think this this young man that's the definition of what masculinity as is right there\nYou know when we really when we really talk about that and the words that we used to talk about men that's what a real man is is is being strong and you know I use the word before and I'll use it again the ... you know not not using our power or our control to be able to you know hurt other people\nI think just it's amazing the mindfulness and presents that he had in that moment and then it was a teachable moment for everybody afterwards\nYou know gave me this other kid be able to reflect on that you know if if you know her son had just knocked him out than it would maybe turned in this tit for tat thing\nYou know and I've I've said this a million times to people doing all the work I've done you know in my jobs over the last decade\nViolence doesn't really teach any lessons that just teaches you that violence will will that's violence just gets more violence so it's like physical discipline of your children you know beating someone up because they did you wrong or something like that it doesn't actually get you anywhere it just continues this cycle and it's going to come back\nEventually in some way shape or form on you if you do that okay jak\nYeah at that time I probably uh I wasn't necessarily known as any kind of fighter but I had I had a lot of backup friends and until somebody once told me about revenge some mentor because I\nBeen in a situation like that where I recruited revenge\nAnd so maybe not getting even in the moment this is around Fifteen or sixteen and just getting people to take care of it for me later and I had some mentor tell me if you want revenge you should dig two graves so that gave me something to think about ... regarding getting even\nA today on just a stunned and I admire the story from this woman about her son\nAnd a that this guy had the presence of mind to realize he didn't need to do what he had been to a well by the expertise that\nBrunner thank you for sharing that story and reminding us the power of a of withholding punch can have the Zachary in Rochester thanks for waiting ... go ahead\nYeah of course I Wish I had the presence of mine has a cat and um this subject hit very close to home I'm I'm a longtime listener first time caller\nAwesome and yeah\nAnd they say it's close to home because I feel I'm probably a really good example of where nurture overcame nature I was a very angry kit filled with a lot of rage and I know now that it was because I'm In my mid twenties I was diagnosed depression anxiety ADHD but at the time\nIt was just seen as I was just crazy little kid and\n[noise] like I I had I did my time and attention in school suspension and I didn't like it but\nI didn't know how to harness it if that makes sense [noise]\nUm it wasn't until I did do some organized sports wrestling a karate Boy Scouts where I had those types of mentors where it was seen as like you don't have to throw a punch you don't have to raise your voice you don't have to do those things you can do so in a way that's a lot more\nLet's say humane and that\nThat rage is still there I don't think I'll ever get rid of that but I have the tools now to be able to\nUh step over and overcome them and I think that's important\nBut Zachary let me ask you why that message worked with you and and here's why I ask it's one thing to say hey you know I I grew up I had a lot of rage ... violence was pretty common and then I was taught you know I don't have to use it that way\nUm there's a lot of people who could hear that message and not really believe it or or just think oh you know I'm I've been listening what can and jak Lucas have been talking about and that just sounds feminine and that just sounds a week that's on whatever whatever the stereotypes are for some reason that worked with you why do you think it worked\nReally worked with me and I know this will be the same situation for everyone but it it was because I got hurt\nAnd I got hurt very badly um\nYou don't mind a quick story I was looking ahead I prayed a as a ninth grade I was wrestling and I was sitting tired of losing\nAnd a couple of my classmates who are in the eye and the team with me they were also caught picking on me for losing so I decided to let that lost her out I intentionally got angry at this guy\nUm here's the thing I Won technically by pinning him but I lost\nEverything after that for three months I had a near constant migrants because of a neck injury that I didn't know I had at the time I ended up going through a bevy of different doctors different treatments and in that time I had to come and face the fact that\nYeah I Won but I lost and I lost because of my rage\n... [noise] well in in some ways it's a good thing it wasn't worse for you but to cause some people don't get a chance to learn that lesson\nUm but you got\nA I was just saying like I agree um\n[noise] and if\nI feel embarrassed when I like think back at that moment where I saw anger was the answer because\n[laughter]\nI could have saved myself a whole lot of pain and a lot of trouble if I just worked on it\nYeah but everybody gets to play it gets to lessons in the development of different ways and and Zachary that's a powerful story too and I really want to thank you for sharing that um and and good luck to you thanks for ... for calling in and in doing that for this program that's it's a great\nContribution to this conversation thank you and if I can turn next we're having this program you gotta you gotta thanks yeah go\nAhead if I could chime in a you know Robert Bly said was we all have this wild man inside\nAnd it's up to us from how we use it um this wild man can be an advocate and protect us and protect other people or he can be destructive it's all depends on the wolf you feed\n'em it's impressive it ... it's with this young man did when he was Eighteen and this woman son and and not fighting back\nBut his personal powers and the owner ability ... there's nothing more powerful than uh than being vulnerable because you have to stand there and show someone you're weakest spots in with them see it it's the most powerful thing you can do not too sure not to throw a punch to scream and you know\nYeah I I I'm thinking about you know a a ninth grader learning a lesson through that much pain [noise] um and I guess jak that's uh that's how some people will learn a lesson but that's the hard way to learn it oh yeah yeah\nNo thanks a that was accurate who's a group called yeah this is\nA I was thinking about self reflection because I didn't know until I knew and then once I knew no no no I Can't say I don't know\nSo the learning comes when it comes you got it at Nineteen the uh the the caller before Brenda in her son was sort of this ongoing anticipating what could go bad with these two boys are better to teach them how to defend themselves in the worst case scenario\nBut the learning comes when the learning comes in a I think that's the mission to stand up goes to try and keep getting that message out\nSure Lucas I mean there's no guarantee that someone like exactly would learned that lesson anyway I mean he may still he made a deal with the pain but still find themselves taking violence as a solution\nYeah and you know it's that story kind of hit home to me because I like I said I used to work in schools and I was the wrestling coach and have been like I said football player wrestler rugby player three of the most violent sports out there\nUm but I I've I've found for me there I think there's a big aspect of that at least the way I was socialize and a lot of men I Know that that team that bond that you need something and I've seen that [noise] there there was a young man who very similar to ... you know a\nLet me ask all of our guess I'll start with the young kid if if a parent is listening if a teacher's listening it is after all indigenous people's day um and the schools are off for the Columbus Day federal holiday or if they want to get to work the gun is two dozen schools et cetera what's the best way to get a hold of you\nJust jumped on our website um got Institute that ark and um and if we're not the right person to talk to you will\nApply to another direction we're not trying to be everything everybody gotcha Ken's don't burgers from the mankind project what do you want\nPeople to know about this kind of an opportunity that the mankind project provides and how they can get involved in\n[noise] you know a lot of our men are involved already in a issues with boys we have over sixty seven thousand men who've gone through our programs across the world\nUh I forget how many countries were in but it's\nIt's really important to teach perspective um to get boys to sit in a circle and talk about what's going on in their lives gives each of those boys or new perspective on the other person I'm circling up as a really powerful tool we do that with men\nUh we do that with boys out in the west coast um love to get it back here but it's been difficult to to gain some support of your voice work\nOkay and online where can people learn more about\nWhat your empty pie USAID dot org or there's also links to get to our local Web page from that\nAnd KP usa dot org I'm Lucas and jak understand the guy's program talking about some of the services here\nOkay a stand up guys program as we're mostly education advocacy right now we have some programs going on in the\nColleges and or whatever like it's currently domestic violence awareness month so we've been having some individuals speaking engagements\nOr what I think we really like to uh have is a change in definitions like what it means to be tough as a man what it means to be courageous as a man what it means to to have strength\nAnd um the\nRent is call earlier that was that was that was\nA redefinition of tough really tough to not hit back okay that's a tough and so I'm just some of the language\nOr adding expanding the definitions away from the stereotypes can look is\nYou know to what Jack said [laughter] working people contact to stand up guys by the way\nAt a resolve WWW dot resolved\nDot org ah then they can also contact a Delphi rise where I run a a domestic violence program for Twenty years so there's a couple of places\nVery good Philip right stress tests as a gay man in my fifties I've never been in a bar fight but when I was in my twenties I was beaten up by two guys while walking home from a bar one night they were driving by and stopped to attack me I wasn't doing anything but walking home at night\nTo provoke them David says I'm sixty eight did my fair share of drinking in my twenties I was never in and never came close to being in a drunk and fight I think that this is a matter of attitude in upbringing as are most of our decisions\nAnd a dentist rice just to say that he thinks that the traditional American method for raising strong young men has been nice three institutions have a nuclear family church and the boy scouts and all three seemed to be in decline and out of popular and political favor and I will turn to to Ken for some final thoughts on that what would you would you tell\nDennis Oh yeah everything is is right on the mark without it I've been involved in one bar fight but from the side of the police so I came in with mace and just like everybody else did and just to witness that violence that has no meaning\nUh uh\nTo see what happens to people walking down the street there used to be a a gang initiation where they come up behind some old person and whack 'em in the head and try and knock 'em out ... that's just insanity to me we need to change that there's there's all kinds of ways to address that but the most I think is emotional intelligence\nEmotional intelligence there's a phrase we've heard so often this hour from Ken stone Berg who is\nUh the area steward for the mankind project thanks for being here Ken thanks for sharing this with us and and I think as you said during a brief break let's do this again and let's uh let's continue this conversation absolutely thank you very much for being our thanks to ... the director of the gun he has to do it for non violence is always nice to see you can thank you so much appreciate having\nAn stand up guys from resolve jak rented can Lucas ink thanks for taking the time guys thanks for being here and thanks for based stand up guy who are very welcome Evan thank you thank you I haven't got a [noise]\nI Know there was a lot of female and feedback on this and a lot of different directions to take it so I don't consider this the final word on the subject as a lot more to say and well see that in the future short break more connected to come in [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views express do not necessarily represent those of this

NPR News New York\nThe major league baseball playoffs continue with three games today NPR's Tom Goldman reports Houston any LA Dodgers had a chance to clinch their opening playoff series\nThat you learn less [noise] yeah I mean I think there's a lot it's a very dynamic industry and there's a lot of it's very multifaceted I think some of the big takeaway as we're kind of you know keep your mind open ask yourself how your view in ... commercials and ads in marketing how do you feel about these things\nIf you become a see our an executive how are you going to lead your people to come up with these new ideas keep everything young and and ... and you know make sure you're really catching the societies I first specific tasks and things that you're trying to target okay maybe\nI had two major takeaways um she thinks I didn't really recognize you're going to be as big of problems as they are when I was kind of graduating coming into the industry the first one thing the political climate that we're facing as advertisers and\nHow kind of brands are being forced to face that and take a stance on political issues and that's it's terrifying like that's something that's been taken poorly I'm In the last couple of months and we're going to have to continue reacting to thing what do you mean by just been taken poorly ah for example the Nike ad that recently came out um that were kind of\nFocused on the black lives matter movement you know they had a very liberal audience that took that well um and then they had another audience that burns their products ah\nBut it worked it I mean we are ... prices seem record I absolutely but in the future will that continue to work can brands continue to act that way and I think that's an interesting issue that we're facing um especially you know us coming up in this time where\nWe have to we have to confront that stuff yeah that's a really\nInteresting point that I mean probably were is worth a little more exploration we're gonna come back to that because I hadn't thought of ... just how much brands probably have wanted to stay a political and the sort of the forced I'm kind of pigeon holding your breath release forced to take a stance will come back then the second what else stands up\nThe other thing that came up a bunch was how terrified the ad industry as is of us as Gen Z they're terrified of us they don't know how to reach us and I went to several panels about reaching Gen Z I Am Gen Z and I just thought it was so interesting they're so scared of the way that we react to them\nWhy do you think they're scared because they think that you don't consume any advertising it all\nWe don't want to consume advertising and we're demanding so much of them we ... we demand that they need us where we are we done that that they act the way we after they communicate that we the way we communicate and they don't know how to do that they're terrified\n[laughter] them scared of Gen Z that's interesting uh Daniel what did you take away from the week\nI mean in one sense of something very similar to Abby or where they're kind of scared of ... there but in a in a bigger sons I felt like I Would certainly they really all the ads really pushing authenticity they feel like if they do want to connect with the younger generation they catches do these broadcast messages\nLike I mean Apple's Nineteen eighty four out it was like a really groundbreaking ad but every day is just sort of like ... ads\nAnd like our generation like will not lost on my parents were mute them my dad will change the channel and like me like I'll just like I don't even know like I'll just don't even watch it on my block on what the things are so what they're what they're presenting us was that they really need to like\nEnsure that their ads are very authentic and they feel like something that if they were watching it they connect with it like out of personal level and brand like one day as where they were talking about like how they were ... and how they were like trying to make their brand feel like a person to people so authenticity to me it was like one of the big Sam's\nDid it work for you to the one who's the wind is yeah I Love the way they released a mix tape I mean they've got great Twitter says yeah exactly [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah Wendy's released they mix tape on super viral like in March on the charts yeah I was on one of these mixed wild but now I'm In line with their personality yeah because Hamilton and when do you [laughter] [laughter] okay it was awesome and the other thing\nAbout like the completely opposite side of the coin is for me as the ... security major I'm very concerned about keeping tabs on my data but I'm a big move in the advertising industry of like day to day to day like we need to get all of the data they're collecting data\nTheir companies are collected at every time you like basically open locations are on your phone\nThere is a company that logs or data puts it on a map\nAnd an stories like which stores you go to one of those stores are busy like\nFor every location basically in the United states there's spectrum for example of a record like all of your data like every time we watch and they kind of venue and market specifically are people you can buy ads based on like a certain demographic are trying to target and it's wild the whole industry has become really do driven\nAnd analytical in a way that I didn't really know was wow okay sorry professor\nThese guys are pretty smart [laughter] these kids are pretty smart I think it's you know this is a digitally or you know this is the the gyms each generation you know there's usually native since they were born so this is a a generation where you can't fool them you know this is a generation that\nThey're looking at this traditional advertising set up and they're saying you guys have to sort of be cool with us and be very transparent we'll see how you feel about stuff you better be good in terms of just being a company rather than just selling a product um they're not going to be sort of swayed by the easy way of just you know look over here and here's a shiny object\nThey really are going to take people to have to do something serious and that's why you know in the Catholic thing came out\nThey loved that not not just because they were approved of what he was ... was doing but because of that company had nerve enough to stand there and say this is how we feel\nThat's how deep they want the transparency to be with companies and I think as that continues to move on it's going to change advertising a little bit because you know they're not swayed by the song and dance through more swayed by\nWho are you what are your values and if your values are up to to what I think are admirable values with I totally agree with them or not\nI might actually buy from you which is sort of an interesting variation on what used to be the the formula\nYeah and so um alternative to our listeners you can email the program connections WXXI excite dot org you can call us would love to hear um you know sort of building on what you're hearing from the students from all righty about that we do do you want your brands to be political do you want to know and this may split along generational lines you know some of our older listeners\nSay like I don't want to know her out and some Jersey and younger millennials I'm might say no ... matters to me it's a four four to nine five talk it's toll free for four to nine five eight to five five or to six three of us are if you're in Rochester to six three\nNine nine nine four I Want to kick it back to add to it because you brought up the Nike making sort of a stand a political statement\nWith Colin Kaepernick as the leader that brand\nI can trust that to Pepsi using one of the genders and I'm really Columbus only a ... in instead of taking an authentic issue that's tough Pepsi kinda tried to kind of\n... distill or water down this notion of protest and co opted for their brand I don't remember which general was in there um it was highly [laughter] I Can't give him I don't [laughter] I mean again I I never know the model [laughter]\nBut anyway the advocate for a year or two old now but that was a disaster right and so um so if from your perspective if they're going to go into\nSensitive issues political issues et cetera\nUm I imagine you'd better be authentic you better not be seen as sort of co opting something\nDefinitely I think Pepsi's big mistake was that they weren't taking a stance on an issue they were saying our product transcends the issue and we don't want that we don't want a product that transcends issues we don't transcend the issues we live them daily there's so many\nStressful political things going on at every given time and it's been that way since we were in\nSixth grade like politics have been at the forefront of our lives so we don't want\nWe don't want brands that say well I have a Pepsi and calmed down and we want brats say we're Nike this is what we believe\nWe're with you and if friends aren't willing to do that they're going to lose a lot of their gender the audiences depending on their political views that's another big issue is it's it's two sided at this point and if they're picking the wrong side who knows\nOkay well I Will say well when you hear ... the listeners if you want to feel old I'm the oldest millennials are now almost forty [laughter] and I know every home everybody sort of you know [laughter] rentals at the notion of\nUm um strata find generations by name but I'm ... minutes ... your generation which starts and I don't really seem to twenty four year old sixteen uh twenty four now Gen Z so I'm I'm curious do do you agree that the Pepsi flopped with the ... or\nI I definitely agree um one of the biggest things actually as authenticity especially for Gen Z I'm actually Steve Martin spoke at one of the seminars and he mentioned you know I don't like\nA showing our philanthropic site or you know ... piggybacking on specific charities because our we truly authentic about it what does it actually mean to us\nAnd where does that line where does that line end up being do do we go for it and and show what are what our thoughts are or should we step back and just be the brand that does what we do and do it the best you know there's a there's a very thin line between\nBeing authentic and saying guess we followed this idea and we have the stance on politics but are we pushing it on ... where are we just saying you know in a watered down way that we think this or we showing you improving it to you\nKnow and so let me ask all of you and again professor you got to go last 'cause you're still going to see how they're doing on this question I'm I'm very curious as you look at what's just take the capital dad's from Nike\nUm [noise] the range of feedback on that you did a line ... politically I think that's fair to say but I'm curious to know how you individually look it advertising if it's going to take a stand\nI I take that point Daniel I Will say there's more conversation than I ever heard when I was growing up about source\nAbout again everything from supply chain to carbon footprint those conversations almost never happened on the consumer level when I was growing up and to your point I'm sure everyone can do better the one thing that I think social media does is it allows\nOr ... it does not allow companies to sort of fudge it you cannot present a false face 'cause you will get found out\nAnd I think the backlash is a real risk because I suspect your generation is not going to tolerate a false a social responsibility front 'cause 'cause if you say it matters to you\nIt what you probably want to someone who are companies that are socially responsible Macs are indifferent and the worst are people who claim to be responsible but are doing things terribly you know and I would think there is a big penalty to pay for that I think professor that's a good\nThing yeah no I mean just to sort of build on what you're saying is they have access now this is the end yes generations so companies to them don't look monolithic at all they look like it's a relationship and if you do something wrong these guys find out about it in the reaction comes quick\nSo it's going to be tougher I think for companies as they go through the years to come and see how that relationship works out and problems happen mistakes happen but there seems to be sort of a cold\nYou know cooperative sort of relationship going on we're don't worry we see what you're doing we understand there was a mistake you'll try better next time or something but that's not going to change with access increasing and be and people being able to the moment something happens get on the Internet and start talking about something and making sure that everybody else knows about it\nAll right Bonnie in Rochester next on the phone go ahead Lani\nYeah Hi a couple of things one is um I think in the especially the earlier days of social media on Facebook and all that I I never hit them being made mainly talking to themselves about themselves\nAlso others if people who are in the public is it all as though it's kind of a this is a you know it's an extension of our family we're going to talk of this and that whole that whole of approach sounds kind of nice looked like over well we have the\nYou know as your neighbors not to take you off and on and really if you you thought about it at all and now it's obvious both those examples especially if you read there all your writings about themselves they really have a huge corporate\nMentality um and they uh yeah that kid who are they really want to take over public transportation and all that has some very serious consequences jobs and everything so I think they ought to be careful\nThat um things that seemed kind of fun and interesting and I would add another piece of that similar thinking is that all the different kinds of technology if you take it as a big pile um\nSome of it is it to a feeling and so I see a little bit late last of the other side too you know automation of everything else kind of push back\nBut it's still not enough and I think that's a really critical the so if you have a product\nThat you know it's got to replace people you know what is your position going to be on that and I think too much of that is partly why we have a president we have right now\n[noise] Bonnie thank you very much that last point you know it's sort of an extension of what I was hearing from Abby what do you make of her points there about you know understanding what you what your product what your company is doing and the and the impact\nI mean I think you have to be careful and you have to you have to understand what you're doing before you do it now you can't kind of I think a lot of marketing especially what even I learned when I came into college is a lot of like test it see if it works you can't test to see\nYou have to know you can't claim ignorance ... ... yeah he can't claim ignorance you can't you can just little things test as a post on Twitter but you can't test a campaign like Nike and he put out\nYou have to [laughter] Pepsi ... general neighbors had nobody had a conversation did any gender folks will get in the room there and say should I don't really know turns out that day for us yeah honestly I mean I look at stuff like\nThat and I wonder you know I I think what I'm hearing from these you can't tested can't roll it out kind of without knowing right but privately I sure hope you're\nTesting your [laughter] [laughter] yeah you know and so go ahead\nAnd I mean I actually experts at a company um ... textbook company and they focus group like everything we when they had and turns over the summer like half of my job is just doing focus groups I wasn't even like an intern in like a marketing department so they were just pulling it like every intern they're like we need young people like please help us we don't know what's going on\nAnd like companies are really in a panic right now about this whole generation and\nThat was the most of the services that they went to they finally said you should just create like a group of people that come into your company every now and then there are like sixteen and Seventeen and just ask them what they think about what you're doing 'cause it's it's the probably the most directly to get the information you need a well\nI'm waiting for only break

[noise]\n\nThis afternoon at four welcome back to connections doesn't do a tailor students are already too was just telling us during the brief break that among the many different sections in New York City for a week twenty Eighteen there was a lot about women and women's place in the industry the impact there tell me what you're do you took away from last week\nAnd there's a lot I could talk for for days on women and industry um it's a tough topic certainly in today's climate I'm One of the things that's really changing as you know Miss America to point out is is coming out soon um it's all about rebranding the situation and making it known that\nUm women in industry are just as strong as men and making sure that the the environment there is equal and really that\nUh women in politics swimming in stem women in in any career can really bring a lot to the table it's a new perspective it's a bright idea young women older women um and really just not to not to put those voices down a we have a lot of ideas as as a you know as a group of people and\nI'm just make sure everything is inclusive and and all inclusive making sure that\nWe have our sat on the table as well as was talking about a lot at advertising leak I'm\nI'm ready for instance oh Webster CEO of walrus in a panel called running like a girl\nA says that the women drive over Seventy to maybe eighty percent of purchase decisions we are the most powerful consumer group on earth having women ... represented in the cease we'd just makes sense but we have a long way to go do you feel welcome in the industry of you ended up in this kind of an industry\nUm I definitely feel like there we are paving ways we are making the pathways that we need to get there I think there is a lot of work to be done and right definitely heading in the right direction but as of right now women are still fighting to get that start at the table that we deserve and I mean we're not going to stop 'til they get it so\nLook out [laughter] how do you feel I feel lucky to be alive at this time um I\nThink that a lot of doors opening for women I think a lot of it too is just kind of\nFaking it until we make it so I have lived my whole life that all righty this way I'm just gonna keep acting like [noise] I Know as much as an 'cause I Do and I think the recognition for that kind of follows um I think the advertising industry is very open to women open to diversity\nThe cc not mine but come in and there are rising in the ranks so um it'll be interesting to see what happens in the next couple of years that\nI Want to ask you to be an below what they think is the consequence of not having women either in the sea sweet or just in general as part of ed team's et cetera and I think for example of I'm Nineteen eighties movies now and the last month or so in this country we've talked about\nWhat it when we look back at some of the things that were just laugh lines date rape played for a laugh lines things like that uh it was very common in the Nineteen eighties I mean sixteen candles had it as a central plotline and at the end of that film and it was just all joke", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan
