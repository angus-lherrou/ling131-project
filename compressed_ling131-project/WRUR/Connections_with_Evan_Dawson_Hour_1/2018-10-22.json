of newspapers across the country are seeing cuts cuts the staff that have come pretty regularly there are all kinds of whispers about what happens in the future cubs front runner up for his entirely\nNo that doesn't mean the Democrat in front of who's going away tomorrow anytime soon and we certainly hope not but there is a new print publication in Rochester aimed at providing stable valuable journalism into the future digital only in just launched it's called the Rochester beacon who's behind it\nWould have the goals of it will you read print on line [noise]\nAnd after all those ... votes behind the beacon coming [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh White House advisor Jared Kushner says the Trump Administration is still in a fact finding mode concerning the killing of Washington Post columnist Jim ... and it's not yet ready to discuss their response to Saudi Arabia\nNPR's Scott Horsley reports president Donald Trump complained in an interview about quote deception and ... and the Saudis account so far\nJared grocer was pressed on the Saudis credibility during a CNN forum in New York City uses the administration is still gathering evidence about ... killing from a variety of sources and then ultimately it'll be up to President Trump to decide how to respond\n... stress the Saudis have been strong I was in the administration's efforts to contain influence over on\nThe middle east is a rough place it's been a rough place for a very long time and we have to be able to pursue our strategic objectives but we also have to deal with obviously what seems to be a terrible situation\nThe presidential son in law has formed a personal relationship with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin ... mom ... says he's urged the British to take this situation seriously because he says the world is watching Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nWell a Turkish state run news agency is reporting now the police have sealed off the entrance to an underground car park where of eagle belonging to the Saudi conflict has been found\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and his body guards are implicated in cars show genes disappearances suspected murder the Washington Post columnist was last seen some three weeks ago when he visited the Saturday constantly and assemble\nAfter initially denying knowledge of the dissident journalists whereabouts over the weekend Saudi officials acknowledged his show jeeze death\nTheir story is if a journalist dying in a fist fight inside the consulate in that Saudi hit men loyal to the crown prince had nothing to do with it however Turkish and other governments say they're not buying that story\nPlan this we sort of decided we'd think it through and take a look at what we thought were some of the complex issues and\nRochester where people were talking about and those were some of the ideas that bubble to the surface\nAnd I don't think that um you have to look very far to see that they are on people's minds are what we are trying to do at the beacon is sort of give back the onion take a deeper look in depth look but at the end of the day I think what we offer at the beacon is\nUm informed\nOpinion in our community a voice these like if a member of the community is writing to us on any subject that they see\nA deserves attention um that it's fact based\nAnd you'll find that from our writers too that we will approach every story looking at a taking it a step further and looking deeper and so whether it's health care um or whether it's a innovation education\nYes it is a broad spectrum a and most of our rewrite really will be subject as we understand and recognize that journalistic uh objectivity is is kind of unattainable in a way\nI'm so we will be trying to have personal connections where appropriate to a story for example I'm In a story that's coming up is ah my journey as an immigrant and immigration as an issue that's riveted the nation um and I detail\nHow I came to this country and hopefully through that see where the immigration system is broken\nAnd um and how I navigate it true that\nUm there are other pieces that are coming up that will also take a look in that way but it's all based on facts and numbers and information that you can count on\n'em and make decisions accordingly so hopefully we'll be trained to do really do is drive public action and uh which is why I got in the world is the ability to help Rochester Richard my home\nNow and I'm also a right pieces that I couldn't write 'em at the paper as much as I wanted to\nWrite and Kent Gardner of the opinion editor what is the goal of an opinion I guess I was gonna say section ... essentially a section for publication like this what do you want to bring to this publication while\nI think we think that the uh [noise] the the the\nThe real estate for a lot of people who express their concerns about about issues of significance for the community is a is too small\nAnd so there are issues that we we often are familiar to people in the community so you know this is something I really like to write about whatever we really know where I could place it\nWe're kind of like working I express my opinion the way that you know people will pay some attention so we're trying to build is a public square they'll do kind of a community water cooler around important issues in for example this weekend but just before\nOf your show started a NPR was talking about the Janice decision\nGoverning public employees union so when we this week are also going to be talking about the ... decision I'm uh I'm doing a statistical piece on trends in unionization\nAnd then we have to um opinion pieces submitted by people with different perspective some ... from Rochester Teachers Association\nAnd then ... from the empire Center for state policy with different perspectives on the impact of the Janice decision we think there's a great need for that and on the you know so that that's a a task I've taken on I'm I'm you know reaching out to people in soliciting pieces from people and we know are are responsible I'm\nA voices and I'm also asking people who have interest in expressing their positions on important issues to to confront us\nRight it's Rochester begin to kinda official launched it was when Alex [noise] it was a Thursday on Thursday so let me just ask some sort of nuts and bolts questions then we'll get into some the meat of some of the initial writing I see the phone rang and listeners you've got questions or comments about this new digital publication\nIt's them [laughter] aid for four to nine five talk eight four four to nine five eight to five five to six three W ... fewer Rochester to six three\nNine Ninety nine for how many people on staff at the beacon Alex so there are seven people were seven people and your print or your prints your publication schedule I Know looking at your publication schedule is going to be how often\nSo uh each week a we're going to have a well edge each weekday and reality we're having at least one new peace uh that's going to be published a so there's something new to read every day\nUh we're also going to have a weekly schedule where we are basically combined the work that we do each week and send a things out to people as well so they could either read it kind of on their own or or read it or or as they get emails uh if if they wish to each week\nYou're paying your staff\n[noise] um not not yet uh we we do plan to be [laughter]\nIt's ah I I mean certainly our expectation is that we will be a a focusing our our finances uh quite a\nQuite a bit on and making sure that what we're paying for mainly ah is not so much paper et cetera but it's it's a ... it's going to be a wouldn't be paying for for actual or journalism or and so we know right now we have a three year a plan that we put together\nA but what's really kind of you know I think special and unique about what we're doing\nOr is that our our goal is to be a were were nonprofit our goal is to be here for the long term our goal is to make sure that though we're going to be putting out there uh for many many years to come or things that are that are useful for the community in terms of being a public square et cetera\nUh and so from our perspective and we're certainly going to keep working every year to make sure that we have the uh the the financial wherewithal to to be able to uh uh\nSo I ... well sure I'm ... yeah I think the decor sponsored it's an interesting case to look at 'em both because of the success of it but\nIt's actually a for profit but they use a membership model as well in other words the site is open\nBut they ask people to contribute a certain amount and I think you know certainly in our a near term thinking that's the kind of models are worth thinking about it we don't have you haven't had any discussion about closing down are citing any fashion having a pay wall but yes\nWe're a nonprofit um and we did a lot of thinking about that whether we should pursue this as a for profit a nonprofit ... you know\nA lot of different ways of doing it but um we chose non profit for a variety of reasons and among them was it was the best way to really build abroad community based publication we don't want to be closing doors to people we want to be opening them to allows much participation is possible\n[noise] yeah I mean that does sound a little bit of like a WXXI experimental to be honest parliament and we we just had to fall membership campaign listeners by the way I'm instructed to tell you and I'm really grateful to tell you that we see that our goal or for the week and thank you for that\nAnd yeah in many ways um that's the model that I think is most sustainable for journalism into the future to let people know if you want this you can keep it\nUm and the right well I'm not really too you will keep it one\nOf the reasons we opted to go that route is because there is really a movement or in that direction we're I'm an associate member of\nA I N n the Institute for non profit news which now has closing in on two hundred different members including a ProPublica and there are a lot of resources that we can get from um I and then but it's it's just there's a recognition that if you're going to build a sustainable model and and something that\nCall [laughter] somehow won't come back after\nExperiences and um you know as as a journalist you tried to do your job and if the powerful doesn't want to sort of engaged at is up to them and then readers and listeners will have to decide what to make of that but um we will be reading and I think Martin's question\nIs it fair one when it comes to welcoming different opinions I just to follow up on pulse point\nThere is um [noise] I I kind of a debate or even a limb polluting of of of both sides is a ...\nYou know this notion that we have to be so careful to get all points of view\nThat yes we are going to do a piece on immigration but you know I'm sure you're also going to make sure white nationalist get their point of view out there too I mean there's lines you have to draw right from at the end so eventually you can't have every single view on every single issue because some\nI think you have to sort of make a value Judgement are you are less important or even potentially harmful and that's also fair to say\nSure but um if we could go [noise]\n... a ... in that sense I if somebody is trying to make an argument our state their case\nI Would like to see how they came to that argument with walk fast yeah then why I'm so if it's just a rant um then no I'm yes you're right there and then I'm inclined to say no but if they are if it's supported by facts and evidence I'd take a second not\nBut other than you I mean I think you allude to the tendency for on for some media outlets to um make sure that they have balanced a balanced perspective so if you've got a Ninety nine people on one side of an issue in one person the other side of the issues they want to make sure that that one person gets represented well that's kind of nuts\nUm at least in my view that as you've you've Ninety nine percent of the ... of an ... well informed\nUh individuals have a particular perspective I think we're kind of willing to take that as can sense\nYeah I ... in ... but let me also because the the easy one to point to as well cable news for years had ... vaccine an anti vaccine some or you know and so obviously that's an easy one to kind of target but I'll give you one that that will probably come up\nFor a number of different reasons reducing tax burden on western New York is a particular is probably a good idea for you know you want people to a movie or you want people to have more of their disposable income you want that circulating the economy so you can make a lot of good arguments I think in many different ways for tax cuts on different levels\nWhat you really can't say is cutting taxes magically increases revenue and yet we didn't really hear that all the time we see it published an op eds we see the New York times publisher\nMitch McConnell was telling everybody that the recent Republican tax bill was going to be revenue neutral or better now we're hearing we have nearly trillion dollar deficit and we're reminded that Republicans only care about the deficit if Democrats are in office and again I'm just observing historical trends of not trying to be partisan here because there are good reasons to cut taxes\nBut if you're the opinion editor and I said you'll be saying\nOur tax cuts are going to increase revenues\nYou know you're going to say okay I'm going to publish or you're going to say can you give me some documentation here\nYeah exactly then and that's precisely the point ... ... you know I mean that particular issue you pick on one that I end up having done and you know knowing a fair bit about talking a fair bit about you know there there is a a range of tax rates wherever that uh that magical thing can happen where you can cut rates and actually increase\nRow I'm sure you've got a Ninety five percent and you know top marginal tax rate I'm sure cutting taxes would actually you can actually\nGo back to the Reagan tax cuts I mean the marginal tax rate was really quite high and the Reagan tax cuts I think arguably really had that effect on the same thing for the Kennedy tax cuts in Nineteen sixty four\nUm that was something that Kennedy pushing and Johnson on a push through after Kennedy's death I mean there are times when that ... and then when that matters but but most the time you know arithmetic still counts that if you got a lower rates are going to last for him\nAnd so I think it's really important again to inform people about the complexity of issues we live in a really messy world and I think to pretend that the answers are simple would also be I'm I'm not really doing a service to the readers\nAll right and as a taxpayer myself listeners don't be deceived into thinking I'm not a fan of lower taxes I'm just saying there's different arguments to be made and I I it you found your head against the wall when you see the same argument on bad evidence so anyway\nThat's right and and you know you can't reduce tax ... there's a point at which obviously reducing taxes goes brings revenue zero [noise] um so anyway yeah it is these are complex issues and I think we are committed to attempting to um put perspective on on perhaps some extreme viewpoints\nYou know whether we publish an opinion piece of submitted to us that takes a position that doesn't seem to be supported I think that's where I'm pretty safe ground but if we were publishing a peace if we're asked to publish a piece of that takes a position but is a smear she suggested well supported we will push back\nOkay it's Rochester became dot com um let me grab one more phone call and this comes from Ed in Rochester go ahead\n[noise] hello I appreciate your show and uh\nI uh I Know Mr Gardner from another setting so um but\nI have two questions that have come up I'm as I've listened one is how how will you is that people who watch uh big contributors um seven people probably aren't going to put out enough content on over the long haul so you have to have a journalism\nTo ed and ed what's on what's enough when you say enough content over the long haul I'm not sure why seven people could put a I I just don't I Do to find enough\nI Would define enough as being a let's say\nLet's say you know so in the newspaper business you'd had might have an international stringer who is a reporting on let's say American uh influenced issues internationally but from an international perspective\nThey have to be located where they're getting the the local perspective on American issues\nThat's one question so how how are you a vet people or is this seven people it and no one else when except um [noise] opinion piece second question is how how how are you going to\nFight the fake news ah accusation each\nThat are polluting the discourse right now those those are really my too\nYou know how how you interview bring people on say okay let's get on the way we want to be a regular contributor and how do you fight the fake news all while they're just making that story I that's not actually true here's another murdered\n'em look at you know fairness to say and thank you for the phone call or and again his phone call if you're just joining us or questions for the staff members of the publisher the editor in chief the managing editor in the opinion editor from the new Rochester beacon a digital publication launched Thursday are all here I happen to think seven people is actually quite a robust or a bus staff\nThat can do quite a lot but he's asking about sort of vetting or or how you're going to decide who's going to contribute\nI think one thing I'm it might be useful to think you know who your who started talking about the print\nUm if you want to use the analogy it might be closer to thinking about uh magazines versus newspapers and think about you know something like the Atlantic in particular not only in terms of the general thrust of what we're trying to do but also in terms of\nThe staffing magazines typically have a smaller staff and reach out to a number of contributors freelance writers and such and\nYou know we obviously this is just a starting point we want to scale up and that's why we're going to need community support in in donations to help us do it but even with the people that we have to collectively have well over a century's worth of journalism experience\nWe can you know field a lot of articles and both writes them ourselves work with freelance writers taken contributing material from op ed writers and such [noise]\nWe can really scale up I think fairly quickly so ah and do it in the way that we will we need to in order to the vet um the material that's being submitted to us to fact check it to make sure that\nIt is this is why we talk about not just opinion but opinion\nGrounded in ... informed opinion um anything that we publish um we're fine was opinion but it needs to be grounded in solid information\nAnd can you give me an example I I'm just finishing up pieces of this was finishing piece this morning it's going to run a in a couple of weeks and it is replete with with links\nBecause links bring you to ... so if you're going to cite a statistic well let's find out where this just came from so someone gives us a peace whether it's someone who who writes a piece for us and and simply cites a statistic without giving a source\nOf you know we're probably not going to regard that individual is a credible contributor so we um you know we'll just and that that's the curse the second half of his question is how do you deal with fake news we give them authentic nose and you give them authentic news that as well supported\nOkay um let's talk about some of the the pieces that have already been published in the Rochester bacon and Paul can I start with something that you write a partial Pfizer or parts of the five is of course been a very hot issue in the community and you made the case that um it's impossible to stage to know what's going to happen with that piece of land and that you wouldn't but a penny of\nThe twenty five million dollars pledged by Tom Kalil subtle for an art center as to what it is going to be now for obvious reasons the arts center is still quite an open question and council may have some decisions to make pretty soon about whether we are going back to square one but you don't think it's going to be open space even do\nIn um in a direction that would make him unable in his pheromone able to participate and they look kind of like a Hail Mary pass doesn't mean it won't happen or it's impossible but that was a fascinating development pretty hard to to pin down the sourcing but we were able to do it um and it sounds like that's the kind of stuff that\nCould happen with the ... I mean you you all know a lot of people in this town you have a lot of sources I mean spirited there's no I mean you've got ... story coming I don't know what you're breaking on our ... um we'll talk about the I'd love to talk to you about ... how you view\nReporting on the Rochester winner anti poverty initiative what's the goal of a piece on that well\nI think um people want answers on our ... I think people\nHave are curious as to how we're grading it what metrics they used to sort of a ... to measure their success in my piece uh that uh comes out this week takes a look at\nUm not just that it just how our ... views itself\nI think um what I found was a disconnect between how our ... views itself and how the community views are happy so that's a what the story to look at\nHow ... how would you describe that and again it's never fun to ask to dumb down a piece that when the whole purpose of the Rochester begins to respect the reader and respect death but how would you sort of just still that disconnect between the way to community of used a Russia's really anti poverty initiative into the initial maybe itself\nI think that the community looks at it as a grant making organization that they received a lot of money that they have been slow to do allow 'em and they're sitting on all the funds that have come from the state and haven't done anything with it\nI'm I'm happy with say that they're not a grant making organization they're an initiative and an initiative that's owned by the community and that's what and what does that really mean a is what my story takes a look at like what does it mean you're asking me to give everything away\nI Know I Know so what what is the story publishing Thursday on Thursday are you going to tell us who's right which perception is more rights and we even see OK Thursday um and the pieces on the Russia's really anti poverty initiative you've got a piece Alice you've got to be some Democrats coming up [noise]\nThey must get today oh I Know that was hosted\nToday actually the uh the the background data behind that that came from the center for governmental research and\nUh I got the it it it it's interesting because this information has been out there uh and I kept an eye both sit on a ... and kind of help out a a ... all the life sciences initiative that that was kind of looking at some of these statistics\nAnd what was really fascinating is but I kind of when I saw that that we were submitting something to the state that said that we in Rochester\nHave more a stem grabs a per capita than any other place of a million or more people are in the country it was really kind of hit me with this this is as a pretty big shock\nAnd so I went and I looked at the center for governmental research trying to understand kind of you know this is really say what I what I'm hoping it says\nUh and and and ... and and not only that but uh for arts degrees aware also number two in the country and if you look at the combination I must be number one in stem or in number one and arts I mean we have a truly a amazing what kind of punishment or that that happens of\nUh each year as as these new stem and arts degrees or get a a individuals ah graduate so from my perspective or maybe this also goes back to to something a little bit earlier in the conversation\nSometimes it's better to have fewer facts but really emphasize it so everybody knows them\nOr because this is a sort of thing that all of us should take such pride in uh in in in Rochester and and from my perspective even though\nA parent leave you know the the stats been around for a while a I think all of us should be saying it because it means so much a two two individuals who are thinking about Rochester whether to to to go to school here to hopefully stay secure or after their schooling has done\nA but but yes I mean I'm I'm personally very proud of of us as a city\nAll right and the last twenty seconds of the music starts Paul since this was this whole thing is your fault the Rochester making if this is a successful first year you'll be able to look back and say what about the beacon [noise] oh\nWell that I'm certainly that we've grown our audience um but really more that we've made an impact on the community that hopefully in several cases we move the conversation and helped create some solution sons from some of the big challenges that we're\nFacing Rochester ... dot com congratulations on week one and thanks for taking the time to be here listeners it's going to be publishing\nUm again with the staff of at least seven and with a number of opinion contributors\nAnd a wide range of issues publishing each week so Rochester beacon dot com digital lonely and I uh I look forward to next conversation I think a lot of journalists in this town of accuracy where you go so thank you for being here and please give us abreast of what's happening there thank you very much if you were in the Rochester

fled in search of greater safety and paying work\nTrump says he's determined to block a migrant caravan from crossing into the U.S illegally the president has repeatedly warned of unauthorized immigrants who resort to gang and other violence in the United states\nThose making the trek north include young and old families and individuals able bodied in wheelchair bound Mexico's president elect suggested yesterday that his country the U.S and Canada work together to fund development in poor areas of southern Mexico and Central America\nWhere caravans are forming NPR's Mara Liasson reports on the political implications of the caravan as President Trump\nStumps in Texas today for incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms\nHe's not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that they are terrorists That's NPR's Mara Liasson Ashley Lopez from member station K. U. T. Austin is covering Trump's visit to Texas or early voting is underway\nElection officials say they're expecting a higher turnout than usual and the coming days Texas has been flooded with a lot of

what am I getting hit by a bus Monday afternoon and I didn't vote of no way\nTo sense for how they view you know Wilma writes look at those properties and what may be millennial generation I don't want to make this adjustable and they'll think it's not but what shoppers now expect want or what would bring them or keep them going tomorrow so I think that'll be instructive I have a flood of comments already which I probably just read all day [noise]\nUm and listeners you can call the program and wait as well if you want to talk about what would keep you going to malls or not but there is an impact on jobs I mean I I Do think we have to say that with Dennis is is bringing up here is\nIf we all decided to only shop on line\nThere isn't enough of a job sort of replacement for let's just take Amazon for example if everybody bought everything they bought at malls out Amazon there would not be a an equal number of jobs created by Amazon to replace the retail this is from\nTime magazine since two thousand two department stores have lost four hundred and forty eight thousand jobs that's an overall industry decline of twenty five percent\nThe growth of online retailers meanwhile has not offset those losses the e commerce sector is added one hundred Seventy eight thousand jobs\nOver the past Fifteen Years so a net loss doing the math of something like two hundred and Seventy thousand jobs\nWith this change in shopping habits that's just something that we have to\nConsider okay so Greece Henrietta marketplace of all ah east view mall very different properties I mean probably different goals how do you view them and do they need to adapt differently to kind of avoid the around ... do you guys worry about that you know you look at medley centered and think that

property were fortunately able to sell the property before it's alternate demise but it is a very good example of what you don't want to do\nYou do not want to Twitter account for a lonely marketplace no we're never going to say that okay so so how do you view each of those properties and things that we've gotta\nGet get ahead of the so uh before I go property property just a dove tail on your um prior comment\nA grease Rudd center alone employees over twenty three hundred people it generates almost sixteen million dollars of sales tax and pays over five million dollars in property taxes\nAnd the case of east few over ... thirty eight hundred people are employed there uh it generates over thirty million dollars of sales tax\nOn pace property tax between four and five million dollars so the the ah economic relevance from a lot of different levels of that of those entities I think is very important\nUm about Fifteen Twenty years ago um we made the decision to ... because each market as you pointed out is very different\nAnd it wasn't smart ... you have to merchandise you have to give the consumer what it is they want when they come to the mall and in the case of a take one at a time I mean ... is a terrific community is a very dense community or I Would say in terms of\nTaking ownership of property the grease resident really uh we get a seven days a week the traffic there's terrific the food court has become\nA Center for people to meet both young and old if you go there at eight o'clock in the morning there's um a very vibrant group of um of people mostly retirees who will walk them all which by the way I think end end is over a mile and a half\nAnd then have a cup of coffee and sit there and you know chat with their friends for hours and it's it's really incredible to see 'em in the case of Henrietta which\nI think it's no secret has had its problems and I think is a victim of the consolidation I mentioned earlier um [noise]\nWe uh are actually that's the one of the four properties that we envision are the most dramatic evolution in terms of a non retail outcome\nUm while I Can't necessarily go into more detail about that plans are in the works that could dramatically change\nOr that project in to a um a ... a facility offering a wide range of uses whether that's retail office or medical um I I Would just say in probably the next six to eight months there should be greater clarity on that\nPittsburgh plaza which interestingly enough was built back in Nineteen sixty one\nI'm is its success in part is it's location or being on ... avenue next to a a very successful Wegmans store that I think most people have been too at some point\nUm that project has gone through significant evolution though the coming and going of chase picking a we had a handful of different supermarkets beef foreman theaters I mean there's been a lot of change there but you know the project is in a very desirable location\nAnd um continue to do well and then in ... the case of east you a super regional draw built in Nineteen seven Nineteen sixty\nNine and then it just gives me Seventy one and then expanded in Seventy three and Ninety five and two thousand and three\nUm we have deployed significant capital especially over probably the past twenty or twenty five years creating the lifestyle entrance bringing environment our um now we have Sears to deal with um\nAh we continue to see great opportunity and growth there but back to emily's comment earlier or we need the retailers to join us in this journey to create a better shopping experience\nUm we recently opened up a new apple store there which if you compare that to what was there before you know you talk about an experience it's an exponential improvement and our hope is as we improve the retailers will improve with us\n[noise] so are you saying that if market place for example let's take the Henrietta property if you'd made no essential foundational changes to that mall it it would be it would stand the most chance of being in danger in in a short amount of time\nYes yes I think a ... as as star count contracts flashback Twenty years ago and rounded quite mall was a vibrant fourth regional mob a lot of retailers national had up to three maybe four locations in the market some of them now only have one two at the most so\nAs to be a fall out and unfortunately marketplace being geographically in the middle between the other two malls is is really a bear the brunt of those are those closures and we don't anticipate those stores coming back I mean I think\nThe key is finding new stores and managing what you have right now for retaining excuse me\nTalking to Dennis ... senior vice president for listening and development at Wilmer right Emily has new Lynch's here who is director of contempt for I hard rock and freelance social media strategist and Lindsey Hicks who used to be a marketing director for a mall in Michigan now assistant director of marketing\nHere at our team let me turn to Emily and Lindsey for their thoughts on what they're hearing and as I Do that let me just getting a little bit of a different perspective not different perspective but just different ideas and we're most maybe going retail dive dot com had an article titled not dead just changing with the future holds for the American mall\nAnd they positive three ideas and their number one malls as lifestyle centers the question of what happens\nNext including perhaps\nA wider range of options for visitors than just shopping and eating so full lifestyle centers number two malls as living spaces taking the idea of lifestyle centers one step further adding residential living space and for me I'm from the Cleveland area I grew up in a town called west like which has cracker park now and that's essentially\nWhat they're what number two on this list is I Know people who live there they live in you know pretty ... pretty good uh housing options but expensive at times\nUm but it's kind of living space as well as and number three miles is distribution of fulfillment facilities so you remove the entertainment aspect of them all completely turn it into practical operations aimed at helping service the population that increasingly buys its goods\nOn line or those were three of the ideas I'm Wondering what you guys think with the I'll start with you\nYeah so um everything he said Dennis I completely agree with um throughout the years we've added a lot of the uh same negative stigma malls um and it really is just that they're changing you know there is a boom at one point there are a ton of malls bell and now we have another option we have online sales\nUm and the number of miles is decreasing because a lot of people are going on line\nHowever the quality of those laws that are still here are increasing greatly and it is I'm really are lined up to the store is the developer can really only do so much\nUm it's a the responsibility not the responsibility of the stories on but a great responsibility leans on the stories to provide that better customer experience um yeah I agree ...\nDid you agree with that that is that a lot of a ton of stores\nYeah I think they're I mean it's on us too I mean this is where it's more or less a partnership and um when we when I think what the general public doesn't necessarily um understand is in a lot of cases when we are bringing in\nNew stores are there is in essence a partnership between us and the stores namely a\nWe invest or partner with a store in terms of ah their build out in their costs as an inducement to have them come here so um yes I Would agree with that [noise]\nAll right ah and penny ... depending on Twitter rights and says to me this is like asking how can Sears reworked their catalog to adapt to shoppers habits and preferences shopping has been distilled to getting the cheapest the fastest and most can't compete with that they weren't built\nDaycare within the malls ... to the employees are me that seems like a no brainer just to get to the table and lastly ... anybody they're meant to cherry creek\nMall in Denver\nYeah I I was there and I was blown back because\nIt's a little bit interesting because you have to pay to park but if you buy something they think it's hard like you walk in there and it it first points that look because two stories that reminded me all around the mall until I saw that in the store\nA then I saw the Louis the tone I'm going well you talk about a high end mall is is that ... that's it\nSo thank you keep it you've been to that one yeah the largest yeah it's a very nice small okay Tesla how about Tesla to replace so here you have been in discussions with Tesla now Tesla\nIs waiting on some state approvals for a deal I don't even know if they ... dealerships but um there are some legal hurdles that they still need to work through in order to open\nStores in upstate New York they are looking in Rochester for in essence a service center\nAnd um I think\nKeats assumptions on wearing the market there looking are fair and I'll just leave it at that is it\nIs it not impossible but Tesla would located east female it's not out of the realm of possibility yes if that were to happen we would know by when uh I don't think for another year based on the ledge is you know where the legislation is because they can't do anything 'til 'til the state of ...\nThe whole community listens to the show you could break some real news today and you're kind of holding back but I don't want I I Can't I Can't say something that isn't necessarily true so okay that's fair enough I I and I do want to ask\nBefore we get our only break in and then we're gonna we're we're going to dive into something that many emails people have said I Want to ask Emily and Lindsey what they think about um this idea of what millennials killed I had some some comments for people were saying I'm offended that this notion of millennials killed phone landlines millennials killed\nThe shopping mall millennials killed you know what a voicemail whatever it is voice mails terrible children killed but um every generation is changing\nAnd so I don't know why it's become a mean but some millennials have written to me that they say it's offensive even if we do kill the shopping mall were just you know habits change generation to generation you offended by that Lindsey now every generation has killed something\nThat's not [laughter] I think it's become such a tongue in cheek phrase now and it's really super serious when they said and I think it's just I get a laugh out of it I'm happy to kill whatever industry needs to go [laughter] you want to participate and oh yeah the murder of ... in the fishing industry\nChange of give a a four four to nine five talk toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five to six three W ... calling from Rochester to six three nine nine nine for do you go to the mall you want malls to survive and thrive Dennis Wal Mart you you employ in the Rochester area you're for property is how many people total\nOh I don't have the entire total ah I just listed Greece and in uh\nEast to thirty eight hundred and twenty somebody three hundred if yes that's sixty one hundred fifty one hundred mile it too\nSo we're talking you know probably well over ten thousand when you look at all of their properties combined to a lot of people and the question is our habits of shopping the impact of the way we shop and the way we spend our dollars and what you want to see in terms of experience so after we get our only break at the hour we'll come back to your comments and I do want to ask all of our gas\nIf the question of urbanism can sort of translate to malls now the New York times wrote that are in Nineteen Ninety two they could count forty eight malls within a Ninety minute drive in times square and malls had become the main streets of America as William ... wrote in Nineteen eighty five in the book the mall of America is that a good thing\nOr if ... if main streets are suffering but malls are where people are going to have a cup of coffee to walk to do all those things we can do on main street is that a good thing and can we learn lessons from urbanism and apply any of that we'll talk about that as well and get more your phone calls and

three times the size of the old apple store at ease fabulous yes okay but your other ... most don't have an update apple is and I think he thought it was very perceptive apple is is the most coveted name for\nOur industry and the traffic that it dries I mean you go to apple unfortunately thing more times in our for necessity I was there this weekend 'cause my son ... screen on his phone and but they create inexperienced that is unlike anything and you walk in you check in the customer service for nine is\nI think paramount in our industry and yeah apple without apple your you know it's tough\nOkay well my husband and I walked by that new star last weekend and it was the only star family liked by and went whoa\nYeah [laughter] yeah it it was beautiful it is yeah I I Will say I want to put it in a vote for every mall should have the kids play area and not just sixty seven percent of your most but all of them yes okay that's a duly noted since you're here yes I thought I Would put that in the eye and speaking of apple and more here's Robin Henry at on the phone go ahead Rob\nHello or is this am I on your your on right now we can hear you okay correct right thank you Ah yes ah my name is Robyn I'm of adjunct professor of business that or I see and I would just say that uh if we think it historically\nThe ball as being kind of like the modern day or Gore us from Greece says the gathering place it people that\nI I'm not so sure that it was Jeff Bezos Amazon's that kind of kills all of that I Believe it was your job Supreme cook an apple that have created this is a social social media network or social media\nA air where students or people millennials don't socialize personally anymore so I'm sort of thinking that\nBecause kids don't don't get together a person that I I Believe that is part of a the demise of the\nLaw I don't see this as one or the ... everything that I have researched and tried to understand about sort of changing culture one of the reasons that coffee shops are thriving is because millennials in Jersey they love to get together in person and actually sit down face to face they spent so much time screen fit\nScreen time that they they actually like that at least I mean I'll be I'll be corrected in a moment I'm sure a studio but that's my observation you don't think so Rob\nRight well I Do but I think it's a different kind of retail is that's a different kind of socializing okay that's retail okay and I see it in my students all the time where\nI Walk into a classroom full of students and there you could hear a pin drop because everybody is on their screen and I just think that they socialize electronically and their their retailing or actual gathering of people in space\nIs not that important these days\nOkay ... thanks Rob I appreciate the phone call a meeting in person um I kinda do agree with that that I'm doing social media and everything that I Do right now I'm Emily does it is on um I Am I going with this one you take over\n[laughter] and lots of times they do forget that I haven't seen someone and several months because I've been talking to them on Twitter everyday and it's easy enough to think that we're still connected but I find myself that ugly duck coffee like two or three times a week meeting people face to face or I'll go to a yoga class at a winery or something so there are ways that I'm spending my money that our social\nI think it's also the expansion of options that we have um I remember going to the mall or the movie theater when I was younger you gotta ride there and that was the only place that you could go on our generation right now we can go everywhere anywhere we have over we have public transportation we have obviously they've always had cars\nUm but I think we have more options to do those things and we know what's trending right now if you know and social media that your friends are going to the coffee shop you're going to be more apt to go there were no one you know it's going to ... you might not out\nOkay Dennis how do you feel about this idea that a younger shoppers ... you know Rob seized they're changing habits yeah I'm always I\nFor kids to college to
