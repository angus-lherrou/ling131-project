{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WRUR", "content": "... ... no\nWith the ... the cell phone\nGoing to make a dent snake one\nGathered a qualified and diverse group of researchers from around the world to identify research and model the one hundred most substantive existing solutions to address climate change was uncovered is a path forward that can roll back\nThe global greenhouse glass gas emissions within Thirty years\nThe research ... revealed that humanity does have the means and the techniques at hand now and nothing new needs to be invented to do this so the key here is that this isn't grandiose\nThis isn't if you invent some sort of Rube Goldberg machine we can figure this all out it's everything within reach now if we decide to do it and you can reverse it I'd like to listen to some of what Paul Huck and had to say because when he talks about climate proposals if you Google as he says top climate or not proposals to deal with climate change\n... he was not very impressed for a long time a lot of it was how to slow down warming how to slow it down you know how to gradually reduced here's his response to this notion of well if we just slow down warming was\nIf you're going the wrong way you have to stop you just can't slow down and and now we're not going the wrong way you still are going the wrong way\nAnd that's why I say right now the proposals around addressing global warming are like Thelma and Louise in slow motion or ... or the cliff we want to go slower and that is not an inspirational goal for humankind only call that makes sense\nFor him as the reverse global warming stopped turned around and go the other way and I don't believe that you can achieve something you've hit on name but it is you want to achieve and naming the goal of reversal\nActually opens up possibility there's this idea that somehow we make our goal is to big you know this too hard and the other way around the bigger your maker go no more ... and your mind and creativity and imagination sores within a big goal and doesn't get very far when the goal is really tiny and and and miniscule\nSuch poll hockey in his book is draw down it's a New York times best seller and you really ought to check it out the website I think it's drop down down or if I'm remembering correctly and sue what's going on tonight\nTonight one of the things that are organization to patch on the alliance is doing is taking this book and trying to make it accessible to ordinary people in local communities\nSo what we are having tonight is an introduction to it the title actually is reverse in global warming introduction to draw down and as an opportunity for people to come together to hear more from called hawk and that was a clip of what you'll be we'd be hearing tonight\nBut ... connecting with others exploring what the solutions are noticing which of the solutions you have any interest in or connection with and particularly what we can be doing at the local level one of the things\nThe reasons I'm so passionate is I Can't wait we can't wait for Washington we need to be focusing on what we can do here in Rochester community so tonight is a place for people to come learn and then from that we will be offering\nA fourth session course called drawdown solutions getting into action that's also going to be at natural gas just starting on the twenty ninth self people come tonight five they really want to work with others to get into concrete action locally around solutions they can come to this for session course\nI Want to listeners to think in your mind and I'm going to reveal the answer in a minute what do you think is number one on the solution list what do you think is number two um I find it fascinating so if you go to draw down down or they have their list\nIn a nice easy chart the top one hundred solution and it's based in its ranked on the possible benefit to the environment essentially and the possible magnitude of the change here [noise]\nSo what do you think number one would be I Will tell you in a moment I Do want to offer a couple of things here in regards to what I think also has to change it and we'll get our guests thoughts on this you're going to have family members and you're going to have friends and say it it's too big a problem\nUm or passively they're going to say look we'll innovate our way out of it eventually we always do\nOr if it's really a problem or they might say it's not even real we're still dealing with some of that the only listen to a couple of clips one from just this morning\nOn Fox News [noise] so um this clip comes from Fox and friends Brian kill made is talking about the lovely ... interview on sixty minutes with President Trump that aired last night and kill me was complaining about the fact that Leslie stall really seems to think climate change is real\nVery first question is if she believes in global warming and that's fine [noise] um and climate and man's role in climate change and that's okay\nBut I don't think you should bring your your point of view she was trying to win over the president with her point of view about it I assume that all scientists was at a science is that right as other scientists say something's going on out there though is the role of man has not been unveiled to a way in which the president except same way mark Rubio\nAnd it's a very similarly in similar questions\nI so number one on my list of proposed solutions it's just stop watching cable news forever and I and I mean all cable news all of it I mean this mankind invents a lot of great things\nAnd then sometimes mankind had been something and it's a mistake and that's ... cable news just stop it and convince evangelist of your family it's hurting you don't watch cable news anymore you don't need it\nIt's bad for your brain so that's my idea we'll see what our guest thinking just a moment the other clip I Want to ... you to listen to is um uh so the Republicans running for governor in Pennsylvania a Scott Wagner is what was that a town hall event in which a young woman in the audience I say young women and she's Eighteen\nGrabbed my phone and asked about a lot of money that Wagner has taken from the fossil fuel industry let's listen to her question and let's listen to how he responds to her\n[laughter] [laughter] really\nBut we can't wait for those two things to happen to address climate change so I Would hate for people listening today to think where we can't do anything because we're not going to get federal action anytime soon um there's a whole lot more that we can do and then we have\nTo do and I think this can be viewed as sort of a part of income it it's not I think it's in some ways it's um it's even more nuanced difficult for Democrats because when you look at the Paris climate agreement\nTo some degree the political left celebrated that work and then most scientists will tell you that was not good enough and we want to just run up and so and so all the backpack and you're doing is not actually helping solve the problem exactly um so it is tough but but it has to be called up I'm Elle how do you feel\nAbout what you're well I've I've come to project drawdown from my participation with citizens climate lobby and we're taking a very non partisan approach absolutely we are working with Republicans and Democrats so I Would kind of add to the nuance of what you said\nUm we now have a Ninety members of Congress forty five Republicans and forty five Democrats who are in the house climate solutions cocker ... this is our hope we believe that federal legislation will come out of this caucus to put a price on carbon so we're doing everything we can to leverage political will\nTo get our our members of Congress to put forth legislation to put a price on carbon and this will actually energize and super charge everything that's being proposed in project drawdown so it's a\nGood one two punch alright so listeners if you've got thoughts you want to share you can email the program connections of W ... dot org\nI've already got some emails from you I've got some predictions on what number one on the drawdown list is going to be we'll get to that and just second\nNow they have greater capacity to cope with shocks from natural disasters in extreme weather events so that is from their their list number six they're\nEducating girls and family planning and um what what I Want to do is get our only break the hour we're going to come back and we're gonna we'll go through more the list got a lot more to tell you about what's happening with drawdown events so we're told you about the one tonight there's more coming up the to start but we can tell you about\nAnd I will take your calls and emails as we discuss these solutions not just the gloom but the optimistic opportunity that we have to stop\nAnd reverse warming was picked up break right now it can actually\nComing up in our second hour we talked to photo journalist ... the Democrat and chronicle who was closer than he has ever been to a gunfight\nLast week an active shooting situations in which he captured remarkable pictures and video we're going to talk about that moment what it was like for him and his career while he puts himself at risk and why police officers run toward the danger in moments like that\nFollowing their friends we'll talk with us\nSupport for you\nOkay they're already there or sue sue or start polling what do you think [noise]\n[noise] I think that the whole there is a movement as we've talked about this being a critical time in our culture where we are moving away from domination we're moving away from patriarchy toward cooperation and collaboration\nLooking at the earth as a as something living and sacred rather than something to be exploited so I think we're in a time of change and I I think to the point you know this isn't going to change overnight\nIn terms of chain getting rid of capitalism but I Love movements like conscious capitalism that are helping people see it within the capitalistic system that there is the triple bottom line you know people planet and profit and so on so I think rather than thinking of getting rid of it which is I think\nNot the goal that I that I Would work toward a I think that it is possible it's possible for us to keep taping taking steps and raising consciousness about the triple bottom line thing\nBecause I think that capitalism can work if is has that consciousness\n... Joel Rose to us from Hector and says\nYour guest referred to item number for implying that report refers to giving up meat entirely but it's not exactly what it says but most commonly the way American measure it more plant foods in the diet means that the smaller demand for animal foods can be provided through pastured local meat and dairy so shop at your local farmers market\nYeah I'm really glad she may have point 'cause I meant to mentioned that earlier as well yeah reduce right above average Americans eating three quarters of a pound of ... of meat a day you know Britain drop down draw that down behind you know well for an invite really nice quality made mhm\nOkay and that sort of and it does say on the Web site um draw downs website with number for eating a plant rich died it doesn't say plant only to split ...\n... but it does say that this is interesting if cows were their own nation they would be the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases ... just because it was so ... we need to eat fewer of those guys right than girls yeah [laughter] definitely fewer um [noise]\nUh and in ... is endorsed uh on the drawdown website is a good way to to make change but it doesn't say eliminating meat entirely so Joe from ... thank you very much\nLike that um we could change codes we could ban new fossil new construction from having fossil fuels in order to keep them there are lots of steps we could take without getting federal legislation to do it\nAnd I also think related to that is coming together you know so often we think what can I Do individually but it's only you all the power of the collective yeah that's why citizens climate lobbyist so powerful because\nThere is this collective so I think the more we can come together to come up with solutions and projects that we can collaborate on and put pressure\nAt every level even invest in our businesses or in other institutions I Know there was one ... one a group of people who were concerned about the the food waste in their schools\nSo they ... they as a group approached the school to say what can how can we managed that so I think there's a power as we come together in action\nComing from the show I think one of the things that most attracted me to project drawdown was this idea of the four levels the individual working at the individual hearing callers talk about what they're doing individually\nOr then there's the the larger group the family group what we were well because we just were family members then there's the community level of involvement and finally the policy level the federal government level we need to operate at all and I picked project drawdown enhances that and it's just a remarkable part of\nThe program [noise] All right Dave writes to us and says regarding meat it's just the latest research indicates that the u._k. and the U.S citizens would need to cut beef\nBy Ninety percent milk by sixty percent while increasing things like beans between four and six times so I'm David just pointing out that if um if the admonition is not to necessarily get rid of meat entirely but to move to a plant rich diet mostly plants\nEat food not too much mostly plants are that are that it's a dramatic reduction in beef I'm ... and that\nWe all could have a point there are real quick let me get one more suing it's today on connections to sue in fair port is the third sue of the hour ago ...\nHi I'm I have an old freezer that I'm not using a and actually it is still good working order but it is very old and I think probably a uses its effect us or [laughter]\nAnd I'm Wondering if they're in places where I can I can ... take it ... it recycle it basically\nIt's a very good question I don't know I probably suggest ah looking at the equal park in a county yeah my ... and call them to find out what can be done or with that if that's possible\nIt's a great point the ALS racing I I think it's Monroe County government that runs the ego park and either sue they can take it or if they can't take it they might be able to tell you who can\nOkay I Know Archie and he was taking them reclaiming them um and they would give you a thirty dollars fifty dollars but that program has gone I'm so I'm I'm looking for alternatives thanks\nThank you so good luck with that or ... or less Ninety seconds\nI'm and want to thank our guests for sharing their insight this hour and we're going to try to leave it on a note here I got to say after reading Paula Hawkins and seeing interviews you start dark\nBut you start to feel excited sushi Smith when I talked to my six year old and his friends you actually just let them know what's going on they have a brightness to them and they say all will solve it now we want to wait till they are adults to solve it but I feel optimist when I talk to younger people but I don't I don't know how you feel\n[noise] well it depends on the day I Know you said your name and optimism trying to change yeah yeah you're working on you know what what makes me feel\nPassionately as is taking action every day and whether that's personal action or collective action I'm I'm I'm doing it all\nUm that's the only way we're going to win is to not give up\nAnd enjoy the true joy is a journey and the people that I get to interact with every single day on this journey there are incredible and it really restores your feeling about humanity really there's Rochester is just a fabulous fabulous place so\nGrateful we moved here a and other law since we moved here I've been very engaged on climate and that that is a bittersweet but\nTwenty seconds ... you know any more you are you inspired the money I don't but I teach a constantly and presentations of yeah but I Do and I just I've got to say that it it what what has to come from the heart not just ahead the engagement with climate solutions must come must be felt deeply in the heart and it's if the engagement involved with people\nAnd to start polio has been telling us about what's going on tonight so it's tonight seven pm starts right Metra metro justice this is a a New York drawdown events that we've been talking about the solutions you want to learn more get involved it's AT Metro justice and eleven Fifteen east main street see you there tonight thanks for being here\nAnd I just want to end with Paula Hawkins words it's game on not\nGame over game on and not game over it better be our thanks to sue ...

as a fake Pocahontas or markets deeply insulting to Native American groups several months ago in Montana he even better generous donation is senator warns favorite charity if she could prove them wrong\nI Want you to ours for your favorite charity\nThan stumbled into the playground which then you know cause concern for the school administrator mills administration there and principles and they I think immediately went into a lockdown situation [noise]\nUm as this is all kind of unfolding very calmly very routinely it seems you know\nUh [noise] almost you know textbook um I I start to notice officers down the street are\nPulling out long guns I'm a little heavier artillery than what you normally see\nIn a minute ... director or any of the terminology yeah [laughter]\nUm and they are you know they they seem to be in a in a state of heightened alert and and that's when I kinda made my way down to\nThe intersection of north good man and and enforcer street because\nThat's ten you know where the action kind of what's happening in ... typically drawn to you know the action and we're looking to show what's what's happening you know what what the responses are and and what's taking place you know as you know crime scenes or or or incidents like this you know unfold\nAnd he can you hear a little shorter and my voice [laughter] tell little trying to trying to ... ... react us here brings back a little bit of the time so I'm just trying to take the slope slowly so I can do it accurately\nUm and I and and so this unfolds and we'll Morgan we just mentioned comes down and stands next to me and he says man I think I think this guy's head in our way and\nUm I took up a position by a tree I'm along the sidewalk so that I could you know maybe have something to kind of like\nBe behind if there was a vehicle chase coming or something like that and sure enough all of a sudden I turn left or I look south and north Goodman down to the bay and there goes the van and there goes about another twenty top cop cars behind it\nAnd then I you know about two minutes later I look north and the van goes by on Hudson and were literally surrounded we're in a sea of of police vehicles the SWAT vehicle was in that chase\n'em and I thought that was the last we'd we'd see a of you know Mr Blake in the van well\nI I look down the street and here comes the van had us I just I turn the camera on and started rolling\nAnd I'm a he\nMade the turn it on on the north forest and if you watch the video you'll hear the gunshots and you'll see him try to basically I think fire on the officers that he was going by as he was making his right hand turns through a barricade I Believe there was\nOur pd and sheriff's officers manning that barricade um and then he continues down north forest um and makes a left onto the street where he eventually was um shot and killed\nThe video that we see from you the the window the driver's window that shot out\nSo [noise] so so yeah you do see 'em a lot of gunfire you see actually smoke um barrel smoke from you know law enforcement officers discharging their firearms ... at a very close range [noise]\nUh whether that window I'm I'm not a expert and law enforcement whether that window is being blown out are blowing in I think is up for debate [noise] okay um I I Know that gun was pointed at uh the the gun that Mr Blake had in in the van was pointed at will\nUh will Morgan from channel Thirteen if you look at HIS Video you can see him clearly pointing that got at him [noise]\nAh I later went and reviewed my video from that are from further down the road\nAnd what I mean further down the road as the event is the van approaches I'm looking at through the windshield I'm as the as Mr Blake's fan as approaching towards me\nAnd uh I've slowed down the video and you can clearly see him pointing a handgun out the window or I shouldn't say out the window but towards the window because the windows rolled up ... ... yeah [noise]\nSo um again getting back to the glass in or out um I think\nFrom ballistic standpoint if you shoot at something you know you would see tenable it would go through something and blow in if something's blowing out that means a projectiles possibly coming out as well or\nMaybe that gun was so close to the concussion you know from that that wasn't being fired blew the window\nOut but there's a number of shots in your how close do you think you were forty feet at the time thirty feet are probably ... probably closer to twenty twenty twenty Fifteen closest you've been to active gunfire\nI well I shot skating trap all through college you know that film and I'm Sorry I'm a I'm an avid hunter um I I I've been around gunfire\nUm this this is a a different type of gunfire this is obviously\nI'm a a heavy barrage of you know a of of noise that\nUm you know frankly uh has kept me up at night a couple of times um since this all happened so um it was it was shocking it was um it was it was something that\nI heard it go off I I said don't in the back of my head I was like don't flinch just don't flinch you've got to just keep rolling just keep rolling [noise]\nUm and and don't let that affect you know don't let this affect you right now can I just ask you briefly then can I let's get our colleagues had sovereign just as your friend yeah I'd have been okay with you getting behind the tree and not thinking don't which\nUm I think it happened also\nAsk that if I was a I was I was in journalism mode I really was I wasn't in a fight or flight mode um I'd equated to um you know\nYou know being a surgeon I mean when a surgeon is you know performing surgery they are not concerned with the blood squirting a a you know all over there trying to save somebody's life I wasn't\nConcerned with um\nJumping behind a tree I was concerned with getting the picture\nOr hitting the video I'm going to ask you a ... question then did anything quickly go through your mind like if I'm getting shot him getting shot but I'm not stopping to get an even thing didn't even know if it happened very fast at ... and ... and I can tell you the the the officers who were behind that barricade there I they knew we were there\nThey they knew we were there they they understood that there was citizens in the area\nI you know my hats are often those guys for for for the discipline that they engaged and\nI I you know\nI've been doing this a long time I mean you know tied and I were joking outside that there was a time when I I did a ride along with him and he put me in a van with um some guys who are targeting open air drug markets and\nThere was a bullet proof vest ... blanket hanging in the van I said why is this blanketing here they pulled the blanket back and they showed the gun holes that were through the bullet holes that were through the van because they'd been targeted by these drug dealers [noise]\nSo I understand and I appreciate um [noise]\nThese guys do what long our law enforcement community does I think they're training as top notch and you know the wild card and all this was Mr Blake really\nUm ... my concern with the officers I I I didn't I didn't feel like I was in jeopardy I'm from them obviously Mr Blake was\nWas something to be concerned of and that's again why I kinda posted up by this large tree so that I could protect myself if that van came down that street you know at least had something that would stop that van if it came up on the sidewalk I Would at least have something to hide behind\n[noise] um [noise]\nI'm Sorry I lost track of the best thing about I guess you know getting back to the whole processing thing about you know um yeah again it was just I was in journalism mode and and I I wasn't thinking in that way I mean I think about it now um\nYou know the adrenalin rush that um you go through when you have something like that happened uh I'm starting to feel the effects of that now I'm I'm my body is like I like going back to work was going to be\nSomething that would be good for me and that I Would be able to kind of had might take my mind off that um and that was probably the wrong choice or I'm going to take a couple of days off after I get done here with you and just try and regroup and um\nAnd let the physical aspects of it um catch up you know try and catch up physically with and you know some ... some sleep and you know take it you know take my mind out of\nYou know ... the day to day stuff at work that day to day social media the day to day um you know rigors of of my job [noise]\nI Want to make clear that this tragic story is really about a family targeted by an individual and um there's no intention to lose sight of that this hour the discussion is about the work\nThat is done by journalists video in photo journalists reporters and by law enforcement um but I Want to just acknowledge that this is about a family that had a tragic in just a devastating day and in we feel for for everyone in the family and connected to them\nThis is where it takes you know I don't think usually this extreme but um we're having that conversation about what happened last Wednesday in those chaotic moments you heard ... elite photographer at the Democrat and chronicle George's silver all from the Democratic chronicle in ... county sheriff tied ... break in the hour and right back with them next\n[noise]\nI'm Evan Johnson Tuesday I'm an ex connections\nThe Rochester chapter of the world affairs council is looking at the Trump administration's policy them strategies around the world on Tuesday they were looking at Asia and our guest\nWho's a guest and the world affairs council is not only the director of the south Asia center but it's managed programs in arms control disarmament in more we'll discuss it Tuesday and connection [noise]\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from cat and mouse that located on Gregory street in the south ledge featuring

met them Dusten during our brief break a lead photographer from the Democrat and chronicle ... he was\nJust stressing a point that I think probably bears mentioning again on air which is that whenever the public was making of of where you were in how you got there I'm this wasn't the case that usually happens we've all been there where\nUh there's something happening and there's a perimeter established and uh one of my old colleagues at Thirteen ... retired pulled the past we used to be really good at getting around perimeter say so I don't know that chair ...\nTo find them in backyards from February ... J chief or to pass goal was cheap or a videographer channel Thirteen and my goodness was he good at finding a way\nTo the scene and sometimes put himself in danger but I Love your ... but uh usually that's the case in this case it came to you\nYeah I mean you know I I think that just to touch quelled a misconception that you know the the media was there to cover a a a shooting you know we weren't out they're actively pursuing\nOr being involved with this this this chase 'em you know we weren't actively pursuing the kill zone the kill zone came to us I mean so you know we we found ourselves basically\nUm you know alongside law enforcement reacting to uh you know basically somebody who was looking to do a lot of destruction and a lot of harm to you know a anybody who might have been standing around could have been you know potential victim\nUm so you know\nIt's\nIt's it's a little unsettling to you know a ... you know think about being in that situation you know we were we were joking about Paul jumped in you know in the yards to try and find stuff\nYou know look we all push the envelope a little bit um you know we want we want to um you know we want to get the picture we want to get the story we want to show what's going on\nUm but you know no picture and no video is worth getting killed over um although there are journalists who have been killed I mean if you think about Chris Hondros a special on Netflix the guy was an outstanding war photographer and\nYou know he took a sniper a bullet in Yemen um and ah the ... the Netflix a documentary I think it talks a lot about why we do what we do as journalists\nI think you're you're on the mark though that I I think that when I mentioned people like Paul to pass going in all of us in those situations we tried to push the boundaries share factor we don't do it to\nDisrespect one side or something even if a bank you present it because you used used to average perimeters for a reason\nDoes what happened last Wednesday change anything when it comes to how you're going to ... to state the obvious that was a fluid situation that was going from different scene a different scene but does this um impact at all how you're going to handle things going for\nYou think about ... and outer perimeter snows are designed to identify the kill zone to keep people out of the kill zone right in the NFL for law enforcement at ah we don't accidentally wander into a kills on\nA those are all natural things in his design according off a problem and minimize the expansion of the problems first thing to do set a perimeter around it and in the problem you haven't signed up for a merger problem it doesn't get any bigger\nUm because we coordinate off a and the situation the other day you you've seen the suspect drive into our perimeter right intentionally drive around to traffic control points into our perimeter which again is something that we go back and we look at you know we we trained for this in a terrorist type environment in the past where\nYou know we got to secure vital infrastructure inside the county Monroe you know we got a scare number one we got a secure water treatment plants\nAre and we set up a perimeter points ... wants to keep you know people born id IDs improvised explosive devices but you know in in a in a target of violence criminal act\nIs something that it's pretty unusual from that standpoint so we got to go back and look at those things are going to lead auto a block to keep someone from country to them\nYou know um we we definitely ... every every chance we get to learn what suspects were doing we we always think of as I recall the reviews go back what we're what we're right and wrong how do we improve and here's another example of\nYou know he's in Tempe and getting back into a block for some reason we are human intelligence could we do something different I don't know for good or not but you know ... you know ... ... troops out more often or didn't sports for more available and more training\nI dunno if they are available I'm just saying those are things we naturally go through a process of what can we do better do we need more equipment when something different\n[noise] but I'm going to get back to what they can do some of the the tools they have their disposal in those moments but don't ask George is silver all who's a reporter with the Democratic critical a reporter since ... how long have you been at the DNC\nUh I started on September fourth and have fun at the DNC for\nAlmost a month and a half what do you remember about last Wednesday it's it's interesting because I'm I'm\nLearning a lot more about it by having this conversation so um when you get sent out to a shooting it's um it usually has already happened you're going to the scene after the fact that you're going to get some basic information sometimes you get lucky enough to go with the photographer the photos you try to\nTalk to anybody who witnessed it and it's it's usually pretty straightforward you don't actively go into you know something that's happening like this and so when we went out on Wednesday I'm\nI don't think anybody really expected especially not me I was looking back on that the thing that frightens me the most is how unprepared I was and how\nI mean it I I'm nervous just thinking about it because I mean I didn't know it was coming I think I'm very lucky that I was a max because he did\nIt was weird right before you know everything came through our way he had seen every one with their with their guns drawn and standing there and he knew something was up and it was really it was really weird like how intuitive you worked at the situation and so\nUm I mean for me I'm twenty two I've you know I mean I started my career almost two years ago when I graduated from school and\nI mean I've covered shootings and drownings in car accidents and you know done other stuff but never anything like this and I think it's um I mean it's definitely a great experience I'm I'm Glad I had the chance to to be there on into you know cover or something like that and then afterward I actually\nStayed around the scene and got to talk to some family members and witnessed the other side of that you know I mean we're never there for the beginning when everything's unfolding and so to see that and then to watch the family react and see people like\nLiterally fall to the ground screaming and crying and it was just\nI mean I don't you don't really get to do that all that often especially not me being so new to this [noise]\nYeah and I think you know just to touch back on that that's an another part of um [noise]\nYou know some of the process that I Know law enforcement and and and journalists have to go through to as you know we are engaging with people who have just you know had probably the most horrific um\nThing happened in their lives so you know a little bit of that rubs off on us as well um so you know to be caught up in the\nUh the physicality of it and then be touched by the emotional aspect of it um by talking to these these family members and witnesses\nYou know there's there's a lot to process or a ... and those things those are the things that\nYou know stick with you um you'll remember that for a long time oh yeah definitely\nWhere were you when everything was happening\nPretty close to max out a little bit further up Goodman towards the school but I mean we were in the same areas you can hear the gunfire oh yeah and like and the thing that scares me the most is like\nI mean I went home that night and max and I were talking about that on the way over I could not stop replaying the whole day in my head and I was very frustrated with how I'm naive I was and whereas other people like max is prepared and was ready to hide behind something like I did not even see it coming and I think that's you know me being new to it that's\nI mean I had no idea what to expect I had no clue and you can't really prepare for that because it it doesn't really happen and it's not really something I think my editors would have sent me into if they had known it was going to happen\nYou know there's a difference there between what ... talking about with training your men and women because ultimately if you become a W to become an officer you will be in a situation like that and you will have to do it for the first time and you have to be prepared the first time", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "15"}
