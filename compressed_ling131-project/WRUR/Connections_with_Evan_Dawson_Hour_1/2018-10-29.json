at an Atlanta post office in a statement posted on Twitter CNN president Jeff Zucker says there is no danger to the channels headquarters\nMeanwhile President Trump is continuing his attacks on the media just days after a mass shooting and\n... bomb plot NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nAs the country processes the deadliest anti Semitic attack and the largest attempted assassination of political leaders in us history the president is back to business as usual\nToday he tweeted that the media is quote the true enemy of the people and he suggested that the anger that led to the to violent incidents is caused by the hostility of the news media\nThe president has condemned the Pittsburgh attack in the mail bombers assassination attempts but he's also continued to attack some of the recipients of the packages all of whom have been frequent targets of the president's rhetoric\nMara Liasson NPR News Washington\nIBM is working on its largest ever acquisition the tech giant is buying the software company red hat for about thirty four billion dollars NPR's Alina Selyukh reports red hat is most famously the maker of the line at operating system\nRedhead is an interesting company in that it makes it so called open source software that means the source code for its main product is free anyone can get it what makes it profitable or the fees companies pay red had billions of dollars for support of their products the most famous one of them is Linux\nBut the firm also does a lot in cloud storage services all that is attractive to IBM\nWhich has been shifting away from hardware and trying to re fashion itself as a company providing cloud and other services to compete with Microsoft and Amazon\nI'm for this program certainly the last couple of weeks but also a they have been very very helpful in making sure that we understand the resources that are out there the people who are out there in our community on various issues some\nSo thanks to the bar association for for their help\nIn putting these programs together um [noise] I I Can't help but notice um you know that this community\nHas really kind of I mean we've seen more interest in this particular race and and this is I could be wrong but I think there's more interested in this race\nBecause this community is I think like a lot of people across the country\nVery keen on making sure that we feel like we understand what representation looks like and I want to kind of addressed that ran out of the gate here and talk about the fact that I'm In uh in many or ... maybe not ever has there ever been to a judge of color in the county wide judge position there's not that you're in front of me you're you're shaking your head no\nThere has been one judge of caliber over Thirty years ago on the more than\nMore than Thirty years so I I Want to ask because there's there's for candidates to women of color I Want to ask you if a if you think that that matters and if it should matter should it matter to voters should it matter to the community\nI think that it should you know the the bench has to\nBe represent representative of the community that it serves I think that's very important and I can tell you that I went to a forum last week I'm a forum on with African American males and at that forum they had mentioned to me that\nThey don't they feel like when they walk in the door they don't get a fair shake in court in family court and that's very important it spoke volumes to me and I think just as a whole we would served me as a whole if there was diversity on the bench\nMisery and I completely agree with the leak of that representation on the bench does matter I think about myself on to when I was\nA young attorney for appearing in court and often times I Would be the only person of color are the only attorney of color um on in the car and I I remember having to imitate it I felt\nUm coming into the court um and not seen anyone else that look like me and then I think about um people that I have a ... representing overtime and they've appeared in court\nAnd um there's an intrinsic lack of trust 'em when you go in and there's no one in the courtroom um that looks like you and they're deciding um some pretty serious issues they're deciding issues about your family about your finances um about your future\nUm and so I Believe that representation should matter to this community\nUm because optics do matter um I remember um a judge that I went to um her swearing in um for federal court um and she called out to her niece's on in the audience because she was the first woman ever appointed to a federal court scene and she called her and he says and she said you see\n'em you see that on T. is now doing it because of children don't see it they cannot believe that they belong in that space and I believe that everyone um belongs in space as such as the family court bench\nOkay well to be fairly me as the other candidates and ms Bailey doesn't matter if this county does not routinely does not elect\nHave color and is that a problem\nWell if I can just clarify one thing also Avon for one second a judge Caroline worse than as an acting family court judge she is I'm an African American woman she is elected in the city court but she has been\nAn acting family court judge for about three years and she's on the bench now in our county she has the backup youth part judge him in our county so she is currently a county wide\n... okay and I admit I'm confused what ms ... you're shaking your head was was is there a different the difference of opinion what\nI mean for me I guess there is a difference opinion she hasn't actually been elected to defend pushes an acting on family court judge at this point but she was elected to the city court bench\nOkay um so so go ahead\nI'm but I Would also add and I am in my children range I have two children who are Jamaican I have two that are West Africa and I have a child that's Dominican\nTo children that are Puerto Rican and children who are Caucasian and so a diverse it has always been incredibly important to me and diversity in our courts is important to me diversity in our schools and some ... to me but also experience is important to me\nAnd I'm running for the seat because I Believe that my experience with children of color with families of color with families from all different backgrounds will allow me to serve that community in a culturally competent fashion\n... was ... well I understand uh the points the other candidates are making I chew a focus on experience and I have Eighteen years experience in family court specifically\nI've worked with all different types of people have different races different ethnicities different religions different sexual orientation\nAnd I believe that contact\nMakes a difference I have the ability to work with different people no matter where they come from no matter what race they are no matter what country they're from and I think that's really what matters in in court as a judge you have the uh you are required to be unbiased and knew an on prejudice and I will uphold that\nNow so when when ms shepherd says an enormous ... Sheppard says the people of color could walk into court and feel like they're not going to get a fair shake or they can leave the experience feeling like they were either mess misunderstood or did not get a fair shake do you think that that's that I'm that there is merit to that or or or or not\nI think it's a concern that people may feel that way and I would want them to know that they will get a fair shake with me people of all as I said races ethnicities they've always had a fair shake with me and that won't change when I'm On the bench\nOkay um and and there's really do think a the court system that has ... and ... let me just because I'm now I'm not talking about ... kind of ... I Want to speak sort of hypothetically do you think a court system that has no judges of color\nOr even with all well intentioned judges Kennett serve a diverse population fairly\n\nAnd then I think that when we elect judges who vowed to be fair\nAnd as a judge who will be the sole decision maker I'm In family court because there's no there's no jury in family court we all come with implicit biases and it's important for us to deal with that and learned about that in order to really truly be effective on the bench\nFor candidates for Monroe County family court judge and you're hearing from Fatima read liquor shepherd ... Nicole Bailey I'll ask all of them to let our listeners know where you can learn more about them their background the record a website or way to get in touch with ms they would\nI have a website it's judge Bailey B.

up from Jeremy Jeremy wants to know um [noise] so Evan thanks for the conversations we just want to know if the candidates believe the people of color in this country are treated differently than white people direct question wondering what they think and I think he probably means in the legal system I'm\nJeremy second please clarify you didn't but I'm assuming with family court judge candidates that's what you mean and the legal system so we'll go around the table ms Baylor people of color treated differently by the legal system in this country than what people\nGenerally speaking are people of color treated differently in our in our judicial system or as a whole\nGermany didn't specify so sick the question however you want to take\nAnd Jeremy I would like to say that uh I Would love to be able to say no I don't know that that would be an accurate answer I Will tell you that I've been on the bench for five years and I've worked in family court\nFor a judge for three and a half years with another judge subbing in twice over the last three and a half years and I can tell you that in my court\nPeople of color and not treated any differently\nAnd in my court I Try very hard to listen to every argument if there is any argument that there has been biased by a police department are biased by litigator a biased by another individual I tried to take that into consideration\nI'm my as I said before my children um health from very different backgrounds racial backgrounds um religious backgrounds ethnic backgrounds and I can certainly say that it has been my experience that there had been times where they had been treated differently and their educational system\nIn different school settings and on the soccer field on the basketball court and it is incredibly offensive to me and I have made it my\nGoal to stop that behavior and I would not allowed in my room ... misery [noise]\nI Would reiterate that yes um you would like to say no butts through my own personal experience from representing I'm\nFrom representing different people and even my own personal experience um as a young attorney in court who I'm One of the pier in different courts have had the opportunity to appear different court from Niagara Falls to New York city\n... all over New York state um where um sometimes I Would often be um [noise] I Would often be thought of as a defendant and the attorneys I Would have to speak up and say hey I'm you know I'm I'm the attorney under this case I I'm not the defendant so\nI'm even though I Would like to say yes I Would like to say no I'm people of color on at times are treated very differently as a hole in the judicial system okay\nMa shepherd I Would have to say the same thing I mean I Would love to say it's not true but it is I mean you have to think of the history of this country and fortunately there's been racism in this country and I mean you figure out what the country with those on\nYou know I don't slavery we don't want to bring it up but that's what this country with the times that there is this racism um that is there and unfortunately it does trickle over into\nThe courts in a criminal justice system and that's why these races are so important you know your local races judicial et cetera because you need people up their care who are up there to make sure that the litigants who come to that ... I don't feel any bias\nOr for like they don't have that they're shaking court so you need people up there that don't have their not biased and able to treat everyone fairly here every case fairly and make sure that people walk out the court room film like they felt that their case was hurt and they were treated fairly good it was ...\nI Believe people of color have been treated differently in the courts or I don't think anyone could say that it hasn't happened it's the obligation of the judges and the the new judges coming in to do our very best to make sure that it's not happening we have an obligation a\n... to proceed with an absence of bias or prejudice not just within the judges but within a the attorneys and those are the pure and our courts so that if we see it we have an obligation to do something about it we also have trainings that are offered through a unified court system\nThere are monthly trainings there are workshops there's a training that actually takes place in the very first week of judge school for the new judges and there are issues of implicit bias and that's something that a needs to be considered\nBy everyone even judges that think they don't express biased because that's that's the issue with implicit bias so we absolutely have an obligation to move forward and do better\nOr I see the phone rang and we'll get to your calls in just second tip or emails if you're like a connection to W. S. excite dot org for candidates for Monroe County family court judge um mid ... mentioned trauma and I want to kind of go back to that because when you talked about making sure\nThat the people who come through your courtroom would at least understand and be directed to and have the benefit of the resources we have in this community\nSo often we hear that we are\nYou know resort resource rich but you know ... you know but um but sort of results for and\nAnd there are all kinds of barriers that that sort of prevent people from getting the help they need even if that help is available what's the role of a judge and making sure how do you see your work I'll ask all of you that question and how how acute is that need\nFor sort of trauma informed care and trauma informed judges sort of understand that\nUm I think that role is very very important um Evan and I think that it's incumbent upon us as especially family court judges to make ourselves familiar with what is available in the community um be able to partner with 'em as many agencies as possible and bring\n'em them into the court um uh bring them into the courthouse as much as possible I visited a court I'm a courtroom a family um\nWeren't room in California and um I mean even some of the\nUm agencies are stationed right inside 'em by inside the court house I'm so families don't have to travel miss work ... you know because\nIn general family court you know people are waiting for hours for their case to be herded there you know there there there's there's huge backlog and caseload in um for just to be trauma informed I think really is critical to their role in family court in being able to tap into those resources in the community\nAnd came as ... I think that we need to work very hard to make sure that our children especially on our cases that involve abuse and neglect have the right services\nAnd um what we can do with family court judges if we don't feel that they are getting access to the right services\nAs we can order the department of Human Services to make sure\nThat our lead against and our children are linked to those resources\nThere are times where families come into family court and we can all sit and say well they need X Y and Z but sometimes they need someone to walk with them down to negotiate whether it's the public assistance system or it's the section eight housing system or it's getting your child in the right mental health system\nSometimes we need someone to walk with us my kids have been through incredible trauma and\nI have a doctorate degree and it's very difficult sometimes even for me to get them in the right system and I needed someone to hold my hand and walked me through it\nAnd I think it is imperative that we as judges or to the department when we need to to get involved and to make sure that our families are linked with the right services ...\nI Believe that trauma informed judges come from being trauma informed attorneys so again with my experience in family court I've worked with many different issues and many different agencies in a number of these agencies do partner together and they join forces so they combine mental health\nIssues and substance abuse issues into one stop whether it's for the parents that has the issues or whether it's the child and again with domestic violence uh likewise there are agencies that will partner with the other relevant agencies to the family and all work together\nTo shepherd recently I had a very good conversation with a from a friend of mine who is a psychologist and she was you know ... to me the importance of trauma and how it plays you know how it affects the lives of little ... and children that come through family court\nAnd you know she was on this case and I had suggested to her I said you know maybe you might want to write like a report or opinion to the judge she said okay so she took my advice and she informed me that you know the judge was pretty happy that she did that because she sheds new light on the case\nAnd what what I can share that is I've been assimilated litigator which I'm On the court is I'm a civil court um I've been a civil litigator for well over a decade experienced in court [noise]\nUm and so the technical practice of law that something that I can do that you know being highly skilled highly trained an attorney um that's something I can do and it's in my work right now and dealing with families um you know a lot of the cases um child abuse and neglect custody issues a lot of dosing\nUse that are hurt in family court is what I process through my office I'm In Rochester city school district um at the chief of staff [noise] um and so I I understand the issue to maybe a different building but it's the same issues that I deal with every single day okay misspelling [noise]\nAnd then I worked in the Monroe kind of conflict defender's office representing parents in child abuse or neglect custody visitation child support and family offense cases from a wait till nine and then from two thousand nine to two dozen Fifteen I worked in the county ... department and children's services handling abuse and neglect cases\nAnd then since two thousand Fifteen I've been a law clerk for family or judge [noise]\nOkay I Want to ask you before the hours up just how you view the process of having campaign for a judge seat and you know we we talked about that last week with some of the candidate for state Supreme Court justice you know voters really struggle with those voters a lot of polls will say I feed candidates for for judicial positions I've no idea why I'm voting on this I don't know if I should be voting I miss\n'em get we're point I mean voters an inch remarkable and surveys with voters based their votes on that one of the reasons we're having the candidates here just try to introduce them to the community their experience their background their priorities\nOf ... but as it is strange ms ... to to to be running for office for a judge position and you know how you or have you found the process of how you found the process I guess\nI wouldn't say it's strange because this is all we know here in in Monroe kind of this and how we select our judges we elect them\nWhat has been amazing about this process of and as we have gone to meet so many amazing people and hear their concerns here their hopes here their dreams here their experiences\nAnd talk with them and I don't know that there is anything else I could do that would allow me the opportunity to meet this many people in here from so many people about their kids their families and their hopes and dreams for this community so that has been amazing\nMisery [noise] um I Would agree I'm the only thing that I struggle with in terms of I'm\nRunning is that it it's the party lines because there are ... Democrats and Republicans and um and to me um you know in in going through this process it's odd [laughter] only because of you would think veto since judges have to be very impartial and then\nFor the most part in my county the majority of 'em the judges um as he mentioned a non minority and Republican um for for decades um and so that to me is what I struggle with um but again it's a there's you know the arguments from both sides\nBump for appointing judges in electing judges but at the world we live in the world that we measured\nYes and this is all we know and I'm having a fantastic time with this race and just having my eleventh grade\nTeacher call off 'cause she remembers who I Am I mean that's amazing and just because this is why I'm running I'm running for\nFolks and community for teachers for parents for you know mothers fathers people it's just feel like they don't have a voice in court and they come up to me there is processed is excellent questions about the family court system and things like that and just\nWanting to know more about the process and just mean folks especially meeting the kids with the parades and seeing them and just their faces light up and just speaking to them some having a fantastic time when I\nWas ... I Believe this election process or the way it is currently\nGives the voters the best opportunity to really have their voices heard and to and to meet us and I have made myself\nAs accessible as possible I began campaigning at the end of January I have gone to every town every village I've gone to the city\nI've covered the entire county ... I've done my best to meet as many people as humanly possible in that period of time we had and uh make myself available so if people wish to contact me and and people have and maybe after today people will continue to contact all of us\nAnd ask any further questions that they have but\nThis uh it's been a great opportunity to meet many many people have a ton of events that are very very well attended and were able to meet a mass amounts of people at a time\nOr they spent ... association Nicole Bailey online where can people find more about your WWW dot judge Bailey dot com and it's B.

three W ... here in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for or you can email the program\nConnections that W accepts either that or there's a lot to get through ... let me start with some of the things that you've been focusing on recently you retreated bill crystals comment that quote the president of the United states has a Fox News problem and quote now I've said recently that\nI think we need to try to literally wean our friends and family off of cable news as if it is a a drug that killing them if we know they're they're they're on several hours of cable news a day\nOr do you agree with that and do you put Fox a special category 'cause I was talking about general not say there is not good journalist and cable news there's some very good journalist and cable news but I think our country does have a problem\nI I agree and and it's a all cable news I Would agree with that as well\nYou know when we first got cable news I thought wow this is going to be fabulous if you have twenty four hour news you're going to be able to get in depth into issues and areas and deal with subtleties in a way that a network news a dynamic or set of programs can't\nAnd it's proved not to be the case by and large\nInstead it is the desire to keep viewers coming back over and over again and it's breaking news fonts uh at the bottom of the screen sometimes at the top of the screen or in the middle of the screen when there is no breaking news but it's also a focus more on sensationalism to a significant degree\nNow we divided into tribal media it's true but I see a very sharp distinction between MSNBC and Fox\nUm Fox has an agenda and or in the programming especially in the evening but also a fair amount during the day and starting in the morning with Fox and friends [noise]\nThat is designed to whip up people and one of the things that I tweet fairly regularly and twitters become a kind of catharsis for me instead of just yelling at the television or at the wall\nOr the entire Murdoch family in ... including the children who try to stay out of it have some culpability in what's put on and you saw just the other day a after this horrific shooting in a in the synagogue in Pittsburgh\nLou Dobbs in his show on Fox Business has on a guest it was a repeat but they deliberately put it on who talked about the Soros dominated State Department and the caravan\nAnd Soros has become the kind of figure along with uh other people like a Tom ... or people with Jewish heritage who are brought up over and over again the Jewish bankers the global is terms that we've seen used before\nAnd Fox has exploited that and they make money from it but it is a very dangerous game now I'm not thrilled with any of cable news and one of the things that I find a frustrating with CNN for example\nIs that there's this sort of seem in television commentary that ah it's like the law\nThat the viewers are the jury and you have to bring on a defense attorney in a prosecutor and then the truth will emerge and people can make their judgment\nBut it's not like the law what you get is a Trump apologist on one side and somebody a usually a democratic strategist as they're called on the other I'm not sure what that term even means\nYelling at each other and what people come away with is believing that all politics is that extremes or what you get is if you bring on a say a scientist who says climate change is a real thing and uh it's manmade\nAnd then you have to bring on another scientist who says no it's not what the public comes away believing is that the scientific community is divided right down the middle when it's divided Ninety nine point five to point five so there's a a real problem I think just generally with cable news and thank goodness for National Public radio in shows like yours\nWell that's very kind and uh you know I I think without hyperbole I mean I think in many ways there's a lot of people who can especially look at older family members just I'm losing them to cable news I mean I'm losing out sort of their critical thinking but let me offer ... ... you know sort of a response to what you say about agenda\nSo when you say Fox News has an agenda in my mind\nMSNBC has a you know an ... an agenda or at least tends to support\nMore left leaning political causes whereas Fox News you might say well they support right leaning political causes and I don't think they do I think Fox supports the the concentration of power and the political hands of people on the right and they are a team sport\nIn which winning is what matters so I'm In I'm MSNBC it's more about interest in policy ideas\nWhich lean left and on Fox it's winning and beating the left which is different\nI I agree with that I also think that uh there are some other elements here on MSNBC even if there is a left tilt especially in the evening uh although some now during the day\nFacts matter and if the facts aren't going you're way there's at least some discussion and a willingness to entertain the reality that it's more complicated\nThat's just not the case on Fox I think what's happened is and it goes back of course to Roger ... is brilliant business model which was that you can find an audience on the right that feels grievances and it goes back decades and I think it's much more on the right than the left\nThe sense that the larger establishment in the media have shut us out and even though there are now more dominant force you can play on the ...\nGrievances over and over again and you get people coming back over and over again and you have advertisers who appreciate that\nThat is significantly different than what we see elsewhere but it is a willingness to distort reality not to report news when major news stories are occurring that are not ones you want to hear focus on other things Tucker Carlson is a master at that for example\nBut in ways that divide the country for your own gain and that's different I think than others I Do think the larger reality that you talked about people getting caught in this isn't just a Fox or cable news\nWe do have a problem in this wonderful world where people like you and me and Andrea can have so many sources of information at our fingertips in an instant you can find out almost anything\nBut for lots of others it's the ... and if you cook Kuhn in on things that make you feel comfortable which now you can do because you're not just sitting there in the way I was when I grew up with three TV channels and know remote control and Europe passive consumer\nNow you can actively choose what you want to hear and when you cook Kooning you develop your own set of facts\nAnd you are not going to be moved from those facts even if there's encounter vertical and overwhelming evidence to the contrary\nAnd what's happened is in a broader sense the danger we have in the society as more and more people move in that direction is that the whole notion of our system of governance that the framers created where you start with a common set of facts and then you debate and deliberate to reach policy agreement ultimately\nGoes out the window if you don't have a common set of facts and that's I think a danger that the position that we're in now that we see just as an example\nAre overwhelmingly with this caravan the notion that you have a group of people poised on the border ready to come over and bring as Brian kill Mead said on Fox News just today\nHorrible diseases and terrible are infestations\nWhich is simply not a reality\nAnd people are going to hear that and believe it and unfortunately as they hear things like that and believe them they may take actions that are really bad because they believe they're doing the right thing\nYou can look at the ah a pizza gate a business you know I live\nIn Washington DC or the comet pizza is a place right next door to the best independent bookstore in a I Would say even in the country politics in prose a place where people go with their families\nAnd the idea that it was harboring a group of child molesters in the basement\nWas just bizarre but lots of people believed it because it got repeated over and over again on social media\nOr in before I get to some phone calls for our guests with our normal Bernstein who is in Rochester or as a guest of the Jaycee and the Rochester Jewish book festival he's at the jaycees heart theater tonight seven thirty tickets still available and get them though if you saw the response around the country\nTo what happened in Pittsburgh there is unity there's interest in coming together there's interest in\nIn turning out and hearing voices and I suspect norms of it is going to sell out tonight I'm but he's in Rochester and that's why he's here I'm so before I get some phone calls a couple of comments from some conservative writers are ... that I'd love to get your take on first of all\nThe president returned this past weekend to calling the news media the enemy of the people and conservative writer mat Kelly this morning wrote quote Trump is playing with fire with his enemy of the people nonsense it's utterly dangerous an irresponsible Republicans should publicly condemn this rhetoric and quote\nSteve Steve's belief in the shooting of Steve's belief and a lot of the ah the targets were all Republicans I think twenty congressmen and senators\nOr this or was a Bernie Sanders supporter for Bernie Sanders continuously through the campaign\nUh uh just demonize are Republicans and uh basically I don't think he called Republicans Hitler but it it was a ... a lot of ... ... a lot of infighting\nGoing on by Bernie Sanders and this guy was a Bernie Sanders a supporter so I think I think the blame is on both sides you're really soft selling the blame on the left\nHigh so John let me ask you a quick question and all that norm respond here um would you agree with the premise that there will always be some level some small non zero number of citizens\nWho because of political fever mental illness ideology et cetera\nWill take to violence whether it's shooting Ronald Reagan whether it's pick any number of events yeah okay okay okay I Know my initial point okay so we agree on that so do you agree that if that acts\nThe number why is the number of people who might have been on the edge but became violent when they are the leaders that they support actually seem to support violence or occasionally rallies call for violence or support the kind of movements\nThat endorsed by violence the likes of which Bernie Sanders does not do do you agree with that\nWell a Bernie Sanders Casey was demonizing the or a conservative he was criticizing\nRight I Can't I Can't think of an instance where he called for um okay you know called called them Hitler but\nOkay so so you say demonize okay fair enough norm go ahead\nSo um let's posit that there are left fringe people and right fringe people yeah there are uh anarchists and ... on the left who have promoted violence in different places\nWe saw some of that are in a small way at the inauguration um\nThe aisle positive that\nUh I Would also say that you're absolutely right Evan that Bernie Sanders did not incite people to violence he used tough rhetoric against Republicans\nHe did not use are the kind of language that uh provokes violence in the same way\nIt was pretty tough though it out it's a tough but you know remember months later you have somebody who basically went to it on the edge could it could set them off but I Do the heck out of me\nWhat you know I I Would say if you go back and look at political rhetoric over many many decades we get tougher rhetoric a and a lot of places Ronald Reagan used tough rhetoric Tip O'Neill use tough rhetoric using tough rhetoric about a party and its policies\nIs not the same as using a kind of almost deliberate racism and anti Semitism what\nAbout Maxine Waters and some of the comments she made a Eric Holder recently said we're we're we're going to kick we're going to kick the opposition\nUh I mean this is I can I can give\nYou so many examples on the left and I'll tell you I think there's more examples on the left then they're right\nWell my my bike do we have the Hugh Hewitt comment so if you want to try to draw quibbling seat to what your what you just heard John Say she she went on MSNBC while talking to Stephanie Cutter had just as you can hear Stephanie Cutter first and Hugh Hewitt saying that he sees the same equivalency is that the caller joined us let's listen\nThere is no equivalent Democratic Party Iron Man screaming and Mitch McConnell in the restaurant there is Maxine Waters raining fall apart and they weren't highlights on let's say three five one if we go back to the study and we can talk about that but we're talking about\nThe president of the United states you have you know going off this man\n[noise] well so let's just make one other larger point here John which is the president of the United states is different from anybody else\nThe president is a a a figure who is listened to by people and the words of the president carry a weight that is different from everybody else I Would also say even first ladies at times have done that when a Betty Ford talked about her alcoholism\nIt had a huge impact on large numbers of people when she talked about breast cancer which she had millions of women went and got mammograms which they had not done before people pay attention to what presidents do and say in a way they don't for a candidate a senator a house member\nAnd what we have is a president using the kind of language\nThat justifies behavior and that brings people out of the woodwork in a way that we haven't seen before when the president said after the Charlottesville march there were many find people on both sides and we had literally neo Nazis they're saying and chanting Jews will not replace us\nAnd the people he was talking about we're marching alongside them with torches\nThat is a very different phenomena and it takes people and we have always had\nDark corners in American society people who believe horrific things sometimes people who act on them those who are unstable\nBut they're in the woodwork until somebody brings them out of the woodwork and this is a different phenomenon and to go to Maxine Waters one out of four hundred and thirty five house members\nAnd some of the things that she said I Would not agree with in the slightest way and I would not like but when you have a president who had every public rally talks about an African American officeholder as somebody with low IQ\nThat is the kind of language that brings out and invokes deliberately racism when you talk about George Soros and bankers and global lists which every Jew around the world has seen going back\nTo the Nineteen thirties and before global is has a dog whistle has a is a direct dog whistle and Steve Bannon has almost set it and that's what they what spin used\nThis is a Trump and these troops are bad when they come from anybody but they're much worse when they come from the president the United states and here we have a president who I think has behaved in a fashion different than any other we've had at least in our lifetimes and I would say going back much further\nAndrew in around ... next on the phone with Norm Ornstein go ahead Andrew\nHi norm yeah Donald Trump is really a quite a piece of work [laughter] hey look or you had a choice between um a Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and people wanted us to go\nYou know ... it it's um how can I say this people looked past like they did with the Clintons and\nAnd stuff they looked past all of the you know dirty laundry so to speak of Donald Trump and they they're worried about their wallets and they don't like to be over taxed and over regulated\nAnd that's so if if you want the Democrats to to run the country again I Would if you have any influence norm\nYou might want to write articles about don't talk about over you know\nTaxing too much on regulating and everybody out of out of business again that's\nA it's norm people are worried about their wallets they can look past stupid Donald Trump and stupid Hillary Clinton and all of her stories that don't make any sense does that make sense the an arm\nAnd er that's a that's a good point and one of the things we have in the book is a there are real grievances and issues out there they're not all economic ones and I think a good part of Trump's appeal was\nA large group of people and it's they're not just be a in red states it's in every state that there is a sharp division that we're seeing in the society\nBetween those living in metropolitan areas that are managing to not just coke but thrive in the global economy is higher education there is a supplement is there and as you move out towards smaller cities and towns and and then towards rural areas\nThere's much less of that ability and the sense that people have had that the uh intellectuals and the political elites have looked down on them and have ignored them and have as they've struggled have not moved forward\nAnd the financial crisis of two thousand and eight and its aftermath reinforced all of that Trump talked directly to those people and even if he takes actions that are not in their economic interest which is what's happening these terrorists are destroying a lot of lives\nCoal jobs are not coming back in the same way but people believe that he is respectful of them even if some of the reality isn't there and if Democrats aren't able to focus on some of these greater concerns\nAnd that includes not a focus on white working class people all working class people\nWho do what we expect them to do work forty hours a week and a ... do what the society ass but the social contract in return says you're going to have a house to live in you're going to have a a food to eat you're going to be able to educate your kids and if we are fulfilling that social contract and finding ways to do it\nThen both parties are going to have more difficulty so I certainly agree that Democrats have to pay attention to those things\nNow we're going to get a real test over whether people who felt over regulated", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "city": "Rochester",
