Washington I'm Windsor Johnston\nPresident Trump is taking to social media to push back against a scathing report published in the New York times NPR's Scott Horsley says the article reports that Trump and his family used dubious games to evade taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars in inherited wealth\nThan our time's fourteen thousand words story was a product of more than a year of investigation that shows that despite his claim to be a self made billionaire President Trump was the beneficiary of a vast inherited fortune much which was shielded from taxes through a variety of questionable schemes\nNew York taxing authorities say they're reviewing the articles findings\nIn his tweets the president does not dispute the facts and the article book describes it as quote a very old boring and often told\nTrump complains the vast majority of newspapers coverage of his administration has been negative echoing a charge leveled by the White House press secretary Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nIt's still unclear whether the Senate will vote this way to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh all\nThe vote has been delayed pending the results of an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against cap and all who denies the claims the agency is expected to release its findings by the end of the week\nThis year's Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to to Americans and a researcher in the United kingdom NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports they won for using evolution to design new enzymes and medicines\nFrancis Arnold works at Cal Tech but early this morning she was in a hotel room in Dallas texas sound asleep\nAnd the phone rang and at first step course I thought it was one of my sons were the\nProblems nope it was the royals Swedish Academy of Sciences\nShe'd been awarded half of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for pioneering the idea of using random changes to produce all kinds of new chemicals are enzymes so researchers can pick the best one for use in say an industrial process or a pharmaceutical\nThe process was it was a we had a hundred and forty five entries it we had a\nWorld class judging panel of the various expertise in urban planning an architecture in an expertise in in upstate New York\nEconomic development and then they brought that down to seven finalists we asked those finalists to refine their entries we gave them some funds to do that and then uh you know finally we\nWere down we were down to today and announced his two two winners\nOkay so you want to introduce briefly and then we'll we'll we'll explore a ... with the actual the firms that companies here and the people involved yeah so the first winner this morning that we announced that the Erie armada\nWe they won five hundred thousand dollars to make their uh idea or come to life and that's what we hope to to happen next year so I'm just going to introduce the team here from the ... yeah\nSo let's let's let's talk about what eerie our motto is as a first of all as a concept how it came together and I'll turn to a I'll turn to to Rory I worry McAvoy poorer poor Rory McAvoy [laughter] what is it like having a name like gory McAvoy with the global star with nearly the exact thing you're looking at that going on really\nUh that's uh I've I've heard it before I Know it's probably a pain in the U.S it's always want to [laughter]\nWorry and Jamie take me through how this ... the concept came together tell us about what the amount of as\nA sure we're we're I'm developing a waterborne programmatic events are on the canal and uh to differentiate it and to make it unique an authentic we looked into the history of the canal\nAnd looked at what folks are looking to do now I'm particularly as a destination event what would entice people overtime on an annual basis to come up and enjoy and experience the canal and oppression exciting way there was also reverential to the history of the canal\nA beer was such a important part of a the canal at the canal such an important part for the industry I'm way back in the day\nOr earlier this year a micro breweries have passed the record that was set in the Eighteen seventies or for the first time in large part of that um is a is held right around the canal area so\nMatching craft beer um the creativity and the small businesses are involved a along the canal a beer is a great component for an event um and then turn it into a competition on the water extending it to a multi day destination experience\nThat's where we landed and um we're really appreciative that we're going to be able to develop this now into actionable program and event\nWhen I work first watched the video for the year ... I thought you could probably replicate this at various places along the canal but what are the ... the destinations locations that you have in mind and be a specific you can for the public now that we're going to put this thing in motion well so\nDuring the you know the I ... I guess we we laid out a couple of options are one was located near Syracuse or one was a roam the Utica um there was\nA more of a capital region location but the idea really is not to be so specific the idea is to be able to have any place where you are Fifteen miles on the canal and you can have people have these festivals on either end\nAnd then have a really cool experience like going through a lock in a kayaker out or you know human powerboat is really cool things especially with\nPotentially hundreds of other people are really anywhere yeah fifty miles make now you have a lock or some other cool infrastructure that you want to highlight\nYou could do this so we do have some places in mind but I'm the ideas that replicated elsewhere and do a different places each year\nOkay so forgive me as ... when are we going to say that having a two thousand Nineteen probably third quarter fourth quarter yeah so I think ah October fest meets boat race October fest meets boat race and ideally if you did it in October is that too ambitious for a year from now\nI don't think so I think in and around saying yes guys are in and around in and around that time\nYeah it's it's not through and vicious um the idea is that this is an annual event that's a self sustaining overtime and uh like every event that grows and it reflects on a U.S past um but we're building this to happen next year\nWhat is the realistic attraction in terms of of numbers do you have those in mind for who you can attract how long they'll stay I mean are they in for a long weekend will become for um just the event itself\nAs conceived the event is basically a three day type of thing um that's kinda the duration as far as numbers it's it's hundreds but other than that already have\nSpecific on that yeah we were cancer the sky's the limit their physical parameters on ah you know accommodations or the mix of accommodations from self styled camping to be and be some location the first location that we're at all so the second location these are parameters that we are constrained by just physical\nParameters in terms of a growth\nI mean that's the great thing about a concept like this ah it is an event it's flexible it's not something that's just built and that's their capacity it's something that can flex with the with the demands and and over time you know how it evolved\nIt becomes an annual event yes that's an eerie armada and let's let's say twenty twenty five you guys have multiple years under your belt now set the scene for me what is this about look like take me through the three days\nI'll let ray [laughter] and I mean I started actually I think the first days of festival where you're going to have collaborations or maybe a local brewery with a brewery from another country or in the great lakes somewhere New York city on these are craft bruise some people are kind of coming for the beer\nTo for a festival um and a lot of these people are going to be actually participating in the race and I'm using quotes right now this is a fun race not exactly a this isn't a cutthroat competition among professionals this is a fun beer than grace um but then you also have members of the public\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comes from our members\nHave from ... a small batch ... brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what growl are available to go on line at cat ... dot com\nAnd you know I think a lot of people are going to be excited about this you're going to get a lot of a tendency put beer in a canal and together it's impossible to sort of have it go all that wrong but\nI think the question of what is it realistic return on the investments a fair one and sometimes taxpayers get skeptical about that to take me through your vision for why this is a kind of thing that does bring in what we call multiplier effect\nI think because as as a was described before\nWhen people get to this area of New York especially along the beautiful can now towns people love it and they had to return and and that's what we're really counting on on this by having this really cool event\nThat people who might not be a coming up to this area of our beautiful state you know people from New York City or tourists from other states once they discover that can now you know people naturally fall in love with it\nOK Rory what do you think uh yeah a following with that um\nIt within the industry and they fixed you know does this craft beer a there already is a willingness to travel to go try your favorite beer to try a new collaboration are limited release\nYou also talked about the importance of green space too I mean we can say millennials are really young workers workers of all backgrounds that's the only times sometimes empty nesters sometimes people from all different sort of parts of their life\nI think that's the trend that we're seeing here in Rochester there's a lot of talk about walk ability they're filling in an old dinner loop there trying to reconnect neighborhoods that were separated by various barriers over the years are you seeing it I mean this this concept seems to be traveling and that kind of what's going on here yeah\nAbsolutely we're playing on that and the fact that the Erie Canal I Am you know people are using it for recreation but I think there's even more potential to use it for transportation and so people who live in this neighborhood you know I I work in ... three miles away ... stood out are connected the Erie Canal if I Lived in the pocket neighborhood I could easily hop on my bike\nGo off shovel off road and get to work and so I think there's that dynamic to like not just for health and exercise but also to use it for non motorized transportation\nI'm coming up here I'll take some feedback from listeners if you want to call the program we're talking about the winners of this competition and a really remarkable ideas that they brought the that won a competition with what a hundred and forty plus different entry skill hundred and forty five hundred and forty five um but if you want to call the program 'cause we want to get us\nFrom our listeners is what do you think about number one and event like ... and a pocket neighborhood living on the canal envisioning this kind of space\nNot just sort of haphazardly putting up housing but really trying to envision what a a smaller neighborhoods surrounding green space would would look like\nEight four four to nine five talk do you think that there's more opportunity for this kind of space along the canal old industrial sites et cetera aid for four to nine five eight to five five or to six three to be ... in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for Gil can you notice is president and CEO of the New York Power Authority why do you think the pocket neighborhoods ideas to it's a great idea\nThe canals or own a lot of property along along the canal itself\nAnd if we could transfer the ownership of those vacant land may be former industrial land to a mix use and pocket neighborhood type development you know it's five hundred and twenty four miles of canals so there will be a lot of opportunities\nFor for this idea and it's such a great idea you know the the the judges of this competition told me how impressed they were with the skill and the imagination of a Jamie and her team and putting this plan together\nOn right on cue here's an email from a listener named Michael who wants to know who owns most of this the area along the canal to five hundred twenty four total miles\nYes a lot of the land along the canals and not all but but we do the New York state canals or own a lot of the land and so we we need to be creative as a state our governor has always said that we need to\nA re imagine I'm too on what those assets can be used you know historically we've built a structures\nHaving our backs to the canal or to waterfront and and we're really thinking about you know we ought to build a homes and businesses that face the water\nGo I remember was it last year the year before when I'm Jesse brewing had this huge tank and down the canal um and there was a it was funny you know that people would would get on their dachshund the canal and waving his thinking by or maybe drinking Jenny when they're coming by it and it was fun\nBut it felt more like a one off I mean are we ever going to see actual commercial transportation any significant way or is this a real fully reimagining because it's a different era\nYeah I I think uh it a commercial transportation really is the the past I think going forward it's a tourism and recreation supporting agriculture are doing the kind of ideas that we're talking about here today\nAnd Jimmy ... when we talk about this multiplier effect how do you view that from your perspective because again you get into this competition there's you know a good amount of money at stake here and the question is what can you do with that and how can you make a return on investment well\nI think what's so powerful for us is again you mentioned that you know we're a smaller community on and there's lots of small communities along the canal but with the reach of this competition I think that we can attract\nDevelopers from further afield on because of because of the competition the attention that it's bringing that can really come in and bring this to life\nAnd so that's I think that's what it means for us in one way of the multiplier effect in another way I'm as I mentioned if we bring people back to our downtowns they're they're the ones who are visiting the restaurants and shops and the breweries and increasing that foot traffic is just going to make our community so much healthier\nAnd another thing about it is you know you mentioned all the people that are travelling along the canal and sometimes you said you know you look over and you can't believe that\nThat states not being used as we're going to reactivate those spaces so as the millions of people who use the trail comes through it's all the sudden more lively and we want to integrate some public and then ... and components into these pocket neighborhoods to among the waterway\nAll right let's get her only break in the hour I've got some more emails from listeners who are\nUm one a little bit more of the ... that they joined later listen to mark want to do again once the beer event so we'll go back to that and um and we'll talk a little bit more about these winning entries just announced earlier this morning here in Rochester New York Power Authority and the canal corporation\nAnnouncing two winners and there are two point five million dollar global competition with a goal of finding the two best projects that would serve\nAnd spur economic growth recreation tourism all along the Erie Canal a hundred and forty five entries two winners and you're meeting them and hearing

story this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nThis afternoon at four welcome back to connections I met a Dusten should tell you the Jimmy ... who is assistant planning director for Madison County is reminding me that um they do have bridges in Madison County but they didn't have any books about it's a different method and kind of different state but you do have the boxing hall of fame in Kansas do this right the international boxing famous\nThan can start at the international boxing hall of fame and now of course a now of course one of the two selected winters in discount competition for re developing revitalizing along the canal\nOr a different Michael writes to us in on email says if I missed it I have a question or the pocket neighborhoods a single family homes around a common green space or are they duplex families double houses or the apartment complexes\nI'm so again the pocket neighborhood is a concept that's being done across the country and in some cases they are\nSingle family homes only like kind of more cottage style\nAh and our concept of the IDF the canal is we want to see it be diversified home so that there's a variety of different people living there in activating space so we've talked about doing um some single family some duplex says and an apartment complex in maybe eating leading in some live working unit so\nWho conceptualize this and I asked because you know you're here representatives project but there's always a lot of people involved and I wonder what the buses going to be like in a in a village like that for this\nYeah athletes that we do have a team I'm working with I saw that Madison County planning department but we um I've worked really closely with an architecture firm called stream collaborative based out of Africa and they've actually done a few pocket neighborhoods in Ithaca um they'll go out of pocket neighborhood\nAnd we also worked with ... associates to market steady to understand just exactly what the housing demand is in ... and the different price points and things so it was a team effort bringing a lot of different expertise to understand what we could conceptualize for this project\nBut but if you're telling me the truth I mean you didn't know until just a few hours ago that you won this thing um I imagine that the word is just starting to hit there and I wonder what the buses going to be like oh\nBut they're convinced that we can get people to successful event in the winter all year round and if we leave it at that parcel open for recreation it won't just be dead for three months in your experience can we do that\nYes you can um I I don't know if you have what went through festivals or went to gyms but that's a great way to activate in empty space in the wintertime or you can control aspects of it I Know you get snow if you're a decent amount but you can pump in snow this ... ...\nPartners from uh the uh in the state as well I'm a can or bring snow\nRarely pretty good with snow [laughter] and I just checking you can extend the season yeah people are really into the winter you can extend it okay and so in other words don't necessarily think that you could never get anybody outside\nIn the winter or you know it it it does get a decent amount of colder up here yet and dumped state or other regions of the country but um no I wouldn't I wouldn't dismiss it at all I think a winter activities are great to uh to uh to be outdoors\nAll right um and let me get one more question Patrick called into the program and we just wanted to know he's sort of grew up in pitch for he says when the canals drained its ugly how can we keep water in it so it's pretty all year round Gil well\nThere are times when we need to maintain back in the house and that struck\nJust part of the maintenance ... part of the maintenance but there could be you know in the future again one of the ideas are one of the entries today a conceived of us sort of a pontoon platform that you put over the canal and you can have either an ice hockey rink\nOn top of it or some other type of winter activity I thought that was pretty cool idea so certainly we're going to try and explore that and that will beautify the can outwardly sections on the canals if we can do that\nI'd go I Know you want to leave our listeners what the idea that things are growing and thriving you've got an event that are coming on the line with really seasoned ... thoughtful planners you have a community that's going to put a pocket neighborhood the kind of thing that we could see popping up in other places um [noise] but you know I I also wonder if um [noise]\nIf you're kind of going against the difficult tied here or if you think you're kind of settling into what the canals going to be for a long time here which is again away from the commercial shipping recreation maybe some some village in town planning around it what do you want to leave our listeners with is that is you think about the vision for this asset for for a long time here\nI think division is it will be a a primarily a tourism and recreation asked recreational asset it will support agriculture\nA and it's really a a source of tremendous possibilities we have we heard to\nA ... today the two winners in the competition but I guarantee you as we continue this journey that there will be ideas that we haven't even thought off today that happened with the high line in New York it also started with a competition\nAnd the winning ... the winning a entry was this guarded\nAnd just look at all the other things that happened between fourteenth street and thirty fourth street on the west side of Manhattan I Believe that this was even bigger because this is longer\nIt's outside and it's just water and it's fantastic and I I think uh I'm very very optimistic of of what's what's to come\nOf those seven finalist there were different videos online you might check it out you can do that do work in our lives are still take a look at a\nSomebody either at the New York Power Authority website or the New York state canals website or there's they are also featured in all of our social media

caucuses and was the polling favored early on for the Democratic nomination for president of course he was eclipse by Bill Clinton and eventually became good friends with President Clinton\nParking was merely a vice presidential candidate for different on\nThirty years in the Senate he is the author of the ADA miracles with disabilities and now in retirement he's still working working on disability issues he's in Rochester for a day long event tomorrow focusing on people living with disabilities poverty rates employment and more senator\nTom Harkin author da da da da da da to Roger says all coming up I was going to [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm winter Johnston presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway is taking aim at those who say President Trump mock the woman who says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers\nAnd a campaign rally in Mississippi last night Trump made fun of Christine Blasey Ford for not remembering all the details at times missed quoting what she said Conway says Trump was simply pointing out inconsistencies and forwards testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee last week\nThis woman has testified under oath hours for ... sake now you're getting concerned about the fact like efficiencies and then we got the fact that delay is not how much because people from all five different life are coming forward or telling their story\nSome Republicans are condemning Trump's comments Senator Jeff flake calls then appalling Senator Susan Collins says they were just plain wrong\nAnd internal watchdog at the department of homeland security has found serious issues at a major immigration detention facility in Southern California NPR's Joel Rose reports that's the finding of a report released today by the department's inspector general\nDitch us inspectors paid a surprise visit in may to the Adelanto detention facility which houses nearly two thousand immigrant detainees they found problems that show quote disregard for detainee health and safety unquote including news is made out of sheets and detainees cells\nWatchdogs report highlights the suicide of one detainee who was found hanging by bed sheets and notes seven attempted suicides at the facility\nThe inspectors also found that detainees lack time we access to medical and dental care and we're sometimes disciplined improperly the Adelanto facility is run by the GEO Group or a private prison company under the supervision of us immigration and Customs Enforcement ice has agreed to conduct a full review of the detention facility Joel Rose NPR News\nAnd I saw how he'd been discriminated against in a lifetime [noise] first of all he was taken from her home in a small town in Iowa sent halfway across the state to the Iowa school for the deaf and dumb that was the name of the school well it wasn't but that's what everybody called OK okay\nAnd so I remember a couple of things to my brother told me that stuck with me forever and that was I may be death but I'm not dumb uh and so you have segregated away from everybody in school\nOr when he graduated they told him you can only be one of the three things you could be a bakery shoot cob or or printers assistant and asking which one you wanted to beat each other and won't be any of those things so they said okay you're going to be a Baker he had no choice\nAnd then I saw how he was discriminated against and a lot of things for their shopping uh but he was determined to be independent he he was he was a strong willed individual that wanted to be independent didn't want any petty wanted to make his own way\nAnd um it was one of the first or a deaf persons that I Would actually get a driver's license because he was told he couldn't drive a car because he was deaf but he passed all the tests this would be in Nineteen forty eight I think forty up I'm Nineteen forty eight [noise]\nAnd so I saw that and so my first work when I went to Congress was mostly focused on the deafness communication disorders or and then ... when I was on the Senate floor and eighty passed I thought I Would give them the my\nMy speech on and sign language [laughter] it was kind of a funny occasion because I start speaking sign language well the court reporter had no idea what I was saying and\nSenator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska was sitting in the chair he didn't know what to do either and so there was this kind of flurry of activity down in the well\nWhat could they do like finished my speech that I gave it verbally but ah just kind of an odd moment in the Senate because no one knew what I Would say probably rebel authority of the challenges that people can face when all of a sudden very few can communicate you know\nThe other thing I Want to say about the ADA\nThis was a classic bipartisan bill\nFirst of all we had this great support of the prison United States George W. Bush he really pushed hard on this he stood behind it all the way\nIn fact to the point of pushing his chief of staff\nJohn Sununu out of the road and replacing him with another person to make sure we could get it through interesting story\nA so he was just wonderful and backing us up uh from from the White House\nUm one thing if ... if I could correct stuck in my mind over matter thing you should the chamber of commerce was opposed to it they work they were initially they came around boy yes they did that change the U.S chamber of commerce Congress actually supported the final\nFinal though there's all kinds of quote early on ... an F. I. B. the chamber of commerce warning that this will cripple small business will\nAnd if I may never supported okay never came around the shame or did they absolutely did a there was one leader or Tom Donohue at the chamber of that time\nWho decided they would ... well we worked out some we worked out we made some changes in compromises in it but they they did support it and I and and we got broad support from Republicans and Democrats across the aisle and I always tell people today about as fractured is our country is right now politically\nThis is one issue where there has in the past never been party lines\nWhere we can work together across the aisle to bring people together on issues like employment persons with disabilities which I Hope we get through 'cause that's what we're here for absolutely and that's why I'm focusing my life on it since I retired I decided to focus on one thing in one thing only\nAnd that is employment of persons with disabilities in competitive integrated employment that's the kind of a key phrase competitive integrated appointment\nNot segregated workshops not sub minimum wage jobs just like everybody else and we've got great examples of that over the country or we made some changes in the vocational rehabilitation law\nOr to um help get young people into competitive integrated employment that's that's the key\nWe've got a lot to talk about on that scale this hour in fact a Senator Harkin is going to tell us a little bit about what he's going to be speaking about in his presentation tomorrow at this event\nUm and for the listener so I don't know at times talking about when he says that the country seems fractured right now but will we will ask him later this hour a little bit of how he sees the current political landscape and how much he misses being in Washington I'm sure he misses the early these days\nBut before we get there let's talk a little bit about what's coming up tomorrow and Susan Susan Hetherington um I'll start with you give me the overview for what you hope to accomplish with the event tomorrow these heavy poverty employment\nAnd competitive integrative employment yeah\nThank you I'm so glad that a Senator Harkin has focused on competitive integrated and employment because [noise] uh\nBeing employed in a sheltered workshop or receiving sub minimum wage is not what\nWe want to be seeing it's part of what led to\nThe poverty of people with disabilities or throughout the country by him killer\nLay hair in Rochester we are doing this summer because we were horrified when we learn about the poverty rate\nCause by the unemployment and under employment of people with disabilities at strongest Center for developmental disabilities employment has long been one of our focus areas\nAnd we've been quite successful with a number of programs\nThe project search and ah we now have a job club but the reality is that the community that businesses\nAnd agencies are not hiring people with disabilities and until they do that poverty rate is going to continue\nSo with the summit is a problem solving day to both in form and work on the issue of unemployment and poverty\nAnd I will say both Stephanie in Jay do you look to me when I said when I was surprised at Rochester's rate\nBecause maybe I was hopeful I mean Stephanie Woodward of someone who's basis but on\nNational publications because of some of the advocacy work Stephanie reminds me every time we talked about this that could have been anybody who was demonstrating that that happened to be you\nRecently ah but I thought you know Rochester is your work here in Rochester there's a lot of emphasis and work on this and yet here we are with the poverty rate for people with disabilities in Rochester forty two point one percent in ... definitely looking into were not surprised you're not surprised\nNo I'm not surprised because you know segregation is a healthy sport in this community in my humble opinion again I can only speak for myself and I can only speak to what I Know being through but uh [noise]\nIf you think about [laughter] um let's talk about when you shop let's talk about when you're out and about in the community let's talk about when you're going to a public setting a restaurant how many times you see people with disabilities how often is that do you like I've noticed them you know my friends noticed in my family members and people who work with people with disabilities knows them because that's our life\nEvery day those are teammates that's what we're looking for when we go into different spaces\nBut those folks who don't have that connection how oftentimes as they see them because we're not necessarily given the opportunities or the platforms aren't necessarily shared with us in order for us to move up in a company move up an organization or don't even have the opportunity to just start so I have to\nWork my way up to an interview and then are in that interview and then I have to be almost the perfect candidate at that interview almost get that job maybe and if someone comes in after me that just you know had one thing different than me then I lost out because of what\nThe perceptions people have of me and whatever might share represents to them my chairs name is ... if I've reference Clyde anywhere do this that's what I'm Talking about\nBut ah you know ... is as part of my identity he makes me comfortable in the spaces that I'm In where I'm going to go and if I Can't come I Can't ... you know like there's places here I don't shop because they're not accessible you know there's all these other different things that I don't do because they don't line up with my moral code of life\nBut and a lot of the faces that were and we look at all the employers in the city there's employers who employ fifty thousand plus people in the city\nAnd when you walk through there how ... how many times do you see folks with disabilities you know there's other smaller companies and there's a local businesses how many of those local businesses are actually accessible like how many of them are actually giving people a chance now I'm not trying to shame anyone there are people who do\nBut what I'm saying is is that majority don't\nAnd when that happens is when you start talking about expendable wage well we don't have expendable wage so that's why we wouldn't be in your restaurants we wouldn't be in your stores because we have no way to make money\nAnd then you know if we want to talk on a larger scale issues we want to talk about systems systems we have in place sometimes hold us back\nI went to college I graduated high school um local so local all the way\nI graduated from high school in two thousand and I I went to ... it's not really local but it's close enough in my opinion to be local I graduated from Rockport and twenty fourteen and I have yet to find gainful employment where it's not just a year long contract or I'm not just a part time or or I'm not just a\nThen they do is we'll reasonable accommodations and that varies from business to business ... so that you can do the job for which ... for it so I think\nI think if we if we do those things and I have to mention was it came up over medicate bias a lotta times person with a disability\nAnd especially coming out of nursing homes and everything and then living independently right now in Medicaid if your Medicaid qualified person with a disability Medicaid\nMust must pay for you to live in a nursing home if I were ... I don't want them to the nursing home I'm capable of living on my own in a community setting and all I needed some supportive services Medicaid doesn't have to pay for them to prefer that could be a legislative\nChange goodness we've tried for a long time and we're still trying with the disability integration act ... poses a who opposes that\nWell there are some um nursing facilities that oppose it because they feel that it will cause them to shut down and we feel that people should have the right to the services as opposed to the setting for right now Medicaid as as a mandatory benefit is required to pay for nursing facility services\nBut not required to get the same services in the community so the disability integration act says that if an insurance company whether it's Medicaid or private insurer would pay for that\nNursing facility setting they must also pay for those same services in the community so that you're right is to the services as opposed to the Senate\nAnd again that's ... pretty logical and I want to put on us and yeah we have good data now after many years we have good data\nThat a state will pay less money and supportive services for personal the disability but living the community then they're paying for them to live in a nursing home so it's not a budget issue showing that there's plenty of data to show the\nEvan can I answer the absolutely mush and um I I think that um as something I'm Sorry I'm kind of losing my thoughts because it's just like what I Do [laughter] no problem ah\nBut I think it's something that has to happen in tandem I think what happens is we don't have accountability so I think that the legislation whatever it is I could come about I'm not a lawyer I study sociology\nBut um whatever it is that could come about as something that can hold businesses accountable I think that that's where we fall short\nOn when discussing implement for people with disabilities\nWere not holding anyone accountable as to why you didn't hire someone with a disability why it didn't fall into your diversity plan on why is it okay for you to ask people if they're disabled you know because these questionnaires do exist and I don't know where that information goes but I Know that I had to click that button in order to get further and your application\nSo there's things that I think and legislatively can happen to hold people accountable as to why they're not hiring people with disabilities but then in the in the community we also have to hold ourselves accountable for what we're not doing right so we have plenty of you know uh\nFestivals whatever you want to call in the community community events that aren't accessible or we have community events that aren't necessarily welcoming safe spaces where people with disabilities so we need to hold ourselves accountable for\nWhat we're not doing as community members um for people with disabilities because we're part of the community just like everyone else\nBut accountability has happened on both sides and in tandem it can happen with the community changing his perspective on something as basic as a community event and then growing into those spaces where money is being exchanged because if we come to you know if we think in reality we only really care about money as a country so when we start talking about dollars\nWhen I can tell you that it cost you ten thousand dollars to house me in a nursing home every month versus the two thousand dollars it might cost you to let me live in a house\nI think that that could work differently but when you've done this for so long uh you start understanding what the languages that people want to hear\nSo I've been an advocate since I was a kid I didn't have a choice my parents came to this country because to give me a better option my parents left Puerto Rico they're safe little haven to come here to give me a better option who knows what would have happened to me have not\nBut if I didn't become an advocate because they didn't speak English I don't know where I Would be so we have to address that and then we also obviously have to address\nThe educational issues that we have in this in this community you know kids with disabilities are being educated in the right way so we're not even producing candidates who have jobs so they're it's it's a lot of little issues that we have to address that legislation could hold people accountable because if you didn't do this this is what this is what happens to you in my opinion but again I'm I'm\nJust a so no I tell you it's a point but I definitely would were before we get ... break in the hour helped me understand who is standing in the way of this kind of legislation a\nWell known in Washington enough probably not I just got back yesterday [laughter]\nUm so there are people who are currently up for re election that you might want to um whether it's locally um in the house um or their ... thirty three Senate seats I Believe\nI'm reach out and ask them if they support the disability integration act and if not ask their opponents if they do and I think everyone one will be able to find out who really opposes this there certainly\nUm members on both sides of the aisle that\nHaven't joined under the disability integration act whether it's just that they haven't had gotten around to it or if they're opposed um but we are working on it and we are working on dispelling this idea that\nIt costs more to let us live in freedom because we believe it's a constitutional right for everybody to have like an liberty including disabled people and you don't have any life liberty when you're locked away in an institution\nAlright or as we had to break I Will tell our listeners we've got a couple of comments from
