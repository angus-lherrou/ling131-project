precarious\nIt's been a week since hurricane Michael leveled entire communities as floodwaters recede more bodies are being recovered\nThe death toll in Florida and other states is at least twenty

transportation quarter adjoining of the land for a possible project I'm sort of summing up here than the the decision making control can go to state transportation as opposed to local control\nThat them and also there were some I'm trying to make the wording was in possibly in the complaint and if not there than in the legislation itself or the memos that supported it or the term incentives owning\nA which is a type of zoning that's used in certain development projects the big and incentives zoning project that we all thought of first was the whole foods so that was a that was a tipoff there that that was what they might have been aiming this at\nTheoretically now before we continue with what we do and don't know I I Do want to ask our guests and and really you can all way and if you want if you want but when there is this kind of allegation\nIn which there's one name initially released into complain that's Joe Rico\nSo it's clear according to the complaint and the complaint says he acknowledged he did wrong to private sector I Want to make clear\nBeyond that complained he has not either himself or through his attorney that I'm aware of acknowledged at the same is that oh that that's very true okay I just want to make clear on that um but the complaint says that he did to agents\nHe's the only name here when they put this complaint out you've got your ... name but you have a mystery member of the assembly whose indicated by the complaint it's got some juice in Albany to get something done here I'm you've got an unnamed lobbyist an unnamed payer source of money\nAnd it's easy given the fact that our everyone's brain goes to whole foods to figure out who the opponents of that kind of a project maybe and you start making assumptions is it this is it that you start making assumptions on who in the assembly of maybe which given the fact that member a is not officially been identified\nAnd may not have been involved anyway as as Gary ... says might have never been involved or might have been approached and\nRebuff any efforts here\nI'm not sure this is all unfair and I'm not sure the FBI who cares about fair but there's a lot of speculation protected before an election I don't know how you feel about\nThat carry a ... you know I I\nHave done a lot a lot of law enforcement reporting through the years and and uh and I think actually somebody we all know Chris Thomas made this point on Twitter we had this conversational Twitter was you know well there's there's sort of the political rules and there is and what the FBI is looking at in ... I think the FBI\nI mean I Can't speak for them but I think if the FBI as told\nBy somebody in this case a lobbyist allegedly we know somebody in Albany that will take a bribe\nWhether right or wrong they they put the political calculus on the shelf I mean we are doing my job is those of us who got caught up in all this speculation and\nI did for days with people telling me that I had you on the line some of the opponents of the whole foods project had been implied that they were involved which I still don't see how you can find that the coverage but nonetheless it that's what I was told uh [noise]\nI mean it did lead to rampant speculation obviously in a lot of people you know who your finger pointing that a lot of people are just the FBI care about that I I Can't really say yeah\nAnd maybe they shouldn't you know maybe this is just me sort of being civic minded thinking because I'll tell you that the Veronica Vulcan myself we were reaching out to members of the assembly just to ask are you remember a ... just to ask the question is kind of cover now our assumption at the time was\nThat this is going to come out eventually end it's gonna be hard to lie very few people are going to say yes hands up that's me memory and let me tell you my role here but the idea was if you say no and this comes out you're in real trouble so we thought we at least had to cover our bases well some of the responses were\nNo some of the responses were how dare you how dare you malign our reputation is way how dirty even insinuate that this could be so lead to a lot of speculation\nBut I mean just backing up in in defense of who've who've never met member a may be ... you're talking about all we don't know which is probably more than we do know that we don't even know from the complaint of member a even got approached I mean right it's very possible the lobbyists just said not worth ...\nNot going to happen or ... again one piece of speculation is um you know that the lobbyist thing in your in your reporting it Scott ...\nNew to say if you want this legislation to go through a ... you can't do it this way you gotta you gotta sort of get a Trojan Horse to get it in there that looks more knock you as Joel Rio looks more innocuous start that way again that speculation\nYou know there's a whole other question you'd be talking about sort of the the FBI's role in this which you know wherever this thing will end and you are however to will and hopefully somebody will talk about whether on the FBI's end of the U.S attorneys and I'm really curious again if they were the ones who crafted the legislation which I think the odds are good what if it starts to move what do you what\nDo you have to go through [laughter]\nAmazingly I haven't even thought about I thought the legislation was so ham fisted that I thought I Know I Want to return to that question because I've not thought about that that's very interesting Steve do should we should the FBI should am I being sort of Pollyanna and thinking boy this kind of speculation\nCould be unfair to grass roots groups other companies or organizations and may not want this project you know when you were saying oh I'm sure you find it and I'm sure this is the assembly member when we don't know is that destructive\nI you know I thought to the extent that the that the complaint or the information that became available that first day pointed to a particular project and has turned out pointed to whole foods\nI just [noise] unfair I thought it was I don't I thought the same seemed unnecessary to me I mean if you have charged a this assemblyman with accepting bribes introduced legislation\nThere is no need to do anything that would hint that the legislation was aimed at a particular project when early wasn't you mean in the complaint yeah in the complaint oranges in from other information that was passed around that day I don't know what the point of that would be um why why would they wanted vanished\nRios one early charged with taking a bribe fears and I are are men and the Albany Joe Joe John Campbell keeps a list or database actually of of state legislators who have been accused of crimes or a serious ethics violations and since the year two thousand jewelry go comes in at number forty eight\nSo forty eight or some average or doing the math quickly my head almost three year I Believe\nA and um yeah and uh\nI Would have just for those of the last local person to make the list was the former occupant of the one hundred and thirty third assembly districts delayed bill ... who can was number forty one we'll get to him later for\nHim okay um yeah I mean certainly some of the reporting does we have a bit of a Web which will will get back to I Want to I Want to turn to kill you will for to help us understand if the FBI crafted this and again that's still an F Gary Gray you said ... do you say I think what you said that there's good reason\nThat I I I feel the odds are good I mean I I think the odds are good and I think that the uh you know those on all sides of the whole foods project or or denying any role or don't have any reason to doubt\nThem okay so if the FBI created this\nKelly immediately some people were saying oh that's an ... you can't just create legislation\nFor the FBI and see if someone will bite on it and offered the money to take it to Albany um you know that's that's different than the FBI investigating someone trying to push something corrupt but that's some creating a scheme from scratch but the answer is that's not ... let's talk about what\nRight so it's not necessarily a trap meant that the the FBI could\nBecomes this sort of the the instigate or in a way that may be a loaded word a sort of pushing the legislation in trying to find a link between ... exactly exactly that makes sense and now I'm sort of hedging I'm couching some us because as we've said there's there's things we just don't do that\nReading of the complaint I think that's one possibility that kind of jumps out of me\nOkay and from your reporting what is your expectation or at least\nWhat have we been made to believe that we could still\nGet out of the ... I think Kelly made the point that the FBI was very clear and very specific\nOn what the charges were um without being over broad and so they made it clear that they're not showing us everything they have they're being specific with what his permanent to Mr ... is there reason to believe that we'll see more out of this particular case\nWell I mean I I think if if the lobbyist was not part of the ... ... again to staying so to speak and\nUh working for the FBI now some there could be something there um you know the one thing I've learned watching you know federal authorities worked as a in this partly comes back to the the differences with state law which which Kelly knows better than ice criminal law\nIs there's a lot more sort of confidential informants are used on the federal side than on the state side and so you get a lot more of this\nCan we turn somebody and make them cooperate and hope there we're going to get to somebody else who's on our radar for whatever reason so I I I wouldn't be surprised if that was sort of underlying some of this you know and hope to you know somebody else might cooperate along the way 'cause that's kind of all the way these investigations tend to work over there\nOr is that fair yes absolutely I think that the federal law enforcement agencies work very closely with confidential informants on a regular basis it happens in the state court system and people develop confidential informants in the state court system but it is sort of the bread and butter of the way that the federal a law enforcement works\nSo it it is common place and and I just want to add that because it's kind of place this whole idea of entrapment is something that you're indoctrinated with as a police officer as an agent from the beginning you know to stay away from from situations where entrapment could could occur\nUm the law goes back in ... quite I mean back into the sixties I'm pretty extensively in federal and the federal laws that talk about entrapment being something that really can be a problem for law enforcement so they start from the very beginning of their career knowing the boundaries\nI'm ... and of course you still have to work with confidential informants so as you go through your career you have two perfect that idea of when you back off and when when it's when it's too much and um when you look at this complaint and one of the things that\nI that struck me as I went I stopped reading everything that was being published and I went back and I read the ...\nJust as a lawyer and I said you know what they did a fantastic job of not pointing the finger at anyone who's de ... de a agent who reject the agent who wrote the affidavit that's attached to the complaint um he did a fantastic job at not saying that number a\nWas involved in any way shape or hardly corrupt or possibly corrupt I'm actually leads to to the extent that you don't know if the lobbyists was working with the FBI or if they were working on their own and just happened to be\nPart of a larger staying where they now are seeing something go down and they were monitoring from afar\nWhen a great point because Mr daddy was who was not involved in indicated in the complaint who your sourcing indicates was the lobbyist has not been charged to lead off\nRight and assuming that uh you know Gary sources is accurate and and that is who he is the complaint does not lay out that he was working with the FBI\nThat he wasn't working on his own behalf with a a a private individual who was trying to secure this legislation so if you read the complaint ... it's a little bit less clear what is going on then once you kind of get into some of the things that are the Democrat and chronicle has learned through their investigative reporting\nUm and I think that that's a fantastic job of of um setting out for our community what is necessary to go after the one person they're ready to go after at this point for some of them in the ... assembly manner ego and it's not to say that there's not other things in the works you know that we don't know about\n'em but from the law enforcement perspective you don't want to expose anybody before their time\nYeah and that ambiguity is actually there for a reason with regards to everyone else besides your ego and I think Kelly as a ... a effectively convince me that I was being too Pollyanna distorted this hour up because that speculation has happened in the minds of journalists and the public\nBut the agents can't control that they can go after corruption where they find it and they can be very specific unclear about where they find it and to the extent that they're not saying anything else we're we're kind of putting those thoughts in their own ...\nRight and it does appear as if the original thought was to try to encourage or try to get a member of a ... to be the one involved now whose idea that was was it just the lobbyist on his own or was it\nWas it was eating feeding information round the FBI we don't know from the complaint but we do know that lobby from the complaint that the lobbyists then\nRouted at that routed the deal to or we go\nOkay so there you go so we don't know if member a even was approached we don't know if somebody with a lobbyist is\nGary in democratic chronicle sources are correct It's got ... we don't know it's got got yet he said look you want me to go after member a not a waste of time or we don't know if he's working with the FBI or working under that we have no idea what is it possible he was ... I guess it's possible\nYou know I think that's into to be fair and again a very short my sourcing on on you know the name but to to be fair to him you know that that's a possibility that's out there too I mean that that's possible to\nOkay so let's talk about your sourcing how it works because I'm you know newsrooms and journalists have different standards and these are very sensitive stories that um [noise] some people talk about three sources two sources independent sources what does independent mean walk me through\nA typically three and independent I mean if you know and uh if if somebody told somebody else and I talk to both of them you know the though it's not two sources those are not two independent sources I mean just to kind of in a in a condensed version to the trauma down\nI the name we ultimately reporter's got get it'd be the lobbyist again to be fair to him you know we we don't know if the complaint of you know if he was involved in criminal activity allegedly you're not just to be fair to Mr ...\nUh I I had heard that name probably within an hour or so after after jewelry go showed up in court that doesn't mean I could reported to the did I think it was accurate if I Do believe it was accurate uh but that that's my belief in a single source is not our sourcing standard\nAnd and you know and sort of continued to work that a friday morning and a woman you know they'll say Bob blonde very how to call them but that had some information there are some people say oh was he your short for the call them as well no [laughter] not W yours or something you know Bob Bob laws\nAnd and but I mean to be honest it did it I had different plan for friday I'll be honest and told that that column came out\nUp to then I said all this means all the media is going to be chasing what I was hoping that I knew you know by myself for a little while ... [laughter] and so my entire friday change admittedly\nI'm ... and to our standards that basically the ... you know three independent sources three sources and then do you know not not a you know and somebody who delivers the mail to them or something they looked at the male maybe\nA you know we reached that stand her I can tell you I I was working off site that day and there was a point during that day just write as friday yes\nUm there were other things that I had originally had in my story with note saying you know here's my sourcing with it I don't think there's one I buy felt pretty good about one that I said at right now I don't feel comfortable using this\nI did a a conference call with tech moss you know the lead editor I newsroom cared maggots and our top editor and and we went through and basically of the three things that I originally had in the story ... that was the only one that made it\nBecause we did not to our standards believe that I Do I Believe I probably right on the other stuff yeah but but to our standards you know we we did not think my information met the standards that we have\nTo be clear as other people in this town of ... things that you have not felt like you've got over the bar yeah very true exactly and there's plenty of things that you feel like you do know or at least you believed to be true based on your reporting\nYes and then ... and I've been wrong enough to to know to that's not enough so yes\nI I think that's so important by the way I mean Steve you could probably share stories as well as when journalists feel like when you've got two sources and you need a third and it can't be just the person who's desk is next to the second source I mean it has to be three independent sources it can be very frustrating and we're like oh no yes\nSo a little over a week ago I was working on the show that\nAwful limousine crash a over in school Harry I'm counting [noise]\nUm I think I was the first reporter probably anywhere to figure out that the owners are losing company was\nA noted and controversial informant for the FBI in cases where entrapment had come up as a as a defense or you know maybe ten years ago or so he was a well known informing he owns a company\nI knew that but the and you know through documents through legal papers through news stories I had no question in my mind that that was the guy\nThe problem was is that meaning that the informant was a person who owned a limousine company\nAnd um but he's never been criminally charged other than the unfortunate\nBattery case involving a woman in Albany or the ... you know it's just a an angry argument that turned into a\nOf a physical altercation yeah there's you know um\nBut you know uh but his name has come up a lot in connection with these things and he's always denied anything improper and he may well be right but\nHis name does keep coming up and it would be you know I'm curious to see\nIf that goes what happens with that perhaps will ultimately be cleared a were\nTurned out to have been helping the FBI I mean we don't know\nBut that's looming out there\nFor sure I mean and and again you know in a uh obviously I mentioned Mr Gettys name of the paper you know as Steve said he yeah he was involved with a school modernization plan who who knows if perhaps he was working with the FBI in a way to do we do on earth corruption in the school modernization thing who knows I mean maybe you saw it and could have been working on that by half we just you know we still just don't know to this point\nMary an email from a listener named Jesse says\nI've been fascinating stuff but there's one question that has not been even asked this hour why would an assembly men who makes good money and I'm assuming has a good retirement\nTake a small pile of cash let's be honest it wasn't that much what was it a thousand dollars three thousand five thousand why would he even take it from Jesse Gary ...\nUm I think ultimately told her about five thousand but I guess my my answer would be why would any of the other forty seven probably I mean admittedly some of those were larger amounts of money then we're talking about here but I haven't been in the courts a lot a ... and again\nI didn't want to we don't know if his guilt so let me or guilt or you don't know the skill and and we can only speculate why I mean I just you know I\nRead the greed seems to have no limits with dollar signs\nI mean I I've seen people come into federal court and Stephen I had a good friend John nickel ... major major appraisal fraud major major praise will probably the biggest cases western New York who was nickel and dime and his taxes you know basically to save money on the meals he was ... and so\nI I nothing surprises me when it comes to what people will do to tell you the truth\nOkay I'm ... and again to answer Jesse's question a little bit more squarely though nothing in the complaint gives any indication to understand why someone would oh it's very true\nVery true and it does as we mentioned does this complaint does include a the assemblyman allegedly apologizing for what he did in acknowledging that it was wrong they quote him saying\nThat sort of thing but Jesse there you're not going to find anything else there that ended in indicates he was needed money for X Y or Z or whatever I mean we don't know we know anything about personal finance has been writing about motive no idea but to Gary in Steve's point it it really is remarkable broadly speaking not about Joe Rico what people will do\nWhen you know when they really don't have to and when when my reporting in and certainly all three of folks at the table have worked with people in our community who are truly in poverty truly struggling truly cannot pay a bill truly have a hard time seeing a future\nTo think about something like ... you brought up\nWho will never who would never have had to worry about anything\nStill willing to break the law nickel and dime to save money on a meal here bill their tax bill it's amazing but but sometimes it's never enough so I'm Jesse thanks for that but I'm Joel Rico specifically nobody knows I'm Down to our last minute or so so Gary ... or\nAnything forthcoming that you want to tell us about the Democrat and chronicle I guess the answer is whenever your sources tell you\n[laughter] well hopefully I can accomplish some reporting without my shorts [laughter]\nUm yeah I mean as far as this case is imminent no not I I mean not that I Know of and I don't know it could be I mean that it could be the next hour and I will find out probably when the press release lands on my desk then you might want to be in federal court you know but yes I Know nothing eminent right now\nOkay anything anything that's on your plate\nOf plenty on my plate but nothing to relate to citizen how\nThings are going to talk about it on the radio and Kelly I Want to thank you again for for not only come in and offer your\nLegal expertise but I I Want to close by asking you to kind of reiterate or thirty seconds you think that does so far law enforcement comes up looking pretty good here\nI think based on what we now from the second plane they had done their job they have investigated the case they have also kept people\nOut of this complaint who they have chosen not to out so to speak at this point um it's very straightforward and it will have to I'll watch it play out in federal court and to see if\nThey in China defense even comes up on it may not come up that they may not have that he'll marry 'em so it's a very interesting case I understand everybody has thoughts about it but I think we all need to watch it play out\nNow you changed your mind at it and a sort of people like the job no one will change their mind anything and in the world anymore but that's not true ... and Kelly will produce an attorney with powers in Santo or a partner with powers and ten told him made some really compelling points about the way this case has been handled\nAnd I it it has changed my view and thanks for being here with a free shut that if you think you have to Gary in Steve a free she had to work you're doing the Democrat and chronicle thanks very much for coming in shutting down here ... did you get uncomfortable at all [noise] no not really [laughter]\nI told Garry I was going to make I was gonna ask him questions and he could not answer just on purpose to making stepped in much more can actually coming up [noise]\n\n\nThis program is a production of W ... public radio the views

from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh President Trump says his administration may know by the end of the week what happened in the Saudi conflict in Istanbul or Washington Post columnist your mouth because she'll gee was last seen alive more than two weeks ago because show jeeze family and friends fear 'cause show he was killed by Saudi hit men loyal to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nTrump says he's waiting for the results of an investigation but for now the president is affirming the US's strategically critical partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey are of allies we have other worries with allies in the middle east but if you look in Saudi Arabia they're an ally of there was tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things\nThe president has also previously spoken a lucrative business deals he's made with Saudis in the U.S before he was elected\nRussian investigators say they believe in Eighteen year old students shot and killed Seventeen people at his vocational school in Crimea before he took his own life and here's Lucy and Kim reports from Moscow Russian authorities no longer suspected terrorists ...\nRussian authorities first said they weren't ruling out terrorists but re classified the crime once details became known president what emir ... who is meeting with as he ... counterpart Abdel Fattah el Sisi\nHold a moment of silence and expressed his condolences to the families of victims school shootings are rare and the former Soviet Union due to tougher gun laws premier became heavily\nMilitarized after Russia seized the peninsula from Ukraine and twenty fourteen Russia annexed Crimea after occupying holding a referendum that few countries have recognized Lucian Kim NPR News Moscow\nThe Trump Administration is pulling out of another multilateral treaty NPR's Brian Naylor says the U.S is serving notice that will leave the body that sets international postal shipping rates\nThe universal postal union is one hundred forty four year old agreement the Trump Administration says it gives an unfair advantage to foreign shippers contending it's cheaper to send a small package from Beijing to New York than it is to send one from San Francisco to New York\nSo [noise] I agree with both Iran and Ronnie um it's not clear to me what her motivation was in making this assertion uh it seems pretty clear that\nUh there was not a point in in her career where that was used to her advantage a\nFox News I Believe just a couple of days ago released a report that showed that a Harvard did not actually give her any benefit as a result of this assertion uh she wasn't preferential be admitted et cetera\nSo I think she probably didn't hurt anyone um however uh by doing this and and\nUh asserting it in a political environment that's is charged as it is I get it pulls\nA the the very damage Native American history into the political arena and so all of us are are now like well gee so how much Native American are you in in all of a sudden these questions are being asked to those of us that are either\nA involves a enrolled or otherwise directly active in native communities and and that's not really what we should be doing we should really be focused on uh doing what we can for those\nIn and let me just follow up briefly with Roger when when you say it's not clear that she or her Columbus that has hurt anybody\nI think there's probably going to be it's probably going to be impossible to know for sure and the reason I started by reading the Fordham law review is if you're a Harvard and you have a dreadful record an hiring women of color people of color [noise]\nUm you know maybe you would have hired Elizabeth Warren anyway and that's their claim and their claim is they hired her to consider her to a white woman at the time they hired her on the merits okay all well and good at some somehow she was promoted as a woman of color and we do know that in the previous year she wanted to be listed as having Native American heritage so at some point\nHer decision to focus on that in a professional contacts did lead to Harvard to signal to Fordham in probably everybody else hey at least we've got a woman of color which\nYou know what to also be honest to organization sometimes field they pat themselves on the back when they hire one where they had zero and ... and so I I'm not sure that we possibly know exactly that nobody was hurt his controlling it sure is that fair\nYeah I think that's fair um keep in mind that ah these institutions or universities I worked for a Jessie what's that are under a lot of pressure from the federal government to demonstrate that they're not discriminating they've got good diversity et cetera so there's a lot of pressure\nUh they are typically the ones that are responsible for defining what they mean by diverse uh and so they set the bar that says a must a Native American person a bee in roles or can they simply self identify and that clip level changes the results that they get\nThat's not something in our control that's a federal government controls imposed on everybody\nA and it's not something that that we work with\nA so sure on those things are probably have\nHave had some impact as her career move forward um but she's working within the parameters of the environment that she's been handed a as I said the universities are are given these measurements and they have to work and within those parameters as well\nNative Americans are a tiny fraction of the country we we are not a large population by any means\nAnd so on identifying people that have that background or that have the skills or that matched the qualifications necessary for a a technical or professional job\nThat's a rare thing and when you find something like that you typically wanted it to grab onto that and and and hope that that's that's the right thing to do\nJordan agree or disagree with your dad\nA well the weird position to be put in but I'm going to have that kind of disagree to you on that um\nWay to go to Jordan no disagreement their parents that's why I thought it would be easy to go ahead okay cool great\nYeah I'm the problem with all of this is that it's Native American identity is such a complicated issue in general because it's\nIt can ... so many different things you can be Native American um and or you can have the Native American ancestry without being involved in the community without having\nSort of a typical native experience growing up um you can be involved in the community uh like myself but you've had to fight for and you've had to sort of reconnected that opportunity because I was raised in South Florida where there is no mohawk population are up and occupy population than I had to like\nMove to New York and reconnect with my community and kind of rediscover those uh that ancestral I guess roots\nThat's a weird way of putting it but like the last ... that a cultural connection um you can be\nA enrolled in the community and like um beef\nLiving in the city you can be far away from your community itself can be living on the reservation so the concept of like in sort of singular idea of a Native American identity is a really difficult thing to nail down especially because of I guess sort of are\nPretty unique political a situation in that we do have were asked to prove or ancestry all the time almost every time someone meets me and I tell them that are Native American there's always this question of how much and that's a really weird thing to try to answer because\nI'm native mohawk but my mother's Jewish my dad's ... and I consider myself I'm mohawk and I'm involved in the community of learning a language that the same time there's always this pressure for me to try to prove myself I'm Elizabeth Warren has\nTo my knowledge not been involved with the community and I think she goes on that's or explains that too that she has that ancestry there and you know that's fine but\nIf I had that way is is it's sort of ... I forget who said it I'm Sorry I Can't see anyone straight through the phone but I'm someone did say that um\nA it's frustrating because it's such a difficult thing to assert yourself as a Native American in modern society especially if you\nDon't look native at a very typical sense um and to have someone say like no but I'm Native American um and kind of received benefit for that even in a or even to have like an organization say like look at this we have a person knew\nFor all intents and purposes looks white a lame Native American heritage and received this sort of booth to there for the age that way I guess you could say a without actually going on to\nLike sort of taking the time to really find someone who is an actual person of color and hiring them\nYeah I think they should and she she did your rights she ... she has not said that she has connected throughout her life I'm actively with the community she's just acknowledging part of the heritage professor over what do you think\nI I Am I'm so disappointed in and Elizabeth Warren and and I I think the comments you've heard here [noise]\nTaken together really get to a lot of the key issues across a very long history and I think it's worth keeping in mind that that in Canada\nAnd in the United states both of these these these countries sought to eradicate American indian identity the Indian Act and marrying out in the sixties scoop and and and in in Canada boarding schools\nUm things like that and and and so\nTo have Warren come along and and and essentially play Indian whatever she did she was essentially performing in a way whether she got benefits they're not um I'm not inclined to be very very forgiving for that and I think she has some some\nDamage to undo and and one issue that I haven't heard people here bring up that I think it's worth talking about is that one of the one of the things here ... native nations are different than other ethnic groups in racial groups the United states and and one\nAnd I don't think there's another ethics has just spent so much time proving who they are right ... the kind of questions that Jordan scouting right how much or or or stuff like that it's\nIt's an old old problem the\nOther thing is that native nations our nation and that nationhood predates the existence of the United states that you look at the United States Constitution we want to pretend the constitution matters doesn't seem like that very much anymore but [noise]\nArticle one section of the United states we the people gave to the United states government's right to regulate commerce with the Indian tribes that nationhood matters\nElizabeth Warren has claimed Native American heritage no Native Americans claimed her she's not a member of any kind of nation and I think that that matter significantly and you know I I I don't want to speculate too much about what she was thinking it seems that she wasn't voted into um [noise]\nA much like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football that Donald Trump goaded her into doing something that wasn't her best interest she gave a I thought a very good speech in February twenty Eighteen to the national Congress of American indian [noise]\nTrying to put these issues to rest and in her damage control subsequent to this this DNA testing she said much the same thing she said and that that and see a speech but but it is damaging\nTo talk in terms of blood and I'll give you give you one specific example just the week before last a federal district court in Texas ruled that the the Nineteen Seventy eight Indian child welfare act was unconstitutional\nThe Indian child welfare act as one of the most significant successful pieces of legislation passed by Congress in the last fifty years one of the most important the Indian child welfare act was designed to protect native nations\nFrom the scourge of of breaking up native families in separating Native American children from their from there from their tribe clan nation and family is an immensely significant piece of legislation based on the fact that these are native nations the the the district court in in in uh Texas case\nWhen you go to Georgia decide to run he wants to just add to that God yeah\nI Would like to see I mean if this is something you know that she's really trying to lay claim to for her to really take a vested interest into why really affects our native populations here today and a lot of it largely from argues is unfortunately this ramp an epidemic of suicide\nThere is a I mean this suicide rates for our native use here on a turtle island to mean really in in the U.S and Canada\nAre unprecedented and and it's really unfortunate and the other concern to for missing and murdered\nIndigenous women this is another\nHuge um unfortunate aspect that is happening with in our communities that gets no um no\nNo coverage at all so if she were really vested in really you know wanting to to kind of you know take on or take some part ownership today than I Would love to see her get involved in those types of issues and coach Jordan\nYeah it's funny I'm I'm actually pretty self conscious about my cheek of Iowa\nBecause it has to start looking at your funding beside the hard way [laughter] I uh\nI uh it's such as like stereotypical Native American like saying that everyone's like oh yeah I sort of see it because of your cheek bones and I'm like ... the\nThe natives experience is so different than that it's not just that one body part of it is the thing that everyone seems to reference whenever we talk about indigenous issues in that like okay this person has high cheekbones so they're probably at least\nSome Native American I guess or something like that and it is a very difficult thing to\nEncounter over and over again just sort of have that your entire experience\nThere and you know culture be boiled down into just one body part I'm and going out for my dad says I uh work with wilderness education and I actually recently\nHad a co worker asked me about how their organization was a train native peoples\nBecause often go to know about and they were they talked about how indigenous people will use plants in the area that cetera et cetera and they show these like photos from probably the twenties or something like that of the indigenous person doing some sort of\nCrafts um with plant materials and basically what they wanted me to say was the way they're portraying it was wrong and I kind of tend to agree I think it's sort of having these\nHistorical photos of native peoples working with a plant material um\nAs what people are as people's only exposure to Native Americans\nIs really harmful um I work in the wilderness education because I act as we do love being outside\nAnd working with children but\nI'm often times I feel like uh people are asking me to sort of be that representation of a Native Americans and the reality is um a friend of mine said this really well one day back in the Fifteen hundreds Europe was the really hard to science is like metallurgy art architecture et cetera whereas\nThey just people's go really hard into um the natural world sizes and we got really good at it to the point that we're slowly catching up the knowledge um native peoples had for hundreds of years we just discovered that maple syrup has all these health benefits um and we've been calling maple syrup of medicine for\nEver [laughter] um and I do want to be a part of my goal is the wilderness educator and a native person it's like he mystified Native Americans do the minds of USA Today because it is such a different\nIt is in many ways like just an ethnicity and that sort of a weird thing to say I think especially in such a loaded context but we are human beings are people with experiences that differ from other people because you know that's\nWhat the human experience it's a and I totally try to assert\nThat over and over again and so when I hear Elizabeth Warren talking about like\nMy experience as a Native American or for her speaking her experience the Native American\nUm is hearing about her cheekbones over and over again is you know it's just it just doesn't match what\nI was feeling where when I was growing up it was hard being in Florida and knowing that I'm ... and not being able to like have that connection not knowing anything about my language and that's\nNot to say anything you know against my dad who's right here\n[laughter] but I'm also but it is\nKnow that was my experience growing up as saying like God there's this part of my culture that my dad is like in parting on me in teaching me and and I just don't see it anywhere because I'm In Florida [noise]\nUm and that for me was my growing up experience the native person I'm an district a indigenous peoples Davis here I was talking about uh my dad's experience as a kid and hearing the stories he\nGot to hear from my grandfather and what you know just some of the stories I heard from I doubt about that and it's it's just a different experience than just like\nThis is what body part you know it's a little bit but I've I've got a ton of email and calls to get through so for the rest of the hour we're going to try to work through some of the reaction we're getting I'm going to start with an email\nLear writes to us and says I'm Sorry I Can't even listen to this conversation it's crystal clear to me that ms Warren's current claim is nothing more than she had a Native American ancestor white guy claimed to be Swedish Welsh and German based on where my ancestors came from and then she took the DNA test to prove that fact and defend yourself from the liar in chief\nAnd his attempt to have his own facts that her expense\nAnd the discussion to me anyone who's making Warren's claim all about themselves and their identity is just also using this stupid controversy to get attention for themselves and some agenda of their own I'm well aware of the genocide of continuing massively unjust treatment of native peoples in this country but that has nothing to do with the stupid argument that's from Leah\n... been very critical of Senator Warren live thinks is all blown out of proportion and that we're missing it what would you said earlier\nYeah I I I kind of reject the premises of the of the email I don't think people are making making taking advantage of this for their own agenda I think a senator winds\nEffort to respond to President Trump's taunts raise\nSome serious problematic issue native nations are under siege and again it I think that that that fundamental constitutionally recognized fact needs to be kept at the forefront that Native Americans belong to native nations\nSure she claims are heritage sure she was trying to counter that Trump's nonsense and it is nonsense and it's terrible\nBut native nations are being obliterated by the federal courts right um you know Romney mentioned are missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and and and and these continuing problems right and what not a historian one could write a history\nOf of Native Americans from the arrival of Columbus to to day\nUsing the the mistreatment of Native American children as the thread weeding that narrative together missing and murdered indigenous women going on the foster care debacle in South Dakota I'm continuing problems in Canada with young people killing themselves in these residential schools\nIt these are significant issues and uh and while I agree with the emailer that that Donald Trump is terrible and and I agreed to a certain sense at the center one was just trying to get out of that you try to put it to bad once and for all center one probably thought Monday was gonna be a great day [laughter]\nBut these are big issues so to your phone calls we've got we've got a lot to get through and our guests are going to have a lot more to say on these issues Dan in writing his first go ahead Dan\n[noise] oh I have a lot a lot of guy that's unfortunately one is that Jordan is Jewish Jewish law and in my checkered career I run across several people\nWho are Native American ancestry ... and the long to synagogue so any synagogue in Rochester I'm sure would welcome Jordan or I'm a Jewish youth group\nUm secondly even at the height of I'm Jim Crow\nAt first I didn't have to have at least one great grandfather great great grandparents it'd be ... considered black\nAnd these people and she's got less than that and Hitler who was one grandparent to be considered Jewish\nUm and I have very high cheekbones and I'm sure I don't have a drop of a Native American is DNA and my uh chromosomes\nDan I interrupt you I have no idea what you're trying to say here though\n... who just random comments\nAbout how silly this whole thing is it's silly okay so uh but when you say well Jordan is is Jewish by Jewish\nOr law what point are you trying to make then that he can be both groups okay I'm On my right after like it I\nSort of self identified that way or whatever ah people ask me about my ... my racial backgrounds that I'm bi racial\nOkay Dan I don't really know where else to go with that um but\nYou know what what's that let me go ahead and um take us to come and I got from another listener who is asking um", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "year":
