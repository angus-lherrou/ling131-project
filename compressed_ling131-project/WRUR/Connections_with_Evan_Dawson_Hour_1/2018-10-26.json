Republican on the ballot just a few short days we reach out to all candidates for prominent federal state and local office we've had a number of the candidates\nFor governor to this week and this is your chance to hear from a candidate for governor and your questions and you can email the program connections of WXXI set up for you can call this hour\nWe'll talk about a wide range of issues affecting New Yorkers the Republican in the race ... fresh off his debate with Governor Cuomo\nStudio commission [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi saying the Justice Department says one person's in custody in connection with suspicious packages including confirmed letter bombs address a prominent Trump critics across the country NPR's Ryan Lucas has more\nA law enforcement official tells NPR the individual was taken into custody in Florida where some of the twelve known suspicious packages were discovered no further details were immediately available on the individual including the suspect a connection to the packages\nTV footage from the town of plantation and South Florida shows officials from the FBI NYPD and other law enforcement agencies put in a blue tarp over a white van in a parking lot to talk of the vehicle away\nThe Justice Department has scheduled a news conference for this afternoon to provide more details on the case Ryan Lucas NPR News Washington\nUNICEF says it's working with Mexico to care for the migrant children who are part of the caravan of Central Americans traveling north to the U.S border it says the children need access to health care clean water in general protection on the long Journey Through hot temperatures and rainy weather\nThousands of people make up the caravan many say they're trying to escape poverty and violence in their home countries but it's an surgeon what they will encounter if they reach the U.S border the Trump Administration has ordered hundreds more troops to support border patrol\nOr already more than two thousand members of the national\nGuard at the border the U.S economic growth is still robe us the latest numbers from the Commerce Department reflect that NPR's ... says the economy grew three and a half percent in the third quarter\nThe increase in the real gross domestic product is more or less what economists had expected it shows strong growth driven by consumer spending and government spending\nQuarterly growth was not as high as the blockbuster numbers we saw earlier this year when GDP grew by more than four percent in part that's because of changes in international trade as terrorists can\nAnd spoke for an hour a day and I don't think quite frankly ordered or offered a single substance idea\nFor where New York or at least upstate New York should go in the next four years now as a journalist I Will tell you I think anyone who's on the ballot ... should have the chance to be included in the debate Stephanie minor that means how we Hawkins that means Hillary sharp you agree\nI agree uh and we are participating in one uh with all of the candidates I Do think there's legitimacy to suggest that ah [noise] um you know sort of like the presidential\nPolicy that that at some point there needs to be at least the debate among those who are are likely to be the most competitive in the end and quite frankly I I I I offered you that I I think that the governor I are the most competitive in the end but there ought to be a at least the chair of debates that allow for everybody on the ballot to participate okay well\nWe're not going to have that ... there's been one debate you can find online if you like and as\nAs a miserable narrow said it was pretty rancor is at times we'll we'll talk about that and in fact I'm ... the governor did say during the debate that under his leadership annual state spending increases are down to two percent he called it the lowest spending increases in modern state history\nYou contended that New York state forces more cost some local governments than any state in the country so let's it isn't too is what I Want to start by asking you about his point on\nKeeping spending lower he pointed to George Pataki and said look that guy was supposed to be a fiscal conservative and here I Am as a Democrat with less in terms of annual spending increases you give them any credit for that um no\nBecause it's it's not true a annual I spending has been about four and a half percent a year it has been a now he made like to suggest that it's less than that but it's not and and the Manhattan Institute and others who monitor expenditures\nHave made perfectly clear each year spending has been as average about four and a half percent annually\nUh now that means over the course of his tenure spending has increased by about twenty five percent\nNow he likes to point to George Pataki simply because George Pataki doesn't share his party affiliation he ignores the fact\nThat the tacky comes into office after years of his father Governor Cuomo miracle of being an office where spending increases had been seismically larger so any any success or that ah that Governor Pataki was able to achieve was in context of inheriting state budgets that hadn't you know ten and twelve percent annual ... increases\nBy the time we get to to Andrew Cuomo Governor Spitzer had seen uh some some a restriction in spending Governor Paterson to the extent he could actually if you remember there was a great scene of him veto in line by line Governor Paterson expenditures he didn't think was necessary and then the governor comes into office or Andrew Cuomo a having now had\nThis curve is suspending current event but please no annual spending has increased four and a half percent it's about twenty five percent increase since he's come into office I and and that's that would be fine just be honest about it just say it but just suggest otherwise is just dishonest\nSo then on the back half of that your contention that local governments have to bear the burden more than any other state in the country if your governor what\nAre you going to do to change that well first I Want to be fair there's one state that actually has local taxpayers shut shouldering more of water traditionally state expenditures that's New Hampshire but that's because it's got an entirely\nDifferent function at the form of government and I think since we're on for a while I could be more more want to be clear about that the way you do that is for the state to start taking back some of what it mandates local governments to pay\nA for instance in this state the to the there's three areas that we focus on that are most significant and important medicate expenditures early intervention special education preschool\nAnd ... indigent legal services indigent legal services out if you are if you're without means in this country you have a constitutional right to legal defense\nWell the New York state court of appeals has said that that is a constitutional right there ought to be protected by the state of New York yet in New York we offload that expense to counties all across the state\nWhich means wherever you live you don't get the same level of representation in fact in some counties like mine\nWe've chosen to have a public defender for for somebody who who's poor regardless of the ... the court they appear and in other counties it's a it's a private attorney that maybe is working on some you know some low government hourly rate you can't guarantee the same level of response and there isn't a universal protection for those without means in the court system\nI Want New York state to pay for that because it is a constitutional right that needs to be protected Medicaid in early intervention services you know this is the this nation's Medicaid's nations uh brought us the most responsible\nProgram for helping those that are most vulnerable yet in New York we off load a those expenditures at least a twenty or ... about Seventeen percent of those expenditures to local county governments what that means is you have a massive massive progressive expenditure right this huge Medicaid budget that we forced down onto a an acute very minor very specific property tax base\nSo what the what what what the result of that is property taxes are too high because local governments are shouldering the burden and delivery that service\nI Want the state of New York to take those expenditures back for two reasons\nThe first is easy property tax relief if the state takes them back and then we used to and then we legislate statutory that you as a local community have to lower your tax levy we can lower taxes and our plan is to lower property taxes thirty percent over five years that's about a billion dollars a year it's achievable I can explain how it with great degree of boredom or detail\nBut nevertheless ah thirty percent reduction property taxes over five years\nThe second reason I Want the state responsible for those programs is because I Want to be sure they work\nI Want us to be held accountable I Want as governor to be accountable for the delivery of services for the poor delivery service for the most vulnerable delivery services for those with developmental disabilities and then use the tools to be more effective in cities like Rochester in Syracuse and in Buffalo in Albany I Want to use the tool\nTo improve the quality and condition of life for those who rely on the service\nI so I'm the first part of that when you say if if the state takes back\nShouldering that burden for all of Medicaid as what most states do nearly every state okay um that it's easy to understand why you say at that point we're going to be in position maybe cut taxes significant we're going to mandate it you're saying that our guest the next hour is the county executive uh Monroe County Cheryl ...\nMonitor with families who are dependent on it in essence establish an action plan and roadmap towards success and they want to integrate services so that is not disjointed some nutritional help is mirrored with met with mental and physical health which is matched with developmental develop a disability services which is match would snap\nAnd and and and traditional welfare services that people can can find their way to greater success that's what I Want because I Want the system if we're going to spend the billions of dollars to empower people will be the most successful in the country well I'll be blunt the\nDo you think as some critics have said this state is too generous with what if it offers under that umbrella and is it wasteful at times\nUm those are two different questions there it is wasteful at times\nI'm not willing to begin the conversation about we we have too much because I think that the services are of value I Want us to first have a conversation about making them effective and efficient in the delivery and I'll tell you this I suspect if I win this election I'm going to get one shot at getting it right so you're not going to have to worry about me being around for Twenty years right\nI figure within four years we've got to make the system as efficient and effective as possible so I don't want to even begin or end the conversation about what we spend too much we have too many programs\nWhat I Want to do is get to the heart of the programs work and if they weren't we should support them if they don't we should come up with some that do and if we don't have the capacity to prove success will then sure we shouldn't be wasting people's money\nBut I I don't think we're even there yet I Want to have a real conversation about integrating and making more effective what we do now\nMy guest is mark Miller the Republican running for governor\nOf New York state and here's the duchess county executive joining us in Studio for the hour and you can call the program if you've got a question or comment for the candidate eight four four to nine five talk that's toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five\nOr if you're in Rochester to six three W ... two six three nine nine nine for you can email us right now connections at W. X. X. I. dot org what should the state minimum wage be oh I'm I'm comfortable with its\nThat for me it's twofold I mean that's the environmental benefit ... uh and it's also putting people who work to make improvements on things that we rely on\nUh so uh so we need to do that and then to the point that I made earlier about how the state government functions\nThe state constitution requires home rule authority towns villages in cities make make land use decisions we don't have the right constitutionally as a state to steal that for them so what the state needs to do is instead of just saying hey we got this goal we need to give ... the technical support that the financial support and the\nUh uh and answer the professional support to help build comprehensive plans that includes the environment consideration\nA capital plans that ah that ah ... allows municipalities to make the appropriate infrastructure adjustments over a period of time right now we have an ruining infrastructure municipalities can't catch up and it financially our strength and community so they can meet both environmental economic needs\nDoes that mean then that you can't necessarily sit here and say under a Mona administration will see a lot more window\nBecause local municipalities might say hey we don't want that if if me or the governor the governor I sit here and tell you that we can guarantee it then we would be lying\nThe way that we we can pursue it right and the way I Would pursue it is by working with municipalities both from a land use perspective meaning we got a craft land use we've got to go through the process which includes public engagement because that's the way\nA land use gets developed so there's you know public hearings and what have you and I would actually empower a state employees to sit in the public hearings with local elected officials to answer questions\nBecause if we don't get the public's understanding or appreciation for land use change we're not going to be able to implement it and it it'll remain a a a protracted adversarial situation where none of this change happens well let me get a phone call and this is Kerry and Victor next on the phone go ahead Kerry\nHello [noise] so I have a couple of questions they actually know one one day I really thought it was very interesting [noise] uh this is what is his name again\nAnyway on our own an arrow yeah yeah yeah sorry little effect here but anyway on is take\nMedicaid I asked to get slapped special needs and it's tough it is very ... and I agree that\nYou know that's the first thing I I was wondering if he doesn't win if he would help the person if they what they are willing to listen as ideas what he'd be willing to get his ideas and help\n'em a bubbling fears of ideas I'm happy to offer them out I'll tell you first um what what you sort of a you know briefly described I recognize Israel and as I said I I you know I currently have to go through the Medicaid system\nWhat I've done in my county is in and I'd like to see us do state wide as we launched an initiative called think differently I won't go into a broad detailed ... tell you it was an effort to change the way we provide services\nOr as a community as the government for those with developmental disabilities\nI'm In my county we have a single point of contact you go to think differently dot net and you can begin to access those services and then we appointed a an ... a woman actually at a deputy commissioner who actually helps families navigate the system as governor I went to the same thing I I Won a single point of contact for all of those services\nI Want to I Want to empower staff to be ... persons in essence advocates for families to navigate and I want to integrate the delivery so that you don't have to go to multiple entities to get the same service\nSo that the long answer to your short question is there is not going to be a stronger advocate for those with developmental disabilities than me as governor of the state of New York we will lead the nation and making it better I promise you that because not only because I live at the because I Know the challenge and I know how we're leaving people behind\nNow to the question about what I Would I work with the person who wins if it's not me I had been advocating for this both politically professionally and personally with is governor for the last eight years and every time we push it every time we talk about it we get a cold shoulder\nAnd now I'm going to be I'm going to be rude for one moment not to you um but but that's why a at the Democratic convention when the governor accepted the nomination stood before the audience and said something like this and actually it was exactly like this he\nReferred to his brother is having a developmental issue now I say that because it's not a joke it's not a joke and yes I think somebody who thinks that you can just say that and not not necessarily acknowledge that it hurts people it hurts it hurts us\nUm is it's problematic over the last eight years we've seen um the the services for those with developmental disabilities become an afterthought\nAnd now with one and sixty eight diagnosed on the diagnosing the autism spectrum with so many more living a with disabilities were headed towards a community crisis we don't have transportation capacity we don't have housing opportunities whenever job opportunities we have a separate and unequal education system general versus special ed\nAnd we are leaving whole generations of people who have given support can be functional can be independent can be successful and by the way can provide the rest of us great value in benefits if only we were to better provide support\nAnd that I think is a is a failure and it's an embarrassment or that the state of New York is not good at this\nRight and one more quick question before only breaking them you've got a lot of issues in this hour is flying with the Republican candidate for governor mark Moammar OSU wants to know\nA does a reduction of property taxes unfairly leave out many ranchers\nUm only if we don't require the savings to be passed on to ranchers and now there's not an easy way to do it outside of the city of New York city New York has rent stabilization see can almost mandate\nThat rents go down with with with a tax levy reduction but we would provide the ability of renters to benefit from that either through a write off on your on your income tax or requiring landlords to uh to be able to transfer that benefit in some sort of credit or something of that nature but I promise you there's\nRenters deserve the relief if the landowner is getting the property tax relief and we will create a statutory mechanism in a legal mechanism to make that happen\nOn line where's your website mark ah Oh thank you moment arrow for N.

hit a subject that a ... some of our listeners multiple listeners on Twitter in by email a vast and so I'm kind of summarize they asked about\nAn exchange you had one of the many contentious exchanges you had with Governor Cuomo in your only debate which happened earlier this week and that was on the subject of roe v Wade now about four years ago Rob asked to Reno on this program\nSaid I don't know anybody asked about abortion in this state my opinion doesn't matter it's settled law the land and it's you know this country has never going to walk back abortion\nWell here we are and there's good reason to think that at the very least if roe gets overturn and now could\nThen it goes back to the states overnight twenty states could decide no abortion or New York is not one of those states but that doesn't mean that abortion would be exactly the same as a federal complication and I think that's the concern people laugh and I think that was the point that Governor Cuomo was making that\nRoe is not necessarily the law the land in New York state and you it's not always apples to apples and protecting it matters you are arguing that it's the lotto and it's sort of a non issue so walk me through I I I don't speak freebies on I think it's a non issue\nI it's not for me I I I recognize that it is it first of all for people who truly are passionate it's an it's an issue regardless right so I don't want I don't dismiss that\nUm I I Believe first of all I I don't believe the ... the Supreme Court is going to overturn roe but but that said I understand why why some listening could and and I understand that I get it I understand politics certainly\nUm my concern is that I don't embrace or the governor's a advancement of a of a of a\nAbortion legislation the way he's presented it which is for me if there's a need if roe were overturned for the state and it and from my perspective it will begin in the state legislature please understand that the state assembly is going to move that forward if you believe the Senate is going to flip and not be a Republican majority will move forward\nBut my perspective is I Need to be able to speak on behalf of people who don't embrace\nAbortion but also those who don't believe there is consensus or legal or the proper legal consideration for late term abortion and and I knowledge that that there are those who who who think I'm you know you know a bit you know I guess a more and more stringent and that but there are there is not a consensus around late term abortions\n... there's close to a consensus if you ask Gallup Gallup says sixty percent of Americans favor first term abortion options Thirteen percent of Americans favor third term abortions here right now in this country eighty seven percent of Americans according to Gallup do not\nIn New York state senator rich funky last week said this about gender piece of legislation he says I Believe that what you are an atomic ally is the bathroom you should use until you're not and that's the problem I have with this bill do you agree or disagree with ...\nI Believe there's I I say this I think there's a difference between genders\nAnd in gender identity gender identity is the the active of moving of changing gender to to what you you know what you hoping that since the ... comic to be\nUm I think there needs to be healthy respect for that I Do um so I just would offer it to you that I'm a while I Want to protect the civil rights of of individuals ah regardless of expression or identity I Want to be cognizant of the fact that I'm\nA wholesale I Want to ... to the fact that the bill does this bill as I as I remember it being in the state assembly doesn't adequately provide those protections okay to the back to the phones and Steve in the town of Greece go ahead Steve\nYeah Hi um my question is regarding a couple of tax issues ah very frustrating for me the first one is the salt limitation at ten thousand and uh the second is the elimination of\nNew York New York state tax says the ducks and other federal income tax just a curious what your position on that\nIs I think Steve ... is what I was trying to offer the other night and I did I I opposed and still oppose uh those provisions in particular the salt deduction kept\nA the salt detection dates back to the civil war for a lot of good reasons\nThat that said um you know I I I Believe that it was a necessary for the federal government to to capture the salt induction I've said it\nI Will continue to advocate uh for uh the the salt deduction to be reestablished in its entirety I sunsets in twenty twenty two twenty Twenty one something of that nature probably after the presidential election [laughter]\nUh so that'll give us the opportunity to fight uh to to have it reestablish now the two things that Africa was number one if you want to solve the auction fully reestablished high tax states have to take responsibility to\nAnd so the problem in New York isn't that we have had the deduction it's that we have too many we have ... too high tax and I believe if you want to get Congress to move if you want them to pay attention and no matter by the way who's responsible for Congress I'll tell you right now nobody wants to have to pay the bill [laughter] whether it's whether no matter which party is in charge\nA so my position is very simple get our house in order and use that as a sign of leadership delivered a ... reached out which one of the salt deduction that is necessary and by providing property tax relief that's one step the other thing in my tax plan that we do ah that that will be helpful to folks in the interim\nI is addressed what's called bracket creep in New York state if you make a dollar more than a particular tax bracket we tax you a hundred percent at that tax bracket\nI suggest that if you make a dollar more at above a tax bracket we only catch the dollar at that tax bracket and then everything else has the lower rate would that would mean for middle class families is is about a thousand dollars worth of savings\nEach year mirror that with a thirty percent reduction in property taxes over five years\nWill start to mitigate real relief but also mitigate the impact of salt the Dutch and also puts us in a\nI think a a higher position a stronger position to argue with Congress that we've we've done our job now it's important for you to yours and allow the salt the option to be reestablished I'd just over a minute left Adam rights to the program and says this Democrat thinks that the Republican on your show sounds pretty reasonable but please tell me he's a never Trump republic I'll listen I\nI I'm I I tell my kids there's nothing is never always and I hope I didn't just turn you off but my position is very simple\nI Will always I always speak up if I Believe that the federal government or this president says or does something that's not in the best interest of New Yorkers I have I did after Charlottesville given unsolved exemption I stood up against Medicaid in and and block grant reductions I Will do that\nAnd then when I Need the federal government to pay attention to invest in inner cities to invest in in housing to invest in infrastructure I'm going to do that too but I Will tell listeners this\nThis governor will never be able to to even even politically or engage with the federal government moving forward he can't he can't he can't possibly because he'll he'll diminished his his his his ... political standing\nI just would say very very clearly I Will always throw balls and strikes I did I Will I you you likely no I didn't vote for the president\nUm I didn't vote for Trump I did and I had some personal reasons why I didn't I've made that clear but I Am always going to hope for the best work towards the best and stand up and support a when I think it's in the best interest in New York and I will fight when I think it isn't\nOne more time and the website if

tell you\nUh we've we've talked to many businesses who are ultimately will come here for a very friday of reasons that we'll talk about but the first thing that businesses say is oh my gosh you're from New York state that's that state that taxes too much debt that state that has\nA unfair burden on businesses asset state that every time I Want to do something I have to jump through a hundred hoops just to create jobs so\nIn that environment is that as a background um for better or worse a tax incentives are offered or um some other a way to incentivize businesses to either located here span here and grow here I Wish I didn't have to be the case\nGame you have feel like you have to play with [noise] unfortunately yes and uh you know when we look at the city gate a project I\nAs I said before I was not here when that ah that development came into being but I Know that it was one that was certainly um supported by the city of Rochester and I can certainly understand why and uh it appears to be very complicated with the dynamics of what's happening with the corporation and also what's happening in their family\nWhen I asked you to let our listeners know about project fair or initiatives they make here about here and there but may not know about and I want to start with letters up if we could sure tell me about ...\n[noise] so I Love I Love letters up I'm actually letters up with something that we created a year a year ago\nI had to really help with our workforce development efforts and so the reason we started out was in visiting with businesses throughout Monroe County um besides talking about taxes and regulations and unfair burns that the state places on them\nOne of their biggest concerns was getting a people to come and work at jobs that we currently have in this community you know when we talk about um what's happening in Monroe County I really pains me to know that there are so many jobs available and we're talking about good paying career paths for folks who are here in this community\nAnd so letters up was an idea to really bring together a the needs of businesses here in this community and work with people who are in our community to bring those two together so help people uh get into the job market\nAnd certainly help our businesses floor so what we've done is we've partnered certainly with I'm CC which has you know the community funds on they do a wonderful job with their workforce development but\nWe actually reach out to businesses say okay what kind of training what kind of employees do you need work with ... seats for a pair of those courses for businesses um\nTo help them be successful and then we go out and recruit people to fill those businesses so when you go into a training program or through a letters up\nWe I help you being the skills necessary at the end of the training you have a job with companies that we've partnered with so a good example would that would be an admiral corporation which is a local company here in Rochester I'm they expanded in two thousand Eighteen doubled their footprint here in the in the city of Rochester\nWe provided the training for the folks that they needed and they employ thirty people\nSo that's been really a a great success I'm just this year we trained over two hundred recruits who've come through the training program and had been working\nOn them and feels and feels like metal fabrication\nUm project management welding careers customer service and more so it really is about identifying folks who have not been in the job market I'm bringing them into employment and helping our local employers fulfilled a needs that they have so they can continue to do business here in the county up in a row\nAnd there's a website that uh ... dot edu slash ladders up and Z instead of us on ladders letters ... will lick that if you want to check it out and learn more about it and the reason I wanted to kind of get to it at our earliest because\nWe had a recent conversation with Bob Duffy recent conversation with the folks from Rochester works and what they paint as a picture in talking to reporters is exactly what you just said which is that you talk to employers who say\nBut believe it or not we have positions that we are struggling to fill which goes against the narrative that I Know the unemployment rate that raw numbers down um but you know there's always a question of who's not looking or um you know if people are working are they able to match\nPrevious salaries are wages if they had lost jobs ten years ago five years ago and so this idea that there's these great big jobs that they can't fill runs a little bit against what\nWe hear about an economy that is growing but still struggling in some ways but you're saying yes that\nIs true and just yesterday we had our career construction day out at our fleet center in a in a ... road and we brought in over eight hundred local high school students and they had the opposite\nUnity to have a hands on experience with are skilled trades a union so we had a lecture ... carpenters masons you Tracy welders all gather together\nAnd what's interesting about that as each one of the skilled trades his having the same situation of we need to bring people into a these good career path\nSo this year actually last year we started I'm doing something a little different and I was telling the guys look you know what we need to really tell people how great this career path is creative arts collaborative um it's innovative\nSo besides letting people have the kids are young people have the opportunity to try it why don't we hand out a cart telling them how much the starting pay is in these career paths\nAnd we did that and it was astonishing to our young people that are high school graduate can go into a one of our our trades groups\nAnd have a starting income of forty five fifty thousand dollars a year a little experience you're talking about income up to a hundred thousand dollars you could be a you know certainly have a a very fulfilling career one that will sustain you and your families for years to come\nAnd then on top of that yesterday and was talking to the students I said go home with these cards\nAnd go show your parents or what you can do with a high school graduate degree and entering into this career path in addition to that there is additional opportunities to go on for higher education it I'm CC or four year degree and beyond that in those in those same a skilled trades\nAnd we need to make sure that we're emphasizing with our students with our parents with our schools that\nYou know certainly a college is a wonderful opportunity for folks who want people to uh certainly pursue a college degree as well but it is not for everyone and there are skilled trains that are available those jobs are always looking to hire a well qualified people here in the community\nYou have to sold out chose the little theaters night for dialogue and metal which is W. exercise documentary about the ... right here in our community and Jesse James Jesse James will be here tonight you can't come out to the little theatre and figure to get into that so that but I Will I'm a moderate tonight and Jesse James is passionate about this she says you know people\nI'm to the extent that we're not turning students kids on to the idea of welding careers of metal fabrication of all these things that are really accessible um he's very passionate about that and so I'm looking at mc sees economic and workforce development center I'm looking at\nPrecision tooling certificate there's different options for training that are happening sounds like that's been a priority for use\nWell absolutely you know I'm I'm a person of of action oven and so when I go out and I talked to businesses and they say we need workers\nUm I say OK what can we do to help you and we're going to put this together we're not going to just talk about it I mean talk is great we all know what the situation is but we have to take action and that type programs like letters op are so successful we have companies knocking on her door every day saying how do we get involved in this we want to be part of it because it's proven success that\nAre certainly a win win for businesses that I Want to continue here but you know equally important actually more importantly is that we're keeping people in the county Monroe employed and that's\nAnd that's terrific you know there's nothing like a job or\nIt helps it helps you help your family or role model for your kids\nSo we're going to do all that we can do um you know not to not to go on with us but I also want to talk about another a group that we've been working with and we know it has a funny name it's called the plastics consortium so you might want to know what the heck as a plastics consortium right when we first started I said we should probably come up with a different name but\nUm these her group of nine companies here in Rochester who do for example plastic mold injection would be a good example\nAnd they need employees as well so we gather together and working again with I'm CC we've now put through two classes\nAnd uh I was never I was never I'm afraid that we weren't able to handle the work I knew we could do that\nI always like these two projects I think that they bring great benefit to this community\nUm but the one pause that I had is that's a lot of jobs that a lot of skilled labor but are skilled labor industry or trade unions all of our contractors they've really stepped up to the plate and they're working day and night so my hats are up to them their project will be wrapped up by the end of October\nSo let me restore credibility that it'll turn to David read his column saying we shouldn't call ourselves international airport in more of a cat it a flight you feel about that [laughter]\nWell um I I Love reading Dave columns I think that he's one of the most talented writers and all of mineral counties I Hope I didn't offend anybody else who's writing\nBy his journalistic style is uh is very strong um but I Will tell you I've read I read the article and had a little chuckle so Dave I Hope you're listening I'm you know certainly uh with the the flight from Canada we were looking at about nine passengers a day on that flight\nI'm an international aspect of the airport goes far beyond the nine customers who are flying in and out of Toronto um it goes well beyond that you know certainly a we have um our our federal agents who are there\nAre at the airport everyday the airport is certainly a conduit for trade as well so the international designation goes far beyond a that one flight\nUm we're seeing robots activity out of the airport um are\nA number of seats sold a year to date from last year to this year we've seen over fifty thousand additional seat so that's tremendous expanded our service with a Jet Blue certainly nonstop service to Boston um the direct flights a that selfless is offering to Florida has been you know really terrific\nOf the airport is a great economic driver for us uh here in the county up and grow and the enhancement send the upgrades at the airport really speaks volumes about what is happening here in Monroe County\nSo we're seeing a certainly a lot of upgrades and some are very noticeable summer not us on behind the scenes a total of revamping of our HVAC someone folks around the airport at the temperature will be appropriate that was a very old an antiquated system\nWe're helping out a A R a hearing impaired population here not only in the county ran wrote me a very large population here but those who are visiting us as well with a state of the art technology so that we can communicate better\nI'm certainly the opportunities to have better ah eating dining options we've listened to our customers about that we're opening up business center so that\nBusinesses can land here at the airport have a a meeting if they want to ah meet with us some clients here they can do that without having to actually leave the airport both on the security side of the airport and the ... side of the airport\nOr saving their technology for security will be first of its kind in the nation you know we'll be unveiling that next week\nI'm the opportunity to partner with a strong museum which is a really innovative ah aspect of that project us so that when people are coming in to Rochester before they even leave the airport they can know about some of the benefits of being here so we've got the strong museum partnership on both concourses for her um\nInteractive video games that children's play area opportunities to have a taste of Rochester at the airport again I'd tasting food from throughout Monroe County so that before you leave the airport you know some about\nOf the vitality of Monroe County so it's a great project and my hats are off to a the numerous thunders and all of the dedicated men and women who have been on that job day and night and I will tell you that uh I was there two nights ago and um they're working till midnight every night to get the job done so heads off to them\nOr here's an email from Bridget Hurley from the children's agenda she says how is hiring in child protective services progressing it was part of the county executive two dozen Seventeen reform plan and what does the current average caseload for CPS workers\nHi Bridget how are you as an email right I'm very well she was on the line so [laughter] so Bridget a is a is a great advocate and uh certainly a a good partner as well so I Want to thank her um she she a ... meetings every month\nAnd uh certainly uh we've had enjoyed a good relationship or to make sure that we're doing all that we can to protect children and families are here in the county up and throw 'em\n... as you know a bridge it knows I Want to make sure that your listeners know as well\nWith respect to a child protective agency or we've taken a number of stops a to a increase the number of people that were hiring in our budget last year thirty more positions were funded\nFor CPS we also um raised the salary schedule for our employees there which was a much needed\nThe men and women who are working in that department are incredibly dedicated incredibly hard working under some of the most challenging of times in situations with our families here in the community so I Want to thank them\nFor their dedication to our families and our children in the county up and row\nWe've also worked with a ongoing training to help retain employees are in our energy\nAreas and we've been able to do just that\nWe've been using some modern technology you know certainly uh to make sure that we have the technology to support our employees so that their time is not spent filling out paperwork ... you know are tending to the needs of our our our kids and our families as well mentoring programs a recruiting programs\nAnd what that has a what that has resulted in for us as that overall\nAnd we've seen a Nineteen percent decrease in the overall number of open investigations you're in this community are caseload size has been reduced by about Fifteen Percent\nUh since we started on this uh this plan and are processing times down as well so we're happy about that that's certainly a a provides great benefits to our families\nBut we've also achieved a Seventy five percent retention rate\n'em up people that we have hired over the last year so Seventy five percent of the hardworking men and women who have applied for a position had been hired by the county are staying with us and that provides for us stability that provides a certainly a for a better outcome for our families here in this community\nAre affected bridge and my guess is Sheldon also Monroe County executive I'm On the subject of kids you probably saw back to our friends of the Democratic chronicled his editorial they wrote a piece of about a week ago just a few days ago said it's time to declare an emergency in schools and I wonder if you feel like you do have a place and just because they look to name they wrote\nQuote we called our state lawmakers ... county executive Sheryl ... and Merrill lovely warrant to declare a state of emergency they must be getting much more important process than choosing a new superintendent they must begin to change the system and quote\nYou agree with them and it is your place or\nSo you know what ... education is foundational and you know when I look at what is happening uh with our education system and some of the outcomes that we're seeing it's a crying shame and uh when I look at it I think one of the past two\nOr having a better outcome with our education system is really strengthening our families\nAnd one of the things that are we are of obviously already talked about but when we look at family structure and we look at people um who are in a position to support their families what I had been doing since day one is county executive is reaching into our department of of Human Services\nConnecting with families I'm taking a the opportunity to work with families to help them be successful because we know that in a family unit when there's some structure ah for folks were able to go to work each day to get up and go to work bringing their kids to school\nUm come home at the end of the day bring that child home um and go on and do that and do that day after day after day and be engaged we have better outcomes for\nOur kids and our families going to school is so incredibly important and so is that structure of having a place to go each day so we're investing in our families ought to give them the best opportunities for success\nAnd certainly a the educational process um is one that we ... we need to pay attention to\nWrite a let me also ask you just give our listeners a brief up to them the county's opioid action plan I mean I could be its own

plan which you may or may not be aware of and your listeners might be interested in knowing that each month we gather at my office and this is at my request\nA and sheriff Todd Baxter or I might
