United states and Mexico President Trump is delivering details from the White House Rose Garden\nMy great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nGold us embassy a sort of just work family [noise]\nTrade officials for both countries say they're renegotiated deal will result in free markets and fair trade the two countries also agreed to protect Canada from any future auto tariffs imposed by the U.S the agreement was reached after weeks of bitter high pressure negotiations\nThat brushed up against a mid night deadline [noise] the U.S Supreme Court is back in session today NPR's Nina Totenberg reports that the new term is beginning regardless of the chaos of the Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nThere'll be eight justices sitting on the bench the situation that is not ideal but not unfamiliar\nWhen conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died in early twenties sixteen Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell kept a vacancy open for almost a year locking President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court Merrick Garland\nNow with Trump nominee Brett Kavanaugh mired in controversy the court is once again soldier going on with only eight justices the difference is that in twenty sixteen conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy who sometimes voted with the liberal members of the court on key questions has retired\nAnd the court is now evenly split between conservatives and liberals Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington\nThey like to be told to figure out how to do something they don't like to be told to do something and not know why so I think that it's this this underlying assumption that capitalism is associated with these workplace cultures\nAnd I think that's part of part of what it's driving um I think and I I Me personally I grew up working for my own family business in India and this is all I Know you know it's a private equity how it supports the economy and we're seeing that in ... in Rochester as well and many other states that I've lived in\nAnd worked in before a ... a quote that I saw on MSNBC this comes from a list of course who is the executive director of the economic hardship reporting project\nShe told CNBC that wages are not keeping up as day to day costs continue to rise and she told them quote start blaming the system or start blaming the deeper causes of your economic fragility and instability there are forces that are constructed against you everything from your taxes to whether you can have job security at all and quote\nToo extreme or you think that's a fair critique\nWell uh I think there's some substance to it but there are many other factors that are involved in in creating that opinion\nToday we see I mean I don't want to get into details of that but like the tax policies the tax changes and how they actually impact trade with other countries and trade deficit unemployment rates\nA and a variety of those things come together to it it's not just one thing you know it's like it's not it's not like OK get ready to get ready to face the future and it's going to be horrible but\nBut it's a variety of policies and I'm at tax implications and and international trade that you know that is impacting impacting us any more complex issue Avon and I mean we can talk about that those aspects\nOf in detail but um there is some substance to it because that is the perception or in that coat that things are going to be bad\nAnd ah but here's the deal you know we millennials don't think about we have companies that are monopolies like Netflix right like Google we still continue to use them and has a Bush in ... which which is a international\nMonopoly in the in the beverage beer industry so it's not a problem too much economic house in ... well it is and that's why we have this a laissez faire type of policies where we limit the monopolies in industries and we're watching them and their regulations to to to regulate regulations to\nDo not have too much of that but yet in certain industries we have them and they are creeping up\nWithout people paying close attention to it\n[noise] yeah I Would say um you know there's a real debate about whether we've done much to limit monopoly at all or at least not in a way that the Brandeis very used to do I'm so\nAll right so ... let me turn to Alan Ziegler who is with the Rochester area business ethics foundation and I will just say they've got their annual ... coming up to the ethical business awards I'm always proud to MC that event\nBecause I don't know many organizations that really are as\nTrue blue devoted to uh cause like Alan and this group that ... is\nThe criticism I hear from friends uh who who have these doubts say that your fighting sort of losing cause because capitalism itself the\nThe ... it's designed to reward winners and create losers and this is always going to be the case and I wonder if you find that too cynical or if you think again that critique has got some ...\n[noise] I Would end up on the cynical side um you know I one of the things we've done was rape is is to not have winners because with winners you have losers but rather we have recipients\nTo try and get away with that but in candor it hasn't worked or those who received the award call themselves winners and I know that some of those who don't leave the room thinking of some kind of a loser\nSo [laughter] I don't know why because you can inject socialism into a system that rewards capitalism Allen\n[laughter] um but I think the uh I think the big issue is the fact that I don't think either of those terms or well understood okay by the millennial generation somebody said you know capitalism has a marketing problem\nAnd sort of socialism because most people think well if the government does something the more socialist but socialism is a way bigger concept than just the government taking over driver's licenses or something\nSo I think there's just a lack of understanding but I think what there is is there's a huge amount of frustration this younger generation least college with large loans\nI'm forty percent of kids who start college after six years haven't graduated\nThose kids have spent tons of money their families have spent money and they're bereft they don't have a job\nThey don't have much of a future there probably never going back to college\nSo it's that it's that look of of sort of desperation of not seeing anything positive in the future and so they lash out to the system and the system has some problems\nThe income separation is a horrible problem and I I'm a huge fan of conscious capitalism in the work of Andrew's doing because what it's doing is saying\nIf if the capitalistic economy would take responsibility for doing some of the things and not being so greedy using some of that money for the public good we wouldn't have these discussions about socialism or the government creeping into what could be the solution of these endemic problem\nThis is why I wanted this panel here this hour because they're not here to stay capitalism is perfect for her to say that the system is the best possible system that we can have and there are legitimate problems right now is people see them and there's ways forward now Andrew on the conscious capitalism side\nA lot of the critics of conscious capitalism or not critics of your desire to see businesses do good for the world per se\nThey would argue that it's akin to saying to football players look we're not going to have referees what we want you to do those protect the quarterback and guys you don't have the head\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comes from our members\nAnd from ... a small batch ... brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what growl are available to go on line at cat ... dot com\nSee that there's a there's a level of of authenticity right you can't just put out a marketing message I and expect that to be that the narrative your of your organization because equally if not more important is what people are saying and what people are experiencing\nSo just yes here and this is totally unfair but I'm going to ask is or what percentage of American companies do you think are behaving in a way that you would say is in line with conscious capitalism values you know what\nI think um it it's it's hard to put a percentage on so let me let me sidestep you're very difficult unfair classes and I and and it said say that you know I think that ... for example a conscious capitalism started from a book called firms of endearment that looked at what was it that set companies apart\nOr that they were you know the the goals and they you know ... was was mentioned in the book and and they talked about they had a higher purpose beyond making profits\nOr they had a stakeholder orientation that balance the needs of the customers that community the employees the environment you know in addition to the stock holders\nYeah it it comes down to what what Adam Smith said about the invisible hand right that that when people are acting in the end their self interest\nOr they are creating that level of of dynamism where where people are are trying any you know entrepreneurs are are given at a going there there may be succeeding and maybe they're failing but\nThen they they they do it again and so when when you have a you know this this invisible hand versus as as a Allen is mentioning kind of the central plan it's just just like in a company on a company puts together there's three years strategic plan\nIt takes what about about a month until the industry changes or something on for scene happens you can only predicts so much and so when you\nWhen you have central planning or or some element like that um you you can't foresee everything that's going to happen to you Mike Tyson you know so that everybody's got a plan and so you get punched in the face so you know you gotta you gotta great plan but but when you have capitalism it's somewhere so much more dynamic\nI it's it's so much more more flexible and and adaptable and and that's really what what creates you know being able to listen to the market being able to test things out being able to try and fail a and and sometimes succeed that's what creates capitalism that that can respond to really the market needs and and create\nSo much of the the technology that that we enjoy today\nI I before I turn to Dr Yorker for that I Would just follow up by saying or ... months ago pointed to Denmark which is almost always on the top ten sometimes top five list of\nIndicators for innovation despite a lot of state ownership does that impact our consideration for dynamism innovation et cetera\nWell first I'd say that um I don't I don't think that moving moving in that direction in uh in in some ways in in terms of some of the Scandinavian countries in the things that they do\nUm wouldn't be wouldn't be positive on on a number of levels but I'd also say that their their system as much as they call it socialist or or or or not a full social assist it's they they really operate on a lot of on a lot of capitalist principles I in the way that they in the way that they run it and so\nUm you know they they've found what seems to be a nice happy medium\nUm between between ... you know a central planned system whatever you want to call that whether it's\nSocialism communism or whatever you want to call it and and and the capitalist system they've found a a balance and I think that uh you know we need to find a better balance as well in terms of the the er the dynamism of capitalism with that kind of\nA socialist or or or maybe not socialist you know just because of the the weight that comes with that term but the the caring for for everyone in the country and caring for having more quality and and those elements that that is a great\nSocial consciousness you got it Dr younger\nYeah I think um our students don't realize that we graduate them and they are contributing to this capitalist economy\nThey get employed with private equity firms mostly uh not to say that they are not you know going to public forums but uh they have they they have an opportunity to shape capitalism that's that's what I think we need to remind them\nAnd they're not fully aware that let's say what will happen to them in a socialist economy or what if everything becomes state controlled will they had the choices that they have\nSo you can't have vote right so we can do the right thing with capitalism you know the uh Allen talked about and Andrew talked about companies are now are putting out sustainability to ports and corporate social responsibility to ports\nOf as part of their regular annual reporting process so there are things happening smaller and smaller medium size businesses are doing that stuff but they don't have the resources to\nActually publicized and do that but I think that that it's partly a lack of awareness and if our students are saying\nThat you know capitalism is bad for them I don't think that recognizing that definitely participating in capitalism and they have an opportunity to really shape it our elderly whatever I just want to commend Dr\nYoke or for your position with teaching students how to interview that they can have an impact because that's exactly how they have an impact on capitalism\n[noise] we have a lot of phone calls to work through and feedback as well so we're gonna get to that after our only break in the hour we're talking to our guests about their thoughts on recent surveys from Gallup indicating that a majority of young Americans Eighteen Eighteen to twenty nine American adults\nA have a a more positive view of socialism than capitalism and more suspicious of capitalism for the first time in\nIn many decades if not ever since they've been doing this kind of survey work and you just heard Dr ... who is dean and professor of marketing at the school of business at St John Fisher College Andrew Brady you as a board member for rape after Rochester area business ethics foundation CEO of the accelerate team\nFounder and co chair of the local chapter of conscious capitalism\nAnd Allen Ziegler from ray Beth as well before the hours out by the way they're going to tell you where they they think you ought to be checking out more on whether it's a firms have been ... were to learn more about conscious capitalism how to nominate a company for an ethical business award et cetera lots to tell you about but let's get to your phone calls your critique send your support of capitalism next\nComing up in our second hour Canada is getting ready to legalize marijuana across the country what does that mean for the United states

connection to ... studio audience so to speak with your phone calls Bob in Penn field first go ahead Bob\nEvans thanks a lot shorter saw I'm thinking that uh today's universities and colleges are nothing but global a socialist you know indoctrination centers is all\nAre bending the minds of the wrong way we've got young people today are generation who can't even mode daddy's yard they have to pay somebody in the yard 'cause Eighteen year old junior he can do it okay\nOr the situation is why should I be able to get up go to work figure it out smarter than my competition and there'll be penalize to carry the dead weight and I'll take it even further and socialism in liberalism is great until you run out of\nWhere people's money financing for you and I'll even take a step further if I could vote tomorrow to end the welfare system in this country I Would do it sink or swim so there'd be no social support it all you think\nNo no no because the nations that that we are at that threshold right now where we can't do it it's been drained dry\nNon zero sink or swim hey let me tell you something my wife's parents\nCame over to this country in Nineteen fifty seven she was pregnant with twins they got dumped Ellis Island and said good luck [laughter] good luck\nThere you go yeah and and they made it under a capitalistic ideas he went to work he got smart he made a better product and the other guys and that may have you ever seen a lion move over at the kill for this stupid line can't kill the zebra doesn't happen\nAll right I'm going to lions when I I'm hearing about I've got to play thank you for the phone call I think let me go around the table and just ask I guess what they think you Andrew ready\nYet you what what immediately comes to mind as we're talking about the Scandinavian countries right in some of the social safety net that that they have\nA you know think about what you would do as an individual in in America if you if you feel like you don't have any kind of safety net would you be willing to take a big risk to be an entrepreneur\nUm you know or if you do have some level of of of a safety net or or some way that you know that at least your basics we'll we'll be taking care of our people will be there to help you help you you'd be more likely to take a risk and and it could lead to actually us becoming even more dynamic and and other things that I've seen you know\nI think that when you think about taking away some of those\nWhatever I mean he's talking about a it was Bob ... talking about getting rid of of welfare programs or things like that\nUm I ... the chamber to their credit\nHad a had an a breakfast that I went to last year around there when they talked about the investments in early childhood education\nAnd the the that it's perhaps one of the best are why activities you could possibly have does it costs money in the short term yes absolutely but then in terms of the the a level of of impact that it has for for people that are able to contribute to society\nYou know I I think that are in some cases we we do need to force the issue a little bit you know capitalism does\nCreate inequalities we're talking about some of the the monopoly is you know that that happened and sometimes that's just because it feeds on itself right like\nGoogle becomes the best Internet search engine then it becomes even a larger and larger and larger slice of the pie and so you do need to uh you know restrain that and make sure that other uh other competitors have a chance to come in today Dr younger\nAnd I agree I think the systems need to be managed otherwise you know as Andrew said if it gets out of control then it becomes one extreme or the other\nAnd the disparity you know a continues to increase\nAnd not that poverty doesn't exist in socialistic societies it ... you know and I've traveled in all kinds of Scandinavian countries everybody in Sweden is average but you still see certain sectors and pockets where poverty exist exactly like it exist and capitalistic society so\nUm so I think that it's a and I'm On the same page with Andrew that we need to manage it well and if things get out of control we need to have systems in place that bring it back\nTo ... in a systemic way that that that is a minimum level of a lifestyle that everybody has okay Allen\nJust quickly I think ah there's a real danger if we try to use broad brush is to describe these issues were not you know the Bob's who say anything socialistic is wrong and the capitalist who say everything capitalistic is right that's just not true is to the point you're making of managing systems\nUm when you talk about poverty can be totally eradicated sadly probably not but I Do think of the fact that when I and I will plead guilty to this occasionally go to McDonald's for a quarter Potter with cheese\nI realize that the price is right for me because the guy serving it to me is being underpaid and I asked myself do I feel good about that I feel good about him helping pay for my Hamburg that's the kind of thing that can be corrected\nOr Peter and Penn Yan says I'm sick people can't work therefore universal healthcare can make capitalism more productive Bismarck knew this Nineteen in Eighteen eighty three why is that such a hard sell here\nCan you have capitalism and universal healthcare absolutely okay Andrew absolutely Yeah Dr Yorker capitalism universal healthcare\nWell it's it's it's a complicated question but um it's possible okay [laughter] probably a whole other our ah John ... says hey Evan for those who believe Scandinavian nation are actually capitalistic I Would be more\nThan happy for us to switch to a Scandinavian style of capitalism I suspect John as our political campaigns continue\nThis year and in twenty twenty you'll hear more\nAbout that um got to keep it really tight here I'm as we get ready to death that are less Ninety seconds and I just want our guest is to let you know where you think maybe you can\nThink about kind of continue to expand your thoughts on these subjects conscious capitalism of the book that you that sparked it was called what was it called firms\nOf endearment highly recommended written by a ... and then in addition we have a local chapter of conscious capitalism where\nEvery month we either go to our local business

D. to Rochester and W. tonight he HGH Webster\nFrom WXXI ... news I met in ...\nMight have missed it but marijuana is going to be legal recreationally in Canada [noise] just about two weeks Canada makes candidates legal across the country what does that mean for the United states while in many ways mean nothing or laws change of course\nBut there are a lot of questions about what it put me at the border what about American to go to Canada use marijuana I Want to come home [noise] what about Canadians were visiting Rochester western New York or other parts of the United states [noise]\nWhat about those working in the legal cannabis industry here or in Canada here of course it's but this one in most places\nA lot of questions about how legalization of marijuana impact will discuss coming up I was going to [noise]\n\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is answering reporters' questions from the White House Rose Garden after announcing that the U.S and Canada have reached a new trade deal the U.S Mexico Canada agreements replaces the north American free trade agreement\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nTrump says he and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts plan to sign it by the end of November it would then be submitted to Congress for approval early next year\nThe president has also been fielding questions about sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd while the president is telling reporters today that he wants the FBI to do a wide ranging and comprehensive investigation NPR's Windsor Johnston reports new questions are emerging about how the probe is actually being conducted\nSome democratic lawmakers are accusing the White House of trying to micromanage and limit the scope of the investigation Delaware Senator Chris Coons tells NPR the probe should be broader\nIt's got to have opportunities for the FBI to follow up on things that were obviously before us documents for example like the calendar the judge Kavanaugh put forward I Would expect the FBI would be able to then go interview people who appeared on that counter\nThe White House says the FBI has full rein to investigate whatever it wants Senate Republicans had given the agency a week to review the allegations before moving ahead with a full vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation winter Johnson NPR News Washington\n... to ... if you're in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for Germany before we kind of get into some of those granular question step by step on what this does mean\nI'm curious to know if you think that this is a harbinger of anything when it comes to public opinion the way population's view marijuana usage medicinal and recreational and if you think that this moves the United states any closer to legalization\nYou're talking about the the ... the Canadian movement yeah yeah I mean I again it's\nJust another headline another country that's fully legalizing and I wonder if you think it has any impact here\nI I think it does I think both from a from a a [noise] from just the perspective of seeing um headlines coming out of our neighbor to the north legalizing cannabis I think that\nDoes ah that that does a lot to um enduring our population to uh the possibilities of legalization but more importantly what I think it does particularly\nFor the business community and and the economic development stakeholders in our in our in our country whether they're private actors like myself are government actors are or what have you is what's happening is there's a tremendous amount of economic opportunity that's being lost to to Canada\nUm there are there are companies in the United states medical cannabis companies and and uh don't use cannabis companies that are getting bigger and more robust they're turning into real live multi state companies and the fact that there is this in the United states federal um\nIllegality in clarity this tension between you know thirty some odd states that want either a medical or do that do use program and the federal government that hasn't really caught up to that yet I'm it's making it hard for us to compete with the Canadians remember\nCandidate as a country with some thirty five million people so wall these Canadian medical an adult use marijuana companies are getting bigger and real bussed in building out their facilities and building out their their teams and and and in investing in in this the development of this industry\nWe're we're still crippled by this tension between the states and um and the federal government and so I I think it has a ... at\nThe Canadian announcements have a positive impact in in getting people to understand that if we're going to be competitive in this brand new emerging market um that we need to we need to do something at the federal level here in the United states\nYou know I'm gonna turn to Danielle with the questions on the lack of clarity and just a moment let me go ahead and read from the government of Canada laying out on their own website how the new Canadian law works um upon coming into force adults in Canada will be legally allowed to purchase fresh or dried Canada's Canada's oil plants and seeds for cultivation\nFrom either a PR eventually or territory regulated retailer or where this option is not available directly from a federally licensed producer\nThey will be allowed to possess up to thirty grams of dried legal cannabis or its equivalent in public they will be allowed to share up to thirty grams or its equivalent of legal cannabis and legal cannabis products with other adults\nThey will be allowed to cultivate up to four plants at home for plants total per household and allowed to prepare varying types of cannabis products such as edibles at home for personal use provided that no dangerous organic solvent are used in the process so that's what's coming in Canada\nOn October seventeenth and I think a good place to start with questions for\nDaniel ... comes from an email from Justin who is presumably not Justin Trudeau but just because he says as an American citizen I'm Wondering what this means for anyone who goes to Canada or takes in marijuana then returns home when we get searched at the border will we get drug tested at the border\nSo us citizens who are returning home from Canada I cannot be refused entry to the United states um you have a right to return to your home country\nHowever ... which is a concern for Canadian citizens but for us citizens if you are carrying any marijuana on your person or in your vehicle\nThat can be searched and see used um there are still criminal law I'm consequences to that uh if you are found to be in possession of marijuana at the border they will call the police um and so you can still be arrested for that because it is against the law [noise]\nUm so so those are concerns um are they going to ask every single person coming across the border if they took in marijuana probably not um I don't think there's any\nAny widespread movement to do that however you know if it does come up you can't lie in response to any officers' questions I'm so if an officer asks than you do have to be truthful about it\nUm but it is not illegal to use it in Canada as just illegal to bring it back across the border and also if you're still under the influence of marijuana when you're driving your vehicle that's also a criminal offense\nAll right so there you go and I think to to Justin emailers point he is a it seems to me wondering if they ask you have you used and you say yes are you open yourself up in any way to any further action in other words if they say are you high right now I mean I I think he's kind of wondering\nWhat are they allowed to ask you what's going to happen\n[noise] they can ask if you're still under the influence at that time on they can ask ... they don't ...\nThey can search cars they have the authority to do that absent any suspicion of wrongdoing so definitely it could lead to a car being searched um but it it's ... if they're not carrying anything across the border and they're not under the influence at that time it's not an issue for CBP\nAdjusted maybe thinking well they're going to be lenient right I mean they're they're not going to be heavy handed the laws are different in Canada than they are in the United states after October seventeenth so\nUh but in in a conversation we had ... before this program a couple of weeks ago one of the issues that came up with a ... whether it's cases like this or as we'll talk about the moment Canadian workers coming to the United states people who work in this little cannabis as an industry traveling theirs\nNot necessarily clarity or consistency I guess or or maybe there is concern that different points of entry will have a different approach is that right\nYeah there are a few different grounds of um of an invisibility they can apply to Canadian citizen so it's important to keep separate it that concerns related to Canadian citizens versus us citizens um [noise]\nBut in terms of us citizens who are returning and have used personally it's really just not possession issue and that whether they're driving under the influence that our media can certainly\nI'm not asking you as an attorney to tell people at all that anyone would be lenient about this but could you see a scenario where an agent at the border says\nOh you have some marijuana on you and the person saying look I totally forgot I still had that I'm not bringing back and it wasn't hiding it it's a new ... not don't don't even don't think they're going to be lenient now\nKnow as people have any amount on them in their vehicle that's going to be a problem\nOkay ah don't expect lenient so you just because the laws in Canada are changing I'm Jeremy ... I Know you you see a lot of of good but what kind of just doing but when it comes to lack of clarity which is something you just brought up\nWhat is concerned number one for you and something we kind of talked about before the show what's the worst case scenario when it comes to what's going to happen next with this new law change\n[noise] well I think the worst case scenario at least from our perspective does have to do with the ability of American and Canadian citizens to pass from one jurisdiction to the other um you know a a a operationally um I don't know that\nUh that Canada's a don't use program really uh uh um\nIt is concerning from [noise] from an industry perspective meaning I'm not worried that that people are going to be flocking across the borders to go a choir cannabis I'm under ... candidates laws like\nLike you might see people go to Las Vegas where cannabis as legal for adult use or Denver where cannabis as legal for adult used because I Do think that there will be a challenge\nUm flowing freely back and forth across the border now do do I think that this particular announcement by the U.S customs and border protection division of of the of the department of homeland security\nUm is you know it it is going to immediately locked down the borders and see that everybody traverse thing that uh that uh that border\nUm have their car tossed and and be pulled out and be you know questioned at length about cannabis use or or cannabis investments I don't think that's going to happen I think the risk is um largely perception um but but I Do think that that there will be\nI Do think that there could be some challenges with the freedom of people to move\nBack and forth across the border and and uh and to me that's that's the number one concern from this recent\nActivity I'm from the United States Department of homeland security as it relates to this October seventeenth transitioning Canada\nWriting for Politico Louisa Savage wrote a piece titled Canadian marijuana users workers and investors risky lifetime border band and I want to quote from\nMs Savage is peace now quote Canadians who work in the marijuana industry and those who invest in the booming pot sector risk a lifetime ban on travel to the United states according to a senior official overseeing us border operations\nUm I did a couple of times walking down the street which is like a ... one of the main drags of of Denver\nThat somebody would be sitting and standing in the corner but marijuana for in at least in Denver and I'm assuming all ... Colorado are only be used\nIn your home or smoking outside as sort of like an open container law but they do a lot of people look the other way cops not going to ask you if you're standing on the corner of a\nHotel outside let's ask her smoking a joint are not going to bother you\nBut then it leads to the question is okay what about suddenly from New York state wants to buy something and bring it back and they say well then your state laws apply and\nWhen we were getting on an airplane yesterday they had a sniffer dogs\nYou heard then you also don't lie to them when they ask you\nWell and there was a sniffer dogs\nSniffing everybody but I didn't know there was nothing for bombs or marijuana and it was laughable because you know I walked in and out decided curiosity to see what was going on and the dog was fine with me but we can elderly lady with a bad part and then this guy didn't restrain\nThe dog he went to knock you down and he was so aggressive\n... and I'm thinking she brings up back\nFor our grandkids are what are they took her into a ruin that was the last I saw her [noise]\nNo I don't know what you know what it was that he wanted to ask but they don't ... your your luggage you check your luggage okay it goes and then your backpack they did not look through my backpack the scanner went through\nBut I don't know if this is a perfect analogue for border crossings is I mean what what's your biggest worry\nWhat's gonna happen are they going to do the same thing like TSA guys are they going to set up these things where they have never machine to see if you have are they going to have dogs check everybody when\nThey come across or what are they going to do I've seen I've come across in Lewis than they had dogs walked by cars but those are bomb sniffing dogs too but what are they going to do or you're going to get certain border patrol guys are just going to look the other way because they don't want to deal with the ... and the beer\nWell let let let me turn over to ... thank you ... go ahead Daniel\n... they do have drug sniffing dogs at the border so um and they'll take them out between the cars and if a dog had signed a car and they smell something\nThe car will be searched for something in there and they don't have them a hundred percent of the time out there but they do walk them around and that's that's being done now\nCan we stress again that you think it's a very bad idea to expect any leniency or have bring it back go to Canada by some marijuana you'll probably be able to bring it back to look the other way\nDon't do it it you know [laughter]\nUm before I get Andrew in Rochester Germany you want to weigh in and then the thing that you heard there\nNo I was just going to I I you know I I agree it's not you know being caught for a very small amount of of cannabis meaning you know what whatever whatever that amount as a personal consumption amount\nIs simply not worth the down side or the risk of being um interfered with as you as you cross the border is just not worth it [noise] um so I so I I'm I'm very supportive of that\nI don't think that the likelihood is strong you know with the the the take away from all of this um inconsistency in in federal treatment is that what happens is the decision to\nGo through your car to find cannabis or to ask you questions about your cannabis use or your ownership of cannabis businesses or um you know or to enforce\nA enforce the law if cannabis is found on you or if you give us an incriminating response if there's no\nIf there's no guidance from senior management and by that I mean the federal government policy makers that make these decisions that the federal government the Congress then then that role is devolved\nTo that one guy or that one gal who happens to be working the border crossing or that one person who happens to be working the TSA or that one uh FDIC banking\nExaminer who comes into the bank in Colorado that happens to be banking a cannabis related business you're devolve thing that that discretion to that person because they don't have guidance they don't have policy guidance from the decision makers above and and and that's really that's really the rub here\nThat's exactly right and they have the border officers have an incredible amount of power\nThey refuse somebody entry to the United states and the land border crossings at least they also have the authority to do an expedited removal\nThere are two legal grounds for doing an expedited removal one is if somebody commits fried which shouldn't happen in this context that could arise that somebody lies about their drug is\nUm and other ground is a ... to ... to tell the seven which is failure to prove that you qualify for admission\nA which is also incredibly broad and what ... to remove all is is it's a a deportation proceedings that occurs right at the port of entry\nThere is no judicial review and says right in the statute that no judge has jurisdiction to review these decisions are made at the port and foreign nationals who are subject to an expedited removal are barred from seeking re entry to the United states for a five year period that could be applied\nUm and then at these drug related grounds of in this ability\nTo a lifetime bar as well um so ... that one person that's making these discretionary decisions that can affect the entire course of people's lives are\nAndrew in Rochester you're next on the phone we've got to get her only break in the hour we'll come back we're going to Andrew's calling it a couple of emails from listeners who
