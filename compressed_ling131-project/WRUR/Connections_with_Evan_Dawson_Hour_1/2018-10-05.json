Collins flake mentioned but this hour it's not a conversation about [noise] Brett Kavanaugh for say it's a\nConversation with attorneys I noticed a weeks ago yeah feels like a month or a year ago but I noticed that the one attorneys talk about what's been going on when they talk about the testimony and they talk about the evidence\nThey have different kinds of conversations\nBut I have with friends and co says I'm not an\nAnd I thought I Want to hear what is her attorneys talking about when it comes to if we're going to live this uh [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Luis given to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nIs now on track for a final Senate vote probably sometime this weekend on this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nThe voices senator Shelley Moore Capito with the majority yes vote on the procedural questioned the Senate will now continue to a final confirmation decision within thirty hours\nNPR's Scott Detrow has more\nIt was a party line vote with two exceptions Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no in West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin voted yes\nSenators can still change their minds ahead of the final up or down vote in fact Maine Senator Susan Collins a Republican\nSays her yes vote may not be final and she'll and now it's her ultimate decision later today in a speech on the Senate floor\nThe final vote will likely be held Saturday but it could be pushed to Sunday if Collins is a no Montana Republican Steve Danes won't be available to vote tomorrow because his daughter is getting married Danes says he won't skip the wedding for a vote Scott Detrow NPR News Washington\nNPR's Brakkton Booker is watching the scene outside the U.S Supreme Court across from the U.S Capitol Grounds\nThe crowds outside the U.S Supreme Court in after the Senate a procedural vote to move in with a nominee for governor the crows were not as big as they were yesterday protesters here still held signs that read a cabinet\nNPR's Brakkton Booker at the Supreme Court here in Washington the nation's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in almost fifty years in September according to a government jobs data released today but as NPR's John Ydstie reports job creation cool debate last month\nThe three point seven percent unemployment rate in September is the lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine that was during the Vietnam War when many potential workers were out of the workforce fighting in Southeast Asia\nAnd yet you see them as women who are having a very hard time making the ... decision and as we heard today you know one of them chose to vote that they know he should move on to the Senate and this is I'm\nGoing to be very interesting how these two women handle this whether they choose to vote down a party line vote with the a little bit more of them the feeling of who they are as a woman\nNow an eye on those ... are on those lines listeners at three o'clock today that this is at least the latest information I have is that Senator Susan Collins has said that at three PM today she will make a speech on the floor of the Senate and reveal how she plans to vote in the final confirmation\nVote 'em and so I guess we shall see there it's a tough that's a really tough spot to be in and I I I don't envy them it's going to be very hard to figure out if you're going to vote with your conscious you got your you know your soul and heart or if you're going to take that vote on party lines OK Christmas\nWhat stands out to me above all other things is that elections matter\nUh you know the fact of the matter is you know President Trump was elected and ah once he was elected it's who's a obligation and Judy to nominate candidates to open positions on the federal judiciary\nIt's not just the Supreme Court bench that you've had a appointments to his head scores scores are across the federal judiciary\nAnd uh you know it it it it is telling that uh the uh the president has been looking to a highly conservative or an ideological groups such as the\nFederalist Society and the Heritage Foundation to that is a judicial nominees\nThe bottom line is there's nothing illegal about that there is nothing even wrong about that\nYou use the the simple result of having won an election\nOr if you don't like what's happening get out there and vote a different way but the bottom line is you know we're we're we're looking at a you know Mr cab or judge Kavanaugh being on the bench for probably thirty five years and uh that is a very significant impact\nOf a a an election but the president one\nWe have um the phone ringing and we're gonna take some listener feedback questions for our panel of attorneys that if you want to do that this hour\nAnd you can call the program you can email us connections of WXXI excite dot org can I ask our panel to to address that question than in another another attorney brought up to me about a week ago\nThis idea that throughout his testimony judge Kevin I'll root repeatedly said look every one who was supposedly at this party have all said they didn't happen\nWhen their testimony even mark judge is I Can't recall [noise]\nUm and Sharon killing Kelly Faris I'll start with you ... what's the difference there and that gap and how significant is that significant to you\nOh it's a huge difference and it's a very telling difference judge Kavanaugh actually said that these people refuted that is an out and out lie I'm which goes to the heart of his integrity and raises the question does even have the integrity\nIf a judge isn't able to get the facts straight or to see the facts in an objective manner then they shouldn't even be a town justice let alone on the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd Cary Sherman store so I agree that there is a big difference between a how the testimony of witnesses was framed and what we understand it to be the um ah not being able to recall is vastly different\nThan saying that something did not happen saying something that didn't happen is an affirmative statement\nNo it didn't happen saying I don't recall um it's too long ago that's that's different and it doesn't mean that doesn't happen the other point that I'd like to make about that\nIs that the uh there was criticism saying it's a he said she said situation\nMuch of life is a he said she said situation we require a jurors to make decisions in those circumstances all of the time and it is maybe a statement about the times maybe a statement about\nHow you can\nPresent facts in a particular way to try to sway the Senate or the public\nBut it is wrong to to believe that things don't happen or things that didn't happen just because they didn't have they they weren't televised on your uh by video on your phone whatever\nOkay role in it [noise] you know I think this um this knife cuts both ways because we all know was attorneys here it is really hard if not impossible to prove a negative\nIt's something you just can't do and I think while I Would have chosen very different words I'm Kevin and Kevin ... use of them um he didn't really express that and that sort of cuts that other way I'm from us forward because she doesn't have\nAnother person that can say I saw it will say they sought and that creates that the concept of doubt that we always talk about in criminal matters\nUm but as we were speaking before this isn't a criminal matter this is whether we are looking at one human being and whether that human has the right integrity demeanor and all the other things that come to the table to be a Supreme Court judge and when you're looking at that accusation\nYou you you can't and you shouldn't look at it in a vacuum which would be simply looking at it and saying there's only one person saying this or two and we can't prove it\nThat the mere fact that it's out there means that you have to look and investigate it and not put a timeline on it not put five business days six business days you really look into who this person is and who he was when he was younger\nAnd you want to jump back into yeah I just wanted to point out the difference between an uh it's my understanding that there was a memo put together by the quote prosecutor I'm also referred\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comes from our members\nAnd from ... a small batch come butcher brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what growl are available to go on line at cat ... dot com\nBut let me ... let me just add one more thing in a in a moment I mean I get your phone calls but you you know the phones are burning up this afternoon but let me just say from the perspective of some attorneys I've spoken to\nThey tell me that they don't see that they don't think practically there should be a difference in this case today understand this is technically quote unquote a job interview done a criminal prosecution but their view as it is such a serious matter and a potential slippery slope\nThat if you deny this position without any other\n... without more than Dr Ford's testimony compelling or not\nThat it invites a sort of game and the future and Lindsey Graham Senator Graham even threatened Democrats and said well do it to you if you can take down Kevin which is a sort of a kind of a ghastly thing to to threaten but it's out there and so when I talked to some attorneys\nOr their view is that no it it just you should be beyond a reasonable doubt otherwise you can't deny this men even though it's not a criminal prosecution sounds like the attorneys in this room do not agree with that\nSo part of part of the the issue for attorneys as we used to trials\nWe used to cross examination where you can challenge the veracity of what somebody's saying we're used to a due process things to the ... but that is not written into what advice and consent is so so it all depends on what you want to\nBruce my point there is that again elections matter who controlled the Senate at that point was that the Democrats no it was the Republicans and so they were able to examine up\nIts checks and balances examine you've checks are all in one party state or whether it be the Republicans or Democrats that's ... that's how this is going to break down and start moving or not\nMoving All right ... on that subject suing fair port wants to keep that thread going go ahead sue\nYa I mean you know if it if the Senate is indeed a responsible for advice and consent they choose to ignore or a nomination for a duly elected president I mean I think that they're talking on both sides of their mouth\nShocking shocking players and all it was never had that ever [laughter]\nOh I'm sure you try not to be cynical you know what you don't want to become cynical about politics but Robert enough airport seize politics all over this go ahead Robert\nYeah thanks for taking my call if\nThis was a legitimate concern Dianne Feinstein what a racist at the very beginning of the confirmation process she sat on this for what a month and a half [noise] um and uh I just look at this is the nuclear option\nWas a intended to be deployed only if there was nothing that could find on Kavanaugh's legal record legal background that they could use against him he was brought up at the worst possible time for him to defend themself\nAnd ah I ... the whole thing just reeks of politics as you can imagine I mean I I don't think there's any doubt about it\nYeah so Rob I'm going to let the the panel hit that but before I Do I just kind of want to take your temperature on this what percentage confident are you the doctor for delegations are accurate\n[noise] I think that ah it's less than fifty fifty I mean the thing is is you can't identify where something took place what year it took place how you got there and how he got home I I I just think that uh\nI I don't know how you defend yourself against an accusation like that if the accuser is allowed to uh not nailed down details that would allow someone to say hey I was there hey when when I was not\nThere okay so less than fifty fifty rubber thanks for the phone call so Robert is saying look in the process he's he viewed this as a nuclear option for the Democrats Melanie I saw you kind of reacting a little bit what do you make of that\nYou know that would surprise me I'll be honest I'm I think this is politics and it wouldn't surprise me if it was held 'em to the most appropriate time or they make the biggest slash\nUm what's made this so urgent now with President Trump giving the FBI literally seven days or less to try to put out some kind of investigation report so to make nuclear that's what happened when Trump put this timeline on it not when it was brought out this easily could have been deflated or at least\nStrung out for a while while the American public thought about it forgot about it whatever they do\nAnd then the investigation could have gone up for two or three weeks and he still could have been elected before midterms um but now you know trying to push this through and doing five days I think is really what made this nuclear\nOkay um Sharon's\n[laughter] makes it easy for you ... do you see politics and this of course\nI've yes of course they're always politics in that in the nominations for Supreme Court but even though their politics that does that lesson that legitimacy of the planes or questions or the way things are being done so\nWe don't really know what happened behind the scenes and I don't know if we'll ever know what happened behind the scenes and its political fodder both ways I think to um ... you know if they'd come out earlier\nThan it might not have been so politicized that that you know here's this issue being raised solely\nFor purposes of defeating it at this late date I've been ah ask questions on FBI background checks before and that they're very thorough they goes through a lot so you know we don't know what information who had er or why it was held\nThe ... the other Sharon is absolutely correct\nWe've got information now that that people are contending what they're contending and you can't it's what once they horses out of the barn or the old phrase you can't put it back in you have to to look at that somehow\nThe other piece of it though is that what it is equally\nRelevant and people need to look at is a ... a is the testimony and and the ... for example I don't know if anybody mentioned it before but former Supreme Court judge a John Paul Stevens\nHas now said that while he supported Kavanaugh previously he can't support him now because of the part is the nature of his remarks so it's it's just a different ballgame than it might have been had it come out earlier\nAnd a different ballgame had judge Kavanaugh more a bully and mature early handled and thought about his reaction instead of just feeling for the first thing that came into his mind\nWell I I I Confess when he opens his statement last Thursday I thought he was withdrawing but um but certainly not does looked like he is now headed for confirmation I got a lot more phone calls to get through can I just ask and I'll I'll ask\nChris Thomas as the male attorney on the panel a lot of talk about well men should be afraid men should be afraid I'm you know you should be worried about um any accusation being able to ruin your life it cetera do you feel that way as an attorney as a someone with family friends that you think about is that a is that a concern for\nThe due process is going to be gone and that is that as President Trump recently said President Trump said it's a good time to be a woman at the bad dangerous time to be a man\nWell I think that's still I think that's\nFairly comedic actually um you know all you have to take all you have to do is take a look at you know I think we only just had to pay day not that long ago\nSo let's let's just let's sort of like boil the ridiculous news out of the president's comment and just ask you directly though do you think there's a legitimate concern\nThat it's too easy to accuse usually a man and the men are at risk that's the real risk\nI wouldn't say it's too easy I Would have ... there was a pendulum swinging here and you take a look at the title nine cases that are going through the courts right now\nAnd uh until fairly recently uh the courts and I'm speaking obviously in large generalities here courts would simply rubber stamps what colleges and universities were doing with respect to a alleged sexual assaults on campus and typically those were\nAccusations by young women against young men and the school without\nReally any process or very little process might ah just simply rubber stamps the uh the decision that was made by the University of the college to expel the young man\nAnd the pendulum has over about the last two to three years under swung bat swing back to the middle\nI'm and I and I think that what we're seeing here with this nomination is a a swing of the pendulum to you know to that point where\nYou know some men have that concern um frankly I don't think it's a tremendous concern because in in this is in this context it is not these are criminal charges\nThat are being laid a you know in terms of a missed your judge Kavanaugh or he's going to be confirmed because of the power dynamic in the Senate and even if you weren't what was the worst thing that was going to happen to him is going to still be a lifetime appointee on a circuit court of appeals\nCan I just I just want to say no way unsure [laughter] I just want to say that that uh there is a point\nThat ah that um that I think it's a really important point and that is that that I think that the me too movement started because women didn't have a voice for so long\nI think the danger is that with me too movement sometimes the people who are accused don't have a voice either and I'm never in favor of the situation where people don't have voices I think they need to have voices\nI think that the rules are changing definitely changing and I think that it's important for men to realize that they're changing\nUm and I have ah children in college going to college and I've lectured both the girls and the boys about the changing roles and how to be much more careful in the way they handle things\n[noise] me too okay um [noise] boy look let's go to work and have to lock the phones for a moment because there's so many phone calls to let me just try to get through as many as we can hear 'em at a point long long list you're I think this is still Noel is that you know well\nThat's not is that no that Gary in Bloomfield go ahead Gary\nOh okay again yes thank you um yeah my concern a was with the gentleman who was the rating of Ford's testimony or his testimony her testimony\nWas ... [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] are you there you're yeah I gotta I'm Sorry I had to turn the radio off\nBecause of [laughter] that's always a good thing if you call radio show turned the radio off listen to the phones go ahead Gary\nYeah um yeah well two things one is her testimony I I have a psychological background and her test them money and ... what you would expect from someone who is suffering that kind of trauma they do not report\nAnd should yeah sure absolutely sure I think it was so that point I think is well taken if Dr Ford comes out and says wasn't that funny I made it all up well yes that's a problem Paul in Brighton go ahead Paul\nLike are you there Paul depressive hello yeah go ahead give it tight\nI'd like to preface my statement by saying that I'm sick about Trump I Am sick about the way he's taking this country and I'm stuck about him stuck in the courts including the Kavanaugh but I Would look\nTalk about if the shoe was on the other foot and it's the Democrats control the Senate and the president city and the Democrats brought a a decisive candidate that was quite left leaning and then at the last minute Republicans come up with some\nAh information that couldn't quite be proved would the Democrats act any differently\nThan Republicans and what I Want to say is the problem here is the polarization of the United states more so for me than in you know looking another appointing another conservative to the court ... the country is frozen\nAnd Donald Trump has so much responsibility for just because of the person that huge\nYeah I I think that's a very fair question what would the Democrats do if things were flipped here\nPaul I think we'd be looking exactly the same thing I I I really truly do I think we've got such a partisan break up I think sure it's going to disagree with me but I I think we've got such a a partisan break up in D. C. and throughout the United states that we would be looking at potentially exactly the same thing\nI don't think democratic women it's largely speaking would would tolerate the exact same reaction\nBut that's not one but that's not what Paul was saying he didn't he wasn't he didn't put out that that what was the leadership of party do he wasn't saying that it was a sex assault he was saying just generally if the if the Republicans pulled out you know allegations yeah how long I I'm On my own mind I'm\nThinking if the if the script was flipped just in terms of party\nAnd and it was the same kind of allegation what would the Democratic party do and the question is I mean the best answer so far\nIs that until recently nothing look at Bill Clinton look at so many years of nothing nothing nothing but now Al Franken Al Franken now out of course Keith Ellison is sort of a a gray area for Democrats best is but I think what we're seeing is it's still hard to move the needle in your party's but\nThe people who are actually outraged about sexual assault real sexual assault survivors of which there are millions\nHave spoken up in a way that makes it hard to ignore now and so I think maybe that is starting to move but I don't know Paul\nAnd that and then I think it also depends who's\nYou know if you're looking at really slipping exactly the script and we had that a Trump like figure that happens to be a Democrat\nYou know he's gonna bullied just about everybody in line on his party too so I think if you you really flip it and look at exactly what we have now and just put the Republicans and Democrats I think we would see potentially the same thing going on with the possibility of maybe another woman or to stepping out\nLast year I think the Republicans and Democrats both play politics but in very different way south\nFor the Democrats I'm not saying in orange hatch and Mitch\nMcConnell out there selling and spewing they go about it in a different way so I don't think I think that they would play games trying to get their nominee confirmed of course but I think it would be ... by different very different rules [noise]\nYeah and and Paul I would look up the story of the state Senate candidate Julian Salazar for the Democrats downstate who you know has been ... was sort of an inspirational figure only her biography doesn't really check out as it started to come out in in the press she still wins\nOr her election and the Democratic primary and is still supported by many democratic stakeholders\nAnd if that were a Republican boy Democrats would be trying to run that candidate out of town so yeah it's tough I'm as we close the hour here I Want to thank all of our guest for being here and just asked all four\nAs attorneys with a lot of experience not just in your field of law but observing what's going on in the national scene did anybody think Brett Kavanaugh was not getting confirmed because you've already said that he's getting confirmed immoral\nYeah and what I Would simply at is this this whole process this last two weeks or three weeks ways a orderly bearer and naked the fact that this is about\nPower confirmed a question from no question Sharon I agree okay I agree that oh I cling to help tenacious [laughter]\nWe're going to see and as as we told you earlier this hour and if you've been listening to NPR News throughout the day here the\nCloture vote when fifty one forty nine in favor of moving forward to a full\nSenate confirmation vote that coming tomorrow\nAnd a lot of the assumption now is that a judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed I Want to thank all of our guests for being here Sharon Kelly Faris sharing Stiller Chris Thomas Melanie walk all attorneys bringing their expertise and background and experience thank you very much for your insects are very much appreciate and give the kids\nAre a short break more connections coming up [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views expressed do not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent of W ... you're strictly prohibited connections with ...

Letterman and a laughing about\nCrazy things including women throwing onion rings on to erect penises for David Letterman to get up and walk off the stage in the middle of the conversation\nOn the path of from one to the other is the story of the play becoming Dr ruth which opens the center stage season of tomorrow night after over six thrown to the twenty first and we're here with Karen Bauer sock who is playing that incredible iconic\nWoman what surprised you most about her and her biography her personal story\nI Would have to say the her military experience when she was in Israel she was a sniper\nIn Palestine she learned how to take a machine gun apart and put it back together with our eyes closed and when you picture our version of Dr ruth she's a little matronly lady she was very small she was funky and she's outspoken but to picture her and so as as as you know\nStanding on a roof with a rifle looking down over the barricades at a at the city gates and Jerusalem or Palestine you know\nThat was something unimaginable for me that she did so many things that that now I have to as playing her imagine what that felt like imagine what that is that it's hard to pick one but I think that one probably the most\nAnd so how much is your own creation in terms of the way you present her on stage and how much is really careful study that you talked about what\nWe as I said there's a lot of evidence of what she sounded like how she moves like um there are books she has an autobiography and which I started to read and then I stopped\nBecause there were discrepancies in marketing to remain who wrote the play you know wrote a play based on many interviews with her I'm sure I'm but sometimes there are ... you know took dramatic license their characters that are Malcolm aided her switched around for the dramatic content of the play and I also think the book was published in the eighties\nAnd reading about ... and the play was in the nineties I think her opinions about things change so I found that the book was making my head a little crazy trying to figure out which Dr ruth\nI was playing and I didn't want to confuse myself because it as if she she was she in the play she obsessed with the dates that's how she got she was taught an early age that dates or how we know who we are remembering who we were\nAnd so there's a lot of dates to remember and I didn't want to interfere with that separate the book aside and I went back to it when I had questions about I don't understand how did you really feel at that age about Palestine and then I could go back to the book and look in and get that information\nBut in terms of heavy researcher reading reading up on her I did more research at the live Dr ruth\nI think this is a question for both of you because you know for you as a performer it's one thing for Ralph as\nA with a JC center stage just another you want the audience to enjoy themselves always really coming up for a night of entertainment absolutely but ultimately you also want the audience to maybe go home with\nMaybe a different understanding of the world or a person or a concept her idea so for us playing Dr ruth what are you hoping the audience will leave the juicy center stage with\nWell she makes it easy because we look at her even today and she is full of this is the best for life\nSo even though she's telling stories have great sadness in her life\nExperiences that were difficult challenges that she had she always she was taught at a very early age by a grandmother to be a people pleaser for lack of a better word\nHer grandmother said always be cheerful always smiling be cheerful and and a member of that you are loved and she says repeatedly through the play that that love that you had in the first ten years of her life carried her through\nAll of the experiences that she had along the way and it is I still think in her makeup today so that's how you can pay I can take these people on this Journey Through some of the difficult parts of her life and the challenge in part because she always\nIs looking for it because she always is looking to the positive and that's what makes the experience positive one for the audience\nAnd I think that the other thing the audience is\nWe'll walk away from after seeing a play about doctors is not just to go wow what an amazing woman who had an amazing life\nBut to also see how she created her amazing life which was by being unafraid to speak her mind by being unafraid to take on challenges\nTo have something knock her down she would say fine if that didn't work for me I'll go on and do something else instead she had three marriages\nUm and she was on afraid even at an early age to say you know what this isn't working less stop and let's move on if she hadn't been able to do that many many times in her life to just reinvent herself\nAnd push yourself forward and speak her mind she never would have been the kind of person that talked in front of a room full of radio producers and somebody said let's give this woman her own radio show\n'em and it was just because of who she was as a person and I hope that inspires people to be also unafraid to speak their minds and do what they are passionate about\nYou mentioned a ... a David Letterman or parents ... was there one I'm trying to think of the other media appearances you know the the daytime talk stuff was there one above others that sort of launched her in her career\nWas radio really I'm Jay radio yeah so she was working for Planned Parenthood and a group of radio producers wanted somebody to come in and talk to them about these issues that were being discussed that Planned Parenthood so that they could deal with how to talk about them on the air\nAnd so she went and spoke for Fifteen minutes and people ask questions and someone said to her we want to start a show with you and it started as a Fifteen minute broadcast that like midnight or something yeah\nUm and it was so popular that went to an hour and then it got to expand it and then it went national from being a local show to a national showed an international than television and it just snowballs from their\n... well I think of my own upbringing ... my parents never had to the extent parents do this ... my parents never had that talk with me now I'm I feel I feel somewhat from my my son because when he was of age\nAnd we're talking about what of age means in the moment but when he's older\nI'm going to be very explicit about my expectations [laughter] um and um and in general\nYeah how I expect him to have to conduct himself but the question of of when you start that process is an interesting one doctor Ruth made it easier for people to understand that they could talk about it that you could talk about it with family that you could talk about it with kids\nAnd recently the Atlantic monthly wrote a piece about sex ed in the Netherlands and I want to read a little bit from this if we could and ask are our guests about this because they have\n... I think it's fair to say a pretty different approach though it's also said fair to say in this country it's really a state by state that we have abstinence only education in almost a contiguous block of the American south\nWhich happens to coincide with the highest rates of unintended teen pregnancy but and STDs yeah it's true I mean again that's not a commentary that just looking at numbers but there's state by state is different but on the whole we're not quite where a lot of Scandinavia is in other parts of Europe so let me read from this piece in the Atlantic monthly\nUm and this is what the author of the peace Bonnie rough wrote quote while researching my book on sex education\nI observed how Dutch parents healthcare workers and educators achieved these public health results by being almost unbelievably open with children of all ages about bodies in relationships and in part because of its low teen birth rate\nThe Netherlands ranks as one of the most gender equal countries in the world placing third on the United nations development program gender inequality index the U.S meanwhile doesn't even crack the top forty on that list\nThese are the numbers on average Dutch un American teenagers have sex for the first time around the same age between Seventeen and Eighteen on average but with dramatically different results teen pregnancy has been on the decline of the United states for the past three decades but\nAmerican teenagers still give birth at five times the rate of their Dutch peers who also have fewer abortions in the United states people under twenty five make up\nHalf of all new sci cases each year while young people in the Netherlands account for ten percent of new cases in that country again that Bonnie\nRough in the Atlantic on a recent piece and so the take away I think Dr grants is\nThat this is a country that is really sort of Dr ruth writ large in how to approach of education you know from the start on afraid and I don't think that means that four or five and six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "city": "Rochester", "day": "05"}
