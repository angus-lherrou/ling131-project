NPR News Washington\nThe Taliban are claiming they were behind a deadly attack in southern Afghanistan that claimed the lives of three provincial officials including Kandahar is powerful police chief Jeff for glass report the Afghan guards carried out the attack\n... was respected and fears in Kandahar as police chief in the birthplace of the Taliban he was praised for bringing peace to the city but the Taliban tried to kill him dozens of times and really can self was controversial human rights watch called him torture and chief for alleged illegal prisons and heavy handed tactics against those who opposed him\nI have not we sent a number of letters and emails and have received no response or however I did just learned yesterday that he apparently plans to be at a candidate forum at U. R. M. C. on Monday hosted by the league of women voters so I'm very excited for that\nI mean I I Know rich just sort of they're broadcasting circles and just in terms of on the personal size nice person are you surprised you haven't heard back at all\nI'm not I'm a traditionally incumbents don't debate it\nUm it isn't something that I think people do unless they feel like they need to or if they are particularly a committed to just democracy generally they feel like they should uh if I were elected I Would plan to debate into the future and he wanted to challenge me because I think that it's important\nUh but it it does not surprise me that he would not want to appear in an adversarial form of you generally vote district ticket Democrats um historically I have sometimes in local races and digital races I might change [noise]\nUm but just just where my values like it's not because of a partisan bent but because more of where my personal philosophy and politics are the Democratic candidate is generally the one that aligns with\nMe okay but it's not impossible for you to envision a Republican member of the legislature and say hey I think they're actually doing a pretty good job yeah okay so you don't feel that way with rich ... what are your issues would return [noise] well\nI think again ritual he's a nice enough guy a button for years he's never held a town hall he's never held a public forum he um is not open in my experience to meeting with people who disagree with him I have spent more time standing on the street yelling at his front door than speaking directly to him in fact I had never spoken to him until I started running against them [noise]\nUm I I think that his a while I Believe that he personally and philosophically genuinely believes what he believes I don't think that he's pretending\nI think that his values are out of line with the people have this district this district has a twenty two thousand Democrat enrollment advantage and went for Hillary by Eighteen points it should be represented by someone who better reflects the views of the people who live here so what does priority one if you go to Albany and the state Senate\nSo I think given what we're seeing in the Supreme Court passing the reproductive health act is very important to me are also making sure that we get a clean bill for a PR reform for our teachers through those are some things that should have been able to pass at the end of last term that didn't get through\nWas talking about those individually and starting with the reproductive health act\nI think it's a pretty strong assumption that a lot of people have that rose going to get overturned obviously we don't know that um and there's still a lot of speculation there but it's certainly possible now with the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd we could see that in the next I mean as soon as you know two to three years and years in case it gets gets there and if that happens it's you know there's a lot of unanswered questions but assuming it happens in a way that would send it to a quote unquote back to the states to to really sort of\nRun the rules or you could have twenty states overnight where abortion is not legal and then you'd have New York but you know I remember talking to Rob asked a RINO when he was running for governor\nOr what four years ago now and he said you're never going to have to worry about abortion in this state is New York state is the law the land and New York state would never he said it's a red herring why why even talking about this ... what do you think\nUh I think that there's a misunderstanding of what the state of the law is in New York New York was one of the first states to legalize abortion in Nineteen Seventy pre roe and in doing so what they did was they a modified the penal code were actually one of the few states I think it's only Wisconsin and us who's still regulates abortion through the penal code instead of the health code\nIn New York it is permissible to have abortions up to twenty four weeks and then there are no protections following that except for a life of the mother so protections in New York for health of the mother or for a terminal fetal abnormalities simply don't exist we read them in from the case law a federally\nIn fact even right now if you found out that you were in some way threatened to become disabled as a result of your pregnancy or you unfortunately had um a fetus with a a terminal issue you'd have to leave the state to get the kind of care that you need people off and go to Colorado\nAnd we need to codified here at the state level the protections that we've been reading in federally to ensure that everyone has the options that we as a state believe we should have\nFair to say you think that abortion is going to be an issue state and federal in terms of debate now that we have this confirmation going forward for a while now\nYes absolutely I've been a lifelong advocate for reproductive justice issues and I have never been as nervous as I Am right now\nOkay I'm ... can you tell us a little bit about the experience and your own family and I lost her dad and I want to talk about health care how you view does that impact your thoughts on health care um\nIt probably solidified for me a little bit more uh my father had a number of a disability yeah congestive heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder he was a vet and he had some mental health issues as well as um addiction problems\nAnd I'll tell you that uh if it wasn't for a VA benefits my dad would not have walked me down the aisle he would not have seen he graduated from law school and it's because he had access to free health care and I know that especially the kind of guy that he was even with the health care was hard enough to get him to the doctor\nUm he was in the hospital for seven weeks before he died he like many people spent almost all of his lifetime healthcare costs in the last two months of his life was very very expensive uh no one should have to\nConsider whether or not to get treatment based on whether they could afford it I'll tell you my dad had a heart attack on my twenty first birthday\nAnd he did not go to the hospital for two days because he didn't want to pay the ER co pay and by the time he got to the hospital forty percent of the heart with that issue because he waited ago ah I think I still have my dad today if he'd gone a little bit earlier\nI'm no I've had a number of phone calls and emails over the years from conservative listeners who will take issue with your characterization of your father having gotten quote free health care they will say there is no such thing\nOr and the reason I was Cuomo voter even though my personal politics probably aligned more next and um I Do not think that your first job in politics should be as the head executive of the twelve artist academy in the world\nI think it came down to fundamentally to a lack of experience for me I don't think that she should have you know needs to run for dog catcher or anything I'm obviously running for state Senate or the first time candidate but I'm being the head executive of anything whether it is a country where the state shouldn't be your first for ... for a into public service\nSeventy minor would would say than if you aligned with Cynthia Cynthia Nixon politics but not her experience you ought to be voting for minor in November are you gonna vote for money\nI'm I Am a\nProbably still going to lean Cuomo because I think that it is important again even though I think we do disagree on some issues um that as a party we unite at this time\nI'm On all a\nHouses of the legislature and in the governor's office to stand up against what we're seeing coming out of Washington okay\nI Do think voters like to know if you can sort of be ... and I'm sure you feel you can be an independent operator the you know the party unity matters but also an independent voice matters whereas the party or where has Cuomo gone wrong\n[noise] um I think that there's ever since ... the number of people who say corruption at the doors to me as an issue that's motivating to them has tripled\nAnd I think that um we're really motivated as a community as a state and as a country to start making real changes I personally am not taking corporate money except that my love for the law firm I work for five hundred dollars\nThis afternoon at four welcome back to connections I'm Evan Dawson\nWe're joined now by Jeremy ... who is another candidate for the state Senate and once again I Will remind our listeners that we invite\nCandidates for prominent federal state and local officers to join us during the campaign season here on connections obviously we prefer to have opposing candidates come on together to work through a debate the issues um and the truth is it's been harder to convince the incumbents to come in but we want our listeners to know do we have asked\nSenator Joe robot come alongside his opponent Jeremy Cooney\nA senator Roebuck has not been able to make that work so far\nHe has declined the opportunity to come on the program so far before the election but we hope that changes and um so what we shall see but we do have ... who is the Democrats running in the fifty six Senate district for the New York state Senate Germany walking to the program thanks for being here think driving me I haven't I Want to start by talking about your background and\nUh it's I think it's valuable for our listeners to know before we get into your work history and why you decided to run for this office where were you born\n[laughter] so I was born in a orphanage in Calcutta, India but I was raised\nIt's right here in the city of Rochester I grew up in the south wage I was adopted by a single mom who taught an MTC for almost three decades and I went through the city schools\nAnd then got a college scholarship to go on into college and in law school uh but I'm I'm a Rochester guy our ... our CSP got proud graduate and graduate school the art school\nThe arts um and how did you like it growing up how did you appreciate Rochester\nOh I Love Rochester and I had such a great experience and the city school district or had great teachers great classmates are really great experience as I can tell you that I was very active in my uh south wedge or city community I was active in my church community\nI was a boy scout troop two hundred unfortunately they just closed down a couple of years ago but over in the same benefits area and a wasn't Eagle Scout\nTell us about the work history before we get into what you want to do in Albany sure so I'm not new to politics I've been in a democratic public service for about Fifteen Years I got my start working for the way congresswoman Louise Slaughter down in Washington\nAnd does have worked for a couple of the governors here in New York Governor Paterson the Governor Cuomo and then of course uh recently served as the chief of staff to mayor love we weren't at city hall\n[noise] can I ask when you went to Washington why that turn John politics as opposed turning you off given everything that we hear about Washington and\nListen to work for a Louise Slaughter is an honor and privilege Louise Slaughter I'm Talking about Russia absolutely and you know what she had her own culture she's had her own pace in Washington so for me it was the attraction of working and learning from her and especially as right out of college right so is my first job\nAnd you know to work for Louise Slaughter and on issues that were really health focus that was her passion and it was my passion\nAnd uh that was such a great opportunity\nAnd now you want to be a member of the New York state Senate you are challenging longtime incumbent Joe robot why did you decide on this particular race and this particular level of government\nAfter twenty five years I Believe it's time for a change in this district right so I grew up in the fifty six Senate district I still live obviously and the fifty six Senate district and I can tell you a lot has happened since Joe robot was first elected he was thirty three years old when he was first elected right\nAnd he went to serve in the state assembly as a Democrat and then flipped over to be quite the conservative Republican and the state Senate and where he's been the last Fifteen Years\nBut here's what's changed or the school district is very different place than it was when I was in school we talked about earlier a commonsense gun safety is needed more than ever I was in high school when Columbine first took place\nA and health care we talked about health earlier I lost my mom a few years ago to cancer and that was a very difficult time in my life\nUh obviously but what was really difficult was trying to navigate a very complex health care system in New York\nAnd ultimately I made a decision after going through that process with hers that no family should have to go through what my family went through with navigating healthcare is just reimburse of all is is not you know can we afford this surface or treatment can be not you know we we just have to do better because I Believe health care as a write in this country\nAll right so if you go to Albany what is issue number one what makes you the most [noise] well\nI think that Janet answer just a few minutes ago the reproductive health fact I Would agree with her\nIn that uh but when I say change I really mean that it's time to send a new generation of leadership to Albany\nAnd what do you mean by that is you want to change the culture of Albany need to change the rules of the game I Believe in comprehensive ethics reform I Believe in term limits I Believe in banning outside income I Believe in the public financing of campaigns right\nThese are things that incumbents who have been there for over two decades in the case that senator robots are never going to make a you know a substantial progress on\nIt just talked about and I think we all can agree especially with the assembly miner ego announcement just last week that this is a culture that it's not a democratic issue or a Republican issue it's a cultural issue that has to be done better\nOkay we're going to get back there and just second you did mention again your opponent of senator robots have you had a chance to appear with him in any debate so far in this campaign season\nWe had not had a formal debate although we both attend to the candidates and they just the other week at in Charlotte community association and so we had a chance to both address some issues of face to face but it wasn't a traditional debate as you would think about and television\nK. you ever what's your relationship like with the senator\nI think it's fine um you know we have a very different opinion on the views and you know we we can we can be in a room together and be polite and cordial but again this is about representing the views of this district which I Do not believe he represents the views\nRight so when you say a new generation of Democrats is that an age a statement\nYou know it's about a new way of thinking about leadership in Albany ... what's the definition of insanity\nOver doing something over and over again I think a different result what's the difference of Albany electing the same people over and over again expecting a different result\nHere's here's the thing I've been I've been running a grassroots campaign since early part of the summer we have been knocking on doors seven days a week from Rockport to Brian and here's this in this different we get to the door we don't just give talking points we shut up and we listen\nAnd we say what's on your mind with keeping you up at night what are you most frustrated by and it's the same things over and what are you here most of its its reproductive justice and I think that's because of what's happening in Washington with the cabinet confirmation but it's also again healthcare access and affordability is commonsense gun safety I just had a parent tell me last night\nThat her son who's in Brighton schools who is a first grader\nHad to do a active shooter drills and he was terrified because they had to line up and there's there's windows in the classroom\nAnd they had all these first graders climb under their desks and hide and then have to be quiet for five minutes and this is this cannot be the new normal in our education system and in our country\nAnd this is a clear example of where Joe robot and I are very different on this issue right I have to just like ... and I had the support of moms demand action which is the organization that supports gun sense candidates\nA but Joe has the highest rating from the n._r._a. he in fact has received the most amount of money from the an array of any state senator in New York so when you talk about march for our lives and this movement that we're hearing from the next generation of New Yorkers high school students today\nDo you think that that's the kind of leader that's going to listen and make those\nRest of changes to gun safety was I don't think so\nWell you're talking in generalities about gun safety so let's get specific here are you in favor of of any form of confiscation\nYes I support the extreme risk protection order or or bow as it's called that was a piece of legislation that was voted down just a few months ago in the last ... what would it to\nA that would allow law enforcement officers to take away a gun if they believe that the ... the awful gun owner was a posing a danger to themselves or to someone else that could be a mental health issue it could be a stressful situation that could be a criminal action\nUm but it would allow them to make the judgment of commonsense safety in that moment and then of course the court would allow\nTo be able to return back onto the owner and at different times\nWhat about other forms of confidence ... what about Tim let's just talk about semi automatic do you think we ... we ought to be able to own semi automatic you know\nAnd if we make it illegal to purchase them for the existing stock that's out there should it be confiscated no okay\nSo I think we have to be very clear about that you know their rights that were given to people and they have a exercise their rights and I actually I think for the record I think the Democrats get a bad rap on this issue right\nI I Believe that the vast majority of lawful gun owners do the right thing they want to do the right thing they're not represented by the views in a aspirations of the n._r._a.\nI in fact you know that's an ... I'm not for taking away people's guns I have shot guns I'm an Eagle Scout I have rifle merit badge right but that doesn't mean that we can't do those common sense restrictions and I guess owning a semi automatic weapon I Believe is one of those things that we can do to help prevent the tragic loss of death she'll gun violence\nSo what's it going to be that's going to actually stop mass school shootings done what's gonna happen that will have will have a world where that is much ... more European more more what we see in Japan where society is don't have ... what's it going to be what's gonna happen\nThe honest answer is the cultural change right that it's not it's not one piece of legislation that's gonna make a difference there but what we can do is that we know when there are situations whether it's mental health related whether it's stress trauma induced about when we have people who have access to guns whether it's a\nA a a lawful gun owner who leaves a firearm on attendance in a home right not locked up safely so that that has access to that gone up by a non lawful gun owner right these are the things that we can do\nAnd people come up to me Republicans and Democrats by the way and say we're excited to support you because we've never had anyone who looks like us serve in Albany and we want to come see you in Albany and I believe that's important\n[noise] All right so you got time for a quick phone\nCan we do not sure I let me grab Adam in Newark go ahead Adam\nHey I a really big in Germany a pitcher I ah I think him and Alaska ... drove it right down the center of what I Would call objective\nThinking where yeah so what do you want smaller issues but we all we are more focused on issues that we also support\nBigger picture which Cuomo mean they talk about you know they'll say is the fact that in a certain they asked me the biggest thing call Margaret did was stand up to the fracking industry\nOr we might be participating in the industry but we're not we don't have wells in the finger lakes down a little southern tier um I I\nThink that politics right now is becoming very emotional I think I said this before and also that you brought up that Germany what Native American heritage\nOr no no no it is South Asian ... he'd be an Indian American a with a heritage from\nOh oh excuse me I I mean\n... million Columbus he thought he found that the uh [laughter] and you mix it all up but I got on it\nNow but um I like to say that I appreciate listening to the progressive views and I think that's a whining with the generation of your guys' age where we're we're we still know what's going on but we want to be progressing forward\nFor a brief they're listening to the conversation\nAdam thanks for the phone call what do you think Dr\n... thank you Adam and I would just say that is when we got into this campaign this campaign has never been about Joe Roebuck\nThis campaign has been about what's next for upstate New York\nI Love Rochester I grew up in Rochester I was educated in Rochester I live in Rochester I Want to have a family here in Rochester so I Want to have a say in what our community and went our state does to make sure that the next generation of New Yorkers have the same opportunities than I did look I I\nI Am a so grateful to have the opportunity to run for office I mean let's think about this\nI came to this country with nothing my ... my I always said I was born in the jet way of the Rochester international airport when the nurse handed me to my mom and through that process I grew up and fell in love with upstate New York now\nEspecially now as the Senate is turning we need to make sure that Rochester in upstate New York has representation in this new Democratic Senate look we can't control the politics of Washington DC but what we can do stand up for values is upstate New Yorkers and I'm determined to do that\nLast minute so let me just ask you I Know you have gone door to door you've talked to a lot of voters and certainly you talked to voters who are more conservative than you or have supported senator robotic or have questions about your politics how do you bridge divides here this does feel like we're afraid a little bit politically and it's um\nIt's a team sport that is really tough to sort of bridge those differences how are you going to be able to do that\nMhm [noise] so I think we're sick with the issues right so what are the issues that we have more in common we talk about issues and we were talking about parties and I think again this is another generational difference of\nStop voting the party line all the time do what's best for people in your district right so this district and I'm looking to represent\nHis overwhelmingly democratic voted for Hillary by double digits whatever Brock by double digits since President Trump was elected twice as many Democrats have registered to vote in the fifty six and a district Republicans right\nBut despite that that doesn't mean that we can't find common ground 'cause I think it's upstate or is in Rochester and we look at things a little bit differently than New York city's like for example right so we need to stand up state representatives to the state house\nTo fight for our values and upstate which are different than some of the priorities and values of downstate so what you're talking about affordable housing whether you're talking about job creation in student loans that these are the things that matter to us in upstate and I'm committed to bring that next generation voices Albany on behalf of us\nOnline where Jeremy Cooney Jeremy ... dot com Jeremy ... is a candidate for state Senate in the ... district we invited his opponent who is the longtime incumbent in that district

release more water downstream in the coming days Phil Wilson is general manager of the lower Colorado River authority\nYou know a guns gun has a Damascus steel if anyone knows what that is is is really sophisticated stuff\nUm and but I think that this uh John ... of metal work was somewhat foreign to him a art for art's sake or I think he describes it as\nUm you know everything that he's done has had a purpose you know whether it's driving or or whether it's shooting a or whether it's you know cutting something you mix knives I'm ... and so I think wrapping his head around this new kind of\nAdventure was a challenge in some ways\nAnd so there are some fascinating dynamics that the film reveals here first of all Jesse James is I'm certainly known as an intense person with\nA great drive he creates fascinating stuff and have you guys mentioned he's a fan of Albert Paley so you have someone who kind of came of age as a fan of this guy now they're working together but there's some pressure as a result of that isn't there some\nYeah I think so I mean I'm you know\nI think that Jesse would credit Albert to some extent with inspiring him to take this path in life\nAnd Jesse has gone incredibly far and been incredibly successful in so much of what he ... he does um\nYou know I think that there's just a really interesting dynamic that you'll see between ah their work uh what albertson's to Jesse Jesse sensed Albert and and how they respond to that um you can see how they they sort of play off of each other and and where there is some ... drama\nWas there a time limit they had what are the rules um and sort of the regulations on what they had to do with\nThese they had somewhat of a uh some parameters but not many of the big one was really hyped\nYou know um they want it to keep it within a certain\nUh you know size and so they they came up with eight feet as the as the total Hi I'm but really other than that that's all they kind of set on each other there was a time we were looking at you know just under a year I think for\nThe journey but uh um they could use any medals they wanted they could use any of that uh you know technologies that they wanted they create what they want as long as they kept it within a fee\nAnd uh and that was the thing I think with Albert ... you know the flip side of\nYou know he was definitely more in his element creating a metal sculpture by his I don't think he's ever\nBeen given one that's already been started\nAnd then you know told to finish and that was his challenge even though he was more in his element\nWorking on top of something that's already been started\nUm and then that that you know you get to see how he tries to digest that um you know ... you see him take multiple paths trying to figure out what's the right way and his mind to fully see this sculpture to an end to to be fully realized and and that's a fascinating part of this also\nTalking to Todd McCammon and Tom DeLay the producers of dialogue in metal and in a few minutes you're going to hear pay Leon James join us but uh as Todd says here this is like the extreme example of something that to some degree probably everybody has experience having to park\nAnd give up control of something a project or working on at work something where you know you've got a lot of ownership and and a lot of passion on but somebody else is going to pick it up and run with it and you guys do that all the time you work with each other sometimes the editing gets done by somebody else or I'm ... and you gotta let it go a little bit but this is extreme\nAnd I wonder Tom we'll start with you on her both of you because you know toddlers with Albert a lot more I think Tom was down there with Jesse James\nWere you nervous at all that they may not like they respect each other so much and you can see that and it's really cool to see that in the interviews were you worried that they may not kind of dig it like you know either what they were sent or the final product of course\nI mean I think that uh there was that I don't I don't want to say fear but that sort of underlining I'm kind of emotion to all of this you know what what are they going to think you know ah I I think as artists they each tried to focus on President they I think\nIt's fair to say that that Albert was and Jesse both were focused on what was right in front of them in that moment and less about\nYou know what what are what's the other person doing or what are they going to do or a or ... ... there were many nerves I don't think about what are they about to send me I think they they both really tried to keep it in in the moment which I think it comes through\n... how did you feel about the ... were you sort of nervousness when Albert was going to see\nYeah I I mean for everything you said earlier as far as like you know seeing I was nervous for Jesse because Jesse was going to putting his hands on and Albert Paley sculpture even though it wasn't considered finished but it's still Albert started it and I think there was a lot\nI'm sure Jesse was feeling to be I Can't believe I'm working on top of an Albert Haley and the other side of it was Albert never worked on top of somebody else's work and and Jesse sent to ... you know in in the documentary we'll see what Jesse sent in ...\nNow has to wrap his head around how how do I see this finishing 'cause that was the spirit of of the of the collaboration not\nLet me finish it the way I think Jesse would want or um you know I Need to I Need to look at this and understand how I think now it he he started it I Need to finish it and and that was for for Albert that was definitely I think a different way of thinking\nAnd I before we close the interview on ask both of you what you think we learn from this ah one of my takeaways having watched a documentary now is that um [noise] to the credit of both Jesse James and Albert Paley they did not pick up the other's work halfway\nLike that couldn't I couldn't sleep I didn't know what to do\nFurther was those adjust station period that's for sure yeah [laughter] now you're you know the whole the whole process the whole process is\nOne of of transformation and are you there are certain skills or certain technical things that you do but it's how do you bring your own sensibility your own identity to that\nOr you had mentioned the aspect of functional autism a so just the weather is dealing with the you know what the motorcycle dealing with the guns but um if you look at a a musician for instance uh\nThe it's non literal you're dealing with sound you're dealing with composition you're dealing with an emotional context and that's the communication aspect\nAnd um so that's very much very much part of that I mean a poet uses a uses words and words have identity but there's the transformation aspect you put it into a different context\nAnd the many ways the way Justin I uh uh in a related or something like a collage situation that you take something out of context and you put it together in a different way and um you know where to dresses those are those sensibilities and that's very much a very much a part of that um\nI mean sculpture is a as if it can be lower rates of visual ... the cab you Larry it uh\nIt deals in space that deals with the invisible nature of gravity a balance of proportion and interaction and what's it like when somebody walks up to where does it overpowering or is it does a crate intimacy or whatever that might be and a very much engages I'm\nA human perception and ah the aspect of of humanity in articulate set and um\nAnd whatever a categorization is given to those uh those forms are really doesn't make any difference with the um it's the viewer that responds to um to that experience\nI I'd like to I'd like to ask both of you about the concept of finishing someone else's work and I want to take it back to a conversation that Albert and I were having before the program began in um if if I might have I Would ask Albert to share their listeners when he was expressing to me because\nIt was back in March with a W aspects I traveled club that I was in Barcelona and we went to the ... Familia which is of course Gowdy is great unfinished work that is now on track to be done around twenty twenty six but you know if you if you don't know the story guarantee gets hit by a streetcar and dies\nAnd you know he's got this this is just really wild imaginative\nCathedral that isn't process but at the good news was his plans still existed in so other people can pick up his plans and continue that work then the Spanish civil war happened and as it was explained to us in Barcelona this year\nThey burned just plants and from then it was sort of the gas as to what ... really wanted to do to finish this thing and so now they've raised a lot more money there's a lot more that's come in and they've thought okay\nWe cannot emulate a great artist you can't figure out and get him ... his head he's dead they're pissed plans are gone we're going to hire artist and they're going to finish it but they're going to do it in their own way and it's going to be obviously different so when you go there and you start to see what they've done it's different it's obvious it's like if if Jesse James we're building a motorcycle\nAnd somebody else picked it up and finished it and it was clear what part was Jesse James what part wasn't or if Albert Paley was doing something and then someone else had to finish it and it was obvious but they made that choice on purpose Albert because they thought we can't try to mimic guarantee you can't try to mimic greatness\nAnd you had an interesting thought about that I was like you to pick it up from there\nWell it's nothing different or whatever every um urban center deals with you have a historic sitters city center that in a town\nAnd uh you know a building is torn down for whatever reasons is not functional it's not practical something else happens so you're changing the whole context of that city you know how do you preserve history how do you engage with history um\nSo it it's a very complex very complex situation or specifically with Gowdy um there was an architect prior to ... started the foundation and started all of that and Gowdy basically scrapped all of those ... plans and buddy use the foundation pad and started up and um\nSo it's it's a matter of debate whether you are whether you try to emulate the style or not um\nHow would you have done it if you were in charge of that project and you had to figure out how we're going to go forward and finish this thing\nWell first of all even though during the Spanish civil war all of his drawings and uh we're we're a lost or the model still existed for some of it\nAnd um [noise]\nI don't know 'cause I actually I was at the site about a forty years ago when I saw it and now I've seen that a lot of the other things and to me it seems very I'm very very disparate the the ones I Would have left without a head down and just maybe had a clear glass construction around that or something like that and\nYou know function something like a ruin\nInteresting left largely unfinished show okay but but what do you have seen\nIn this kind of feels off putting a little disjointed\nMost of you know it's different for one thing with ... with most architects there's a sense of unity there is a sensibility is throughout the fabric of the building and whether it's a the stained glass windows of the carvings or of the interior spaces whatever that might be\nAnd I'm just gets very disjointed but I think that's the same thing can actually when you when you look at a contemporary city you have an old building next to a new building you have a ... a a pocket park or whatever that might be and it just kind of evolved over time and it's more of a um\nA study in the sociology more than ...\n... I I think that's a that's a great point up so Jesse when you\nAre going to be receiving Albert's half finished sculpture are you thinking you know I'm I'm going to see where he's going and I'm going to maybe try to follow it to some degree but I still got to do I've got to be me I've got to do the work I'm doing ... you know ... kind of take me through your your thought process there\nAre I kind of wanted to like go in the same direction he was going and like by and do it in a discipline that and I'm\nOne of the few people in the world that can do you know which is like a real free form like copper Smith show and and\nYou know I actually like cut some stuff off of his and I felt really bad at like ... being something really bad [laughter] Albert not so much [laughter]\nIf I mean if Albert cut into your is he didn't have the same bad feeling\nI don't think he did I mean he ... he might of for a little bit but not not so much [laughter] [noise]\nWhat I did I Know what I did send the early when I sent the sculpture to Jesse I ... I had I titled letters to that and I said a here it is Jesse do whatever you want with it [laughter] so uh I was given you free rein [laughter]\nOut but it's also like he already had some pretty good\nLines going in some good forms and I just kind of wanted to compliment that and like you know I don't know I think there's a\nA\nI don't know what how I Would say it like like I really respect Albert's work and like saw what he was doing and they just wanted to add my sprinkle a little sugar on it you know like make it even better so\nThat that's kinda cool yeah and that\nThe pieces if if if our listeners are wondering obviously there are two pieces and um I I suppose anybody who's got a chance to gun purchase on the bench surely but when that happened to I don't exactly know the timing in the process but I think if I'm the goal is is\nTo to help fund a number of important causes and Jesse and we're talking to Jesse James number Paley Jesse I Do want to ask you about something that you brought up in the documentary\nWhich is that you think it's important that we can continue to put the focus and the emphasis and some of the funding and making sure that there is education for mental skills jobs but the trades and uh I Know that there's that's a passion for you tell me about that\n[noise] well I think people like it's I don't know I work with a lot of kids and taught a lot of kids had a welding fab skills and stuff like that and there's just a\nHuge chunk of kids teenagers\nAdults in this country that have no plans to go to college and they do and there's also this huge\nA influx of vets returning home and that you know everybody's trying to find you know dictating to them what they're supposed to do you know you need to go get a degree and become like a mark\nVP of marketing or a graphic designer and that's how you're going to make it in life and it's just it's just a mess its ally you know like\nThere's a shortage of welders you know and like I think you know welder like a like a camp welder at for oil and gas pipeline welder down there in Texas can make a hundred and fifty to two hundred grand a year and work like four or five days a week\nYou know and like they just made the skills than from them for the most part my experience with for profit like trade schools schools that charge money to teach kids", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "city": "Rochester", "day": "18"}
