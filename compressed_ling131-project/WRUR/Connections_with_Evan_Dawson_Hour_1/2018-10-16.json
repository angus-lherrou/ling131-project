Dawson and this is connections\nRunning for another winter when you're in you're the Ford of Rochester is largely undeveloped and residents are wondering if anything is going to happen there well the city of Rochester putting out a new RSP centrally\nStarting over a chance to re imagine what might happen to support in an area near they want year round activity but for years there's been debate should it be commercially developed more there'll be more ... more parks just about a year ago\nA shred which was a big community planning brought a lot of ideas to skate parks to other kinds parse through high rise buildings to green space [noise]\nThis time the city of Rochester is hoping nailed down a long term plans or what\nShould or should not we'll discuss it coming up [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh us secretary of state Mike Pompeo is on a delicate diplomatic mission and Saudi Arabia he is attempting to press the kingdom a U.S ally in the middle east to explain what happened to journalist or ...\nIn public though Pompeo has been all smiles as NPR's Michele ... reports\nIt seems like a normal trip by a secretary of state is Saudi Arabia a key regional partner for the U.S hope you'll come up so [noise]\nBut ... is here for one main reason to find out what happened\nTo a Washington Post columnist and critic of the royal family ... who is believed to have been killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul this month the Saudis initially said he left the ... but now appear to be changing their story Michele ... NPR News Riyadh\nFlorida's Mexico beach is barely hanging on it's been six days since hurricane Michael's struck the panhandle with ferocious one hundred fifty five miles per hour winds\nIt laid ways to numerous homes and businesses in the Gulf Coast town of about a thousand people today hurricane survivors are combing through they're scattered belongings some things can be salvaged others are ruined\nBut these are things local authorities are most concerned about making sure that people have water food shelter well Mexico beach embarked on the painstaking task of rebuilding NPR's Quil Lawrence has more\nThere are Eighteen shelters in Florida alone and hundreds of people are still living in those others are having to start finding contractors or get insurance claims filed or trying to get help from\nFrom FEMA trying to get their roofs covered up with ... so that if it rains it will cause more damage than what already happened in the storm\nThat's NPR's Quil Lawrence the hurricane is responsible for at least Seventeen deaths in four states [noise]\nUh in sharing information and and trying to make sure that everybody understands what the goals are and the goals are really to get a first of all the community working together but also to educate the community about good development or strategies and to also to help to communicate some of the goals at the city had so\nUh I think we've made a a great step forward\nDavid this is where a development whether it is a partial five whether it is\nAnother city parts of whether it's waterfront development you will never have everybody agree there will always be someone who says how dare you build that they are or how dare you put this green space there when you could develop it\nUp so you know that going in what's the best kind of process that that you can envision to make sure what is decided is going to be the best to serve I guess the most how do we come to that conclusion knowing that there will always be someone who's on happy\nI think the process that the neighborhood in the city has tried to follow with a ... on the front end of this new or he is is pretty ideal I think you know the ... there's a twenty or history to trying to develop this I and I think the city would point out that it's an awful\nLot of public outrage over the years but I think nonetheless by the time\nThe last project came around a lot of people felt in the neighborhood but that didn't reflect what they wanted or or that they didn't feel consulted in spite of those previous years of of effort because I I think a lot of it felt like Asian history\nSo I think putting the input process at the front end rather than at the back and putting out a proposal and asking people to respond to it helping the community kind of coalesce around what they actually want to see on the front end of reacting to a proposal is as great as often as you can do that\nYeah and and so let me just grabbing early phone called a sort of give an example of the the wide range of ideas that are out there Jim and around the court wants to see what what do you want to see their gym\nAn aquarium and aquarium so tell us about\nAn aquarium at if I didn't call in today my brother would kill me because\nI've been here for years but\nThat was that's the idea that like of all the ideas I've got to me that's my last one and he gets married so anyway but I heard you guys talking about this I had to call and\nYeah I'm an aquarium of really large beautiful core and that gives you something that's the focal point the kids are magnets for nature and it's an educational focal point that checks every bucks and I can't imagine how anyone could be against it\nHow how big are we talking here well I picked him up to showcase everything in the lake and the surrounding a everything that's surrounding it and all of this\nThis whole natural area and that as a reflection of the natural habitat so I mean obviously the Lakers a focal point in the aquarium but I think it's also just it's an educational tool so something like an extension of the museum of the zoo\nAnd again another city where this exist that you would point to to say do that or is there sort of an analog somewhere\nI have no idea\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nI just know I Do I tell you what here's here's why a lot of what I say as a standard ... wife it would work if you go to our best pro shops ... there was constantly kids going up to that aquarium that they have out there and it's not even a bird was just a small but I can imagine well maybe\nFour to five times the size of the you know you know you've got kids\nAbsolutely enthralled by everything that they could look it up close and I think that ultimately becomes the focal point though you're traction oh it's just that I Do\nOkay I appreciate the Jimmy ... first out of the gay thanks for the phone call I appreciate that uh that Jim and around the ... and I'm a ... million Somali Clifford there's one example I'm sure somebody at the shore of the year ago raised a similar idea [noise]\nUm and so why don't we will will take gyms idea specifically and then we'll sort of brought it out there so aquarium we can see an aquarium there [noise]\nUm I don't think any time in the very near future but you're right it is an idea that gets brought up a lot and I love the idea I that would be fantastic\nUm we obviously would have to have a partner and whether it's the county via the zoo or that museum um or a local university we we need to have some partnerships there in order for that to happen it's it's a tremendous expense um but it's not something that can't be done it's just probably not going to be the first thing that gets done\nOkay Maria a interestingly enough I'm Kim white when she was here speaking about the redevelopment in Chattanooga, Tennessee\nThey originally started the whole um process with such a community ... in student throughout the idea of an aquarium which has become one of their most successful\nUm signature projects\nUm so the idea might seem a little bit farfetched but there is some some basis at the shredded was identified that the Sherlock community wanting to identify itself is a marine community so this would be part of that branding um and there is an opportunity for for research and education to also be a component\nThe nearest aquarium I Believe is there's Boston Toronto\nAnd uh Chicago so there are certainly geographically seems like it could feel a need\nI think the city wants to get our being by what January end of January yeah by the end of January and then my what's the process likely to be how fast after that do you think [noise]\nUm so that's a good question I mean there is an RSP committee um made up of city staff or I don't know that they plan on bringing in others but to review the proposals and then make recommendations I Would imagine for them to do due diligence that will take at least a couple of months\nUm before they put a proposal out there for the community to comment on\nIf we're sitting here one year from today should we have a really good you know sort of ball rolling down the road and on what's happening there I Would hope so okay and so David rally if if if the idea is that this really is one of the underutilized parts of of our city\nWhen you say underutilized I I don't know if you are if do you have a specific vision in your own mind or are you thinking as someone who is now working I'm In the sphere that year and it's not up to you it's up to the community but something has to happen there yeah more the latter\nI I don't have a sort of specific a plan and in my head at its just\nFor residents it's a challenge and that there is essentially one way in and out of Charlotte and I'm not exactly true but you know like am and he was certainly a major corridor um and so a lot of discussion about how do we get people around without it causing issues for the people who live there\nUm so yeah that was a major focus of the of the ... yeah engine\nSpeaking about underutilized resources or assets um the the effects tracks currently pose a a huge\nUm barrier for many people in the community to be able to reverse that tracks and and to create opportunities for development\nAh and I know it's a it's a big lift but the tracks exist so is there a possibility and your dreams gaping down the road that we could have a light rail system that would take people through the community on those tracks and all of a sudden turn that into an amazing resource an asset\nWell I I'm sort of a booster for for Rochester I mean I'm I'm a journalist I have no problem saying that there are certain some stories you want to succeed everybody wants to see what ever develop their\nWork and just building on David point I was there two summers ago with a four year old who literally thought it was the ocean you know just the look at the beach and the picture you taking my my brother lives near the ocean in Florida and I sent him pictures and he said where did you guys go this weekend I said I don't know three miles from my house\nUm it's amazing it's really an amazing place and yet most people have not been there\nI think I've been from the east side suburbs to that beach in Eighteen minutes before you got to got to make some whites but you can do it and so um there are a lot of sort of reputational things that are not deserved but I Want to continue to hear from the community so let me re appeal appeal to you no matter where you are first of all if you're in a lot I Want to hear from you this hour second of all if you\nIf you haven't been there for you think that well I Would go there if they had X\nYeah and so I think ... council member Clifford when we think about this was a two point eight occurs\nThat there's a lot of different things that could happen there and as David says whatever are crammed filled\nYou know mental box of ideas as it's not all going to be in the same place but if it's successful we'll see I think other development come up along and it's probably worth going back a little and having to remind listeners that there was a pretty contentious debate about\nUm high rise about that idea of hotel her condominiums\nThat I can you remind us what we looked at down there sort of why it went off the rails and and if there was demand for hotel usage their condominiums what do you think\nUm so the previous project you know I I Do think that the major problem that people had with that was that it was a ten storey building and it was a combination of residential and then there was a hotel component as well um and you know pretty\nHigh end housing which you know some people had some concerns about um whether or not there really was a market for that um and I think a very important thing was it was before the marina project was completed and it and the marina was really just getting underway\nAnd so it's a whole new ballgame now I think we really have to remind people that have you if you have not been down to see that marina you should it's a whole different place\nUm they have done a wonderful job they have brought more people are there are new businesses opening at the port\nUm it's it's really an exciting place so um I think similarly if we have another development that fits in on this parcel a according to this plan\nUm again we will just see it grow and grow I think David's right it's going to be incremental um but you know that's the way it should be happening right as maybe we can take a little bit of time and see how things go and you know see what really takes on\nUm excitement there I Will say that the boating community which I think people had talked about but you know people aren't voters they don't really realize that there is a voting community and they do\nGo around the great lakes and stop and visit and want and you know participate in the local ... a night life for whatever activity is down there\nSo you know we've brought in people just based on the Marino so you know it's really it's been a great experience so far so hopefully we'll continue that\nI don't want to ask all three of us in Studio to speak for the entire community because again there's a lot of diverse views and the community and I should mention we reached out to the Sherlock community association or read a statement from them in a second 'cause they couldn't joined us today but do you all get the sense that a high rise in that spot is sort of off the table because of what happened or could we see that again\n[laughter] well it in the ... I was surprised that some people um we're willing to talk about the high rise and they were willing to accept something that was a a higher\nA rise building but not in that location so they were more willing to have the high rises be closer to a south of there\nUm as a way that wouldn't disrupt the view sheds and and uh so so they really basically kind of relocated the high rise to bump into another part of Sherlock um which is a possibility but I don't know that the city controls that land so that's the issue okay councilmember Clifford\nRight I I think there is very little support for a high rise project I certainly hope that we get other submissions that don't include something that big\nUm again we can't really control what comes in what we can control is what we choose um and you know obviously it's something that has to be a successful project for the developer as well as the community so you know we'll see Rick David Rohde\nYeah I I think you would find pretty widespread resistance to something that is perceived us too tall I think you might find more of a mix of opinion about how dense besides a densely developed it is uh that doesn't need to necessarily mean ten stories but um\nI I think there are some mixed views are and I think that gets to work councilman Clifford mentioned in terms of what will work for a developer to actually be able you know this is going to be a private project something that largely pencil out how does it has to be to do that\nIn fact one of the things that I wanted to say about the ... process is that it really educated our residents in our community members about you know what some of the challenges are and I think\nUm unfortunately the way that the first project developed there wasn't an opportunity for people to really understand you know what goes into a project like this or really what goes on to that in urban development so it was a great opportunity from all perspectives to learn more about urban design\nAnd what works and why do you build closer to the sidewalk\nAnd people were really receptive to that so I think the hardening of positions that came in maybe the last time around I I don't see that happening again this time I think there is a much greater understanding\nOf really the the benefits and some of the drawbacks of a variety of different design and and different economic development proposals\nWell there is on November eighth so coming up next month November a three thirty PM at city hall council chambers a public meeting city staff are going to be available\nUm to provide clarification on the requirements therapy respond to questions proposals are do by the end of January so um this public meeting may help what else can we expect a Mali to make sure that this is trends parent and the community does feel involved\nWell one thing I Know for sure is that the Sherlock community association is a very committed to staying active and staying\nA really abreast of what's going on and letting people know what's going on\nAnd and I believe that the city staff of wants to have an open and transparent process um so\nYou know during the R S P process itself that's kind of a closed um process only because you know other developers are proposing things and they don't want the details of their proposals to get out and you know or some confidential stuff there\nBut once the um proposal is chosen then there will be I Hope plenty of opportunity for the community to respond\nWhen they read the statement that we got from the ... community association quote beginning with the shredded in two thousand Seventeen a diverse team of Sherlock community members and stakeholders crafted a comprehensive vision plan for the port of Rochester and surrounding area and his anxious to work with developers to bring the vision to life\nThe community is unified behind division and looks forward to working with developers and supporting future development opportunities that are profitable realistic and bring a year round environmentally friendly opportunities to the area of\nThe show up community association ink is invested in this process and invite all our members to attend the upcoming RSP information meeting and quote and again Mr member eighth three thirty PM\nAt city hall but I Would say ... ... the throne transition but but there is something that I think is important is the city has already made clear I think tax revenues go to matter to the city and that to me harkens back to the partial five to eight different piece of land different ideas\nBut this notion of green space the we are not a park\nA visionary square I think is what they called it didn't get as much traction I think is the the the people behind that proposal wanted because some of the power players involved doubted that they could really produce much revenue much tax return how important is that going to be for the city really\n[noise] I mean I Do think that tax revenue is important absolutely and I think that the residents understand that that's a factor so I think the days of we just want it to stay as it is a an empty really horrible parking lot or over\nSo you know huge step right there um and you know obviously there's plenty of green space around there and we don't want to interfere with it but you know it's just it's a very different community Charlotte has a different place so um [noise]\nI I think tax revenue absolutely important um but I I I Believe that people don't think that it's the only thing that that would be the mayor and the administration\nCamera do you want to weigh in on them\n[noise] yeah there there's a a great opportunity or one of the things we see is that Parcells or looked at it individually and one of the things I think the ... did and one of things that we really advocate for is to look at things more holistically so we we took a zoomed up view and tried to look at all the resources and identify different things and I I think that um [noise]\nI mean is now that he's had the opportunity to do something that private developers often cannot which is to look at what really provides a community benefit\nThat may not necessarily be totally profitable but that can be supported by the community so this idea of aquarium again is far fetched but as a possibility might not be a a a huge score as a profit making Endeavour [noise] um but it could be the kind of thing that I mean this pill that he could support and helped launch\nUm you know obviously keeping in mind that a lot of good things have to be set in place and grow with time I we we have this perception that everything has to happen in a really short time frame and that's not really the the basis for good design or good community building\nDavid rally when I think about the kinds of debate we heard it parcel five and I think about the kind of debate that we'll probably see continuing at the port in ... until something has chosen\nIt seems that there is I'm a little bit of descendants and I'm curious to know what you make of this debate over what really does generate tax revenue now obviously a big development big retail outlet et cetera that bustling et cetera another yeast few mall if you could replicate it and make it successful that kind of thing creates tax revenue\nBarry fair I think Britain home leasing is a great example with that you spend dental dispenser in projects like those a cornerstone group and Joe Santa um we've had some some great partners\nAnd I mean to single just a one person that he better 'cause I'm sure there are others but I'm a ... All right so back to your phone calls rich in Greece we've got to keep it tight now we're running out of time\nFrom an HD Geneva W which which are you from each due to Rochester and W. to know the HGH Webster [noise]\n\n\nFrom W exercise ... Dawson uh this is connection\nThere has been a push mill your trend when it comes to American troops in the war in Afghanistan [noise] presidential contenders will say that when you pull back\nIt was the campaign disclosure the election they they start hedging [noise] and then in office they say we need to double down on them and that's what the Trump Administration have done [noise]\nDepending on

it's very disturbing NPR's Scott Horsley reports the deficit jumped by Seventeen percent last\nYear mostly because of the Republican tax cut in higher spending\nThe deficit ballooned to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars in the last twelve months a remarkable tired of reading for a country not mired in recession or widespread war\nThe increase stumps largely from tax cuts and hike in military spending but you know an interview with Bloomberg Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell blame the big entitlement programs Social Security Medicare and Medicaid\nThey've been a ... good taco entitlement changes but go popularity of low show programs hopefully phone border ...\nThe federal deficit is expected to grow to more than a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year Scott

radio has learned to assess reports the rivals will take the stage in San Antonio backed by significant fundraising dollars\n... campaign pulled in a hefty thirty eight point one million dollars during the third quarter that's nearly three times the amount Cruz's campaign reported over the same period and a record for any US Senate race\nDespite the Democratic challengers monetary upper hand polls put Cruz a head a recent Quinnipiac poll showed the incumbent with a nine point lead tonight's highly anticipated debate will cover domestic and foreign policy issues and it's scheduled to begin at eight pm central time\nOur support our infrastructure our presence could go away but is there a point at which you might say this is not working anymore this is not worth or does it not worth the cost and in lives and\nI you know I think the critics also have a point that we can we cannot sign a blank check essentially be not about forgiving blank checks in America with is not in a position at once used to be to give blank checks to nations like Afghanistan and and I think that is also um a responsibility on our side\nTo make sure that the Afghanistan or the people of Afghanistan and the Afghanistan establishment so to speak respects what we give and they make\nIncremental progress they have to get their act together the political class were not in the I I'm not going to debate of contest on local politics here but the ... the political class needs to get their act together\nAnd move forward on some of the progress that they have promised us to get things in order we we can support them only that much\nBut they also need to understand this and I think there is a fair amount of understanding among some of those political elites um\nTo get to where they need to get to to get their country unstable footing um so I think we need to see progress on those things and that's where the frustration for many of the critics on the Afghanistan policy a stems from and ... those ... those criticisms\nUm we need to see some of those um movement and I think the ... did the dark horse your pockets on which is continuously affected our progress in Afghanistan on the security situation\nAnd part of why we support the Trump strategy or I think it's in the right direction as it calls for heart action on Pakistan and it defines U.S Pakistan relationship at some level is on the prism of honest on and that's where I think we ought to see where we're seeing a we're we're hoping to see progress on Pakistan\nTo come back to Pakistan and just a second but want to remind our listeners who um who may be wondering as you say ... with with some female leadership and some some progress being made and remarkable waste in Afghanistan that we never would have seen\nUnder Taliban domination what is the state of the Taliban reports that Mullah Omar died in a in a a Pakistani hospital five years ago and you know what do we know about the state of an strength of the Taliban I think the Taliban you know a ton of on\nThe the Obama administration's mistake was we gave 'em a we give it time based approach for except in Afghanistan and that's being the fundamental criticism and Taliban went into hiding 'em and you know um they knew that they had to wait just a few years to wait the United states out and they could come back\nI think the Taliban are desperate networks that are not ... on on the that that are safe havens um inside Pakistan that it'd be harboring these Taliban's\nUm and there is a robust a supply of money um and infrastructure to the Taliban that have equip them to ... launched an offensive\nAgainst the Afghan a population and I I think I think so the problem and interesting into the Taliban as you're right they pointed out Mullah Omar I'm died in the Pakistani hospital five years ago with semi bin Laden was found in Gloucester ...\nUm so that's where we need to arrest um the ... we need to we are having Frank conversations we're having painful conversations\nAs well as difficult conversations with the Pakistanis say listen you know and we know part of the problem last year\nLet's let's find a way to work together because you're the Pakistanis always consistently argued that the adults would they've also being a victim of terrorism from the two thousand fourteen it that's when the um that's when it it ... it had them home and the\nUm there was a bombing where's the school children I'm killing of so many schoolchildren meant something so I think that is a recognition and um there was a new leadership in Pakistan that provides us the opportunity to confront these problems together\nYou wrote though in a in a recent article that the American president is inconsistent and sort of unpredictable and may say things in a moment that make you pull your hair out but then the next day shift let me just read a little bit about some of that now I Want to get your take on that you write that\nNew Delhi hasn't forgotten a phone call between Trump and the Y. Sharif calling him a\nFantastic leader of a fantastic country but it's quick to replace that memory with a more recent snub to Sharif in Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago where Trump referred to India and not to Pakistan as a victim of radical terror unquote is there enough consistency and and frankly is there enough\nSort of\nIntelligence on the part of this president to feel like you can send a consistent message that you would trust look\nI'm you know Trump's consistency inconsistency so to speak as not only being on the India Pakistan issue it's been it's been uniform in a number of issues right\nUm so but but I think overall there is a recognition and I'm understanding in the U.S administration and the establishment than than I Am sure that gets to the president\nAbout um the the values of these various countries that offer it to the United states from the phone call to be deported the phone call but early on January ... this year\nUm there was a treat the New Year's gift to the Pakistanis was a ... from the president early in the morning\nSaying that Pakistan is taking billions of dollars from the United states and food and in ... and all the goddess lies and deceit and nothing so that that is is send that summarizes the mood of many officials that have dealt with Pakistan over the years\nIs it a case right now where the foreign policy establishment or where foreign governments are trying to ignore what our actual president says in dealing more with his emissary as other government leaders\nEight department et cetera I\nI think they try to deal with that and see because at the working level you know today a secretary Pompeo is in Riyadh or was in Riyadh writing that came out of working level they know I'm at secretary Pompeo Secretary Mattis and these are the officials that they have to deal with\n'em but you know the president is the president at the end of the day and you need to engage the president and unique to you know it does not mean that the president does not have a voice or to create more importantly at reading handled so they need to manage it they need to work with the president that's\nI'm I'm so what what is missing in all these things as you'd you would normally have assistants secretaries and deputy assistant secretary ... and ...\nDoing these jobs at a functional and that day today and an operational level and that's what's missing for many of these foreign governments an establishment yesterday you must have seen that report from the Chinese\nAmbassador to the U.S saying that we don't know who to deal with and that's a pretty telling statement I don't know if that was a politically manipulated statement with the current relations with\nChina that but\nUm but but you know you need these people to deal with and what happens is ... many times I'm the bureaucracy and these people are often interpreters and translators of the United states message\nFrom a political level to an operational level and when that is missing that costs us uncertainty and at times chaos and Trump's inconsistency adds to that chaos and uncertainty because um we're confused about what our policy is\nShort and some of the frustration in the first full year of the Trump Administration was a lack of filled posts for example and bachelor to India as as recently as well I I don't know when many of these posts fulfilled that you wrote in July of twenty Seventeen that would that postal unfilled it's felt\nAt the very least a bit of snow to take that country in that position seriously have we seen much moving\nYeah I mean like we don't you know I'm a ... at the in the region that I deal with David hale who was the ambassador to Pakistan has now become to become the undersecretary for political affairs in the Tillerson Tillerson era and the state department that was pretty um I think the morale is low\nUm the positions are largely unfilled and more importantly I understand that the effort made was pretty minimal are largely in the wrong direction to fill these positions\nBut I understand now Tillerson on them a secretary compares working twice as hard to ... we're seeing some of these nominations go forward\nOr we are seeing confirmation of the nomination still that does not it is knowing where where we should be\nAnd this is pretty through years into an administration and many I think including in Saudi Arabia\nI find my understanding serves correct today Saudi Arabia is one of ... in the middle east I don't think we have an ambassador in Saudi Arabia how can that be um ... what you may call it apathy um incompetence apathy or you know lack of a ... I Would blame it on\nUm you know it's like you're playing catch up you before you come into an administration you have marked 'em [noise] you have a map of these other postings and these are the right candidates and we need to interview them and their needs to be a structure and I think once that structure is destroyed or we didn't have the like\nYou know I'd asked to do with the broader um look at the whole Trump campaign officials who are\nCurrently under probe or investigation so these would be normally the theme that could be interviewing vetting candidates securing them for the jobs that they need to be secured and then put them into positions so now once that's a whole infrastructure is gone I think it's just you're playing catch\nYou mentioned David hale under new under secretary of state\nA wild speculation is the world becoming a more dangerous place\nYeah I think because you see as a um at somewhere I referred to this a statement that I made that the ... still considers the United states I said I like to flee honest neutral broker and let's get into the peace and stability and now and the basis for that is\nOn at some level we were we were we were there we were able to be trusted and ...\nAnd what what Cassidy refers to\nAs some of this trust comes from us being intellectually honest transparent 'em and relatively accurate and most of the situations where where we can and if we if we were not good at it is because of intelligence failures or whatsoever it was not della print\n'em so now you know if that's taken out of out of the ... and then what is left so that's where you come at a issue is like whether it be morally bankrupt that intellectually bankrupted we're looking to\nUm you know let things slide and not challenge some of these ... or um autocratic rulers\nBut some analysts have said look the world community is going to understand that if they are uncomfortable dealing with the United states as an honest broker right now this is one administration and the last four years in the last eight um and there will be sort of the pause and relationship it won't be irreparably harmed geez now I I\nDisagree with that because if you're being able to do this now you've set a precedent to do this again and they find a ruler on the other side\nAnd I'm looking at um I'm I'm looking at um you know saying America could do this what's the guarantee that America will not be able to do this again\nOn different leadership under different leadership for example take this case if you take this whole movement in case of nuclear disarmament right so we were promoting global zero and Obama's disarm and speech and everything\nAnd you know you got a momentum to its nuclear disarmament\nAnd now a ruler comes and says hey listen are threatening you with fire and fury next day I fall in love with you\nAnd if I'm somewhere and some part of the ... saying why would I give up my nukes because somebody might just that I didn't even fight and feeling again and perhaps he loves me because I did not give up my nukes and you could not frighten me with the could not go ahead with this problem is and now he wants to love me and find a way to seduce me to give up my new\nSo when you have this gain of inconsistency wide ranging spectrum in ...\nI think that's where the problem comes out\nSo there's a real risk to future relationships based on this administration even if everyone to regard in regards to the Trump Administration has gone there's a real risk there is a risk yeah how close are we to severing are losing some of those relationships\nUm you know we're so much embedded in the system there's so much wanted in the world I think there's going to be a lost a lot of open wounds that you know we we need to put put some alignment on so that's where I leave\nOkay let's get early break in the hour where to come back with Dr ... the director of the south Asia center at the Atlantic council in Washington just got into Rochester this afternoon he's a guest year of the world affairs council of Rochester making your presentation tonight but kind enough to join us for this hour right here on connections back with them next\nI'm Evan Johnson Wednesday I'm an ex connection a conversation about what's going on regarding charges brought by the FBI against assemblyman Joe Rico charges of bribery but confusion about who else might have been involved\nReporter Gary Craig from the Democrat and chronicle has worked with his colleagues to break that story over\nAnd it could be connected to other recent developments and allegations were going to talk about that Web stories with us\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from you our medicines highland hospital providing care to the Rochester community for one hundred and Thirty Years' highland offers a women's services total joined replacement geriatric care and other specialties learn more at highland hospital dot org\nA record number of openly el GB T.
