Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh funerals for the victims of the shooting at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh over the weekend or getting underway today NPR's Sarah McCammon reports from Pittsburgh the two youngest victims will be laid to rest after joint surface\nCecil in David Rosenthal were in their fifties and were attending a religious service when they were killed friends say the two who had intellectual disability found a supportive community at the tree of life synagogue rabbi Chuck diamond who once led the congregation remembers the brothers as a constant presence at services in study groups\nBut I'd give my study group at the end of the ... of ... book as a present and they were carried around with them wherever they are they're very proud of it they brought a lot of joy liberal full of laws and they really had a um presidents for community in general the Jewish community and they will be missed by by all of us\nServices for the rest of the victims will be held throughout the week Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\nAnd well some people say they would support a visit from President Trump others say just the opposite accusing him of fomenting messages of hate protesters are preparing for President Trump's visit to Pittsburgh\nThe president says he is considering in order to end the constitutional right to citizenship for babies born in the west to parents who are not us citizens\nNPR's Joel Rose reports Trump has tried to make his immigration crackdown the focus of next week's mid term elections\nTrump made the remarks in an interview with ...\nWith the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to and in\nFact more than thirty countries around the world offer birthright citizenship\nFourteenth amendment to the constitution guarantees the right to citizenship for all children born in the U.S when pressed on whether he can change that Trump says quote there saying I can do it just with an executive order unquote\nThe counties and and ah humidity is they're not taking that money and putting it in into other areas let's put it directly to property taxes that would be the key\nOkay so ... and we're talking what maybe Fifteen twenty billion dollars a year more than New York state would have to cover if this change happened is that right something like something like that okay so where we get a cut elsewhere how's New York state can handle that cost\n[noise] well that's that's the sixty four thousand dollar question right I mean you have to look at a you know what we're doing now a where can we find more efficiencies where can we find more transparency in what we're doing\nA for as an example of the governor now a ... about eight billion dollars a year in direct aid to uh companies in terms of either tax relief for a direct\nUm aid to two projects are in a you know to to retain businesses here in New York state\nUm you know I'd I'd like to take a good look at that I have great respect for the regional economic development councils and the people that serve on them or they work very hard\nUh but I don't think the governor's economic development plan has been a winter certainly not for upstate New York and so I think we need to take a look at that and let businesses get you know get out of the way of business is\nAlways been my thing you know I'll look at regulations cut some of the onerous regulations that they have to deal with day in and day out get out of the way and let businesses compete and let the way I don't think we're in the we're not in the process of creating jobs we should be in the process of creating an environment\nThat creates jobs for business or an economic development whether its workforce development retraining people things of that nature but you know eight billion dollars is a lot to do\nIt but it sounds like someone mark mall in our Owens Sheldon also\nRepublican county executives any candidate for governor say we've got to take back the cost of Medicaid to the state level that will help property taxes that will help county governments it doesn't sound like Republicans at the state level have a plan for how to cover the cost right now you you're not giving direct ... you're going to ideas but there's not a plan in place to do this tomorrow it doesn't sound like\nNo it's a it's a it's an idea it's it's a it's an idea worth pursuing and I think we're going to do that but you know you're not gonna do it overnight and you're not going to do it you know in a haphazard fashion you have to put a plan together\nHealthcare is our system working if you'd like to see at work\nYou know I think we have great healthcare um in our community um you know we have two great hospitals we have great um\nAncillary operations as well I was just over a trillion health earlier today and we're able to get them a grant or for them to be able to expand their services um services not the issue cost is always the issue when it comes to health care [noise]\nUm so you know I'm proud of what we've been able to do locally in the healthcare area\nUh but we need to you know figure out a way both nationally and on a state wide basis how we bring the cost down to me it's a matter of competition making certain that a healthcare services out there are competing for your dollars I'm making certain that um you know that that is the case\nSo and you mentioned truly ... used to cure it about a half million dollar grant for truly him a sense that's an organization that I'm In many ways has been a pillar for the algae cue community and in this country and had an email from a listener this morning who knew your coming on thing\nHad attended a form that you were at I think last week on health care locally maybe a couple of weeks ago now and I'm the listener was was making some claims about your thoughts about algae BQ community I was not the forum so let me just ask you the listener want to know about your views on transgender Americans I don't want to speak for you let's just start broadly speaking\nUm what what are your views on what the Trump Administration has said about transgender Americans in that\nA biology is sex is gender and that that there simply is no such thing as transgender the Trump Administration says how do you feel about it\nWell first of all when it when it comes to all of that in our in our state or the governor has passed executive orders are to make certain that there that is effective law that uh people are not discriminated against and housing a circumstance is not discriminated against and their jobs this is an executive order\nOr so people when they talk about the gender or legislation\nAre so much of that is is unnecessary now because the governor has effectively put this into place\nI think the only problem and I've always said to everybody everybody deserves your ... your respect all God's Children as far as I'm concerned\nThe only hang up that some people have is about the locker room issue on on gender um and so you know how comfortable would you feel\nI'm In a locker room setting if your kids were in a locker room setting if somebody came in who um you know was male and female locker room or a female in a in a male locker room\nHow would that make you feel as a parent and that's what a lot of people have a hang up about and how do we address that do you have to hang up above us certainly I'm concerned about that uh I think anybody you know who's a parent would and that's what I hear about in my for my constituents frankly I mean that's\nA lot of what we hear from them as well that that's an issue the bathroom setting is not as much of an inch issues ... it's more a locker on there and more open circumstance you know if you're in a bathroom stall you can go into right\nBut but you're saying this is an issue for for parents who are concerned about kids\nAbsolutely yeah I mean I had it as a parrot it it doesn't bother me it's not a concern that I have ... um but I I understand the point you're making and what you're hearing from your constituents\nUm so what is the solution and in your mind the solution would be if you have sort of physical biology that will tell you where you need to be in a wider\nHim in in my in my mind right now because the governor of the state of New York has issued an executive order there is no issue there is no issue these ... these circumstances have been taken care of school district\nYou can say we're joined by Andrew Cuomo 'em and certainly he's never come on this program would love to see him a but if I'm asked to Reno was the governor and Hillary Clinton where the president and governor has to Reno were saying look I'm concerned about what the Democrats are doing a Washington we've got to be a check on that here that would make sense to you\nKnow look at I don't like everything that you know what certainly what a President Trump says\nI'm you know I Wish there are times that he would say things differently is not the most eloquent speaker that you know the White House has ever seen\nUm you know he tweets a lot of things that maybe he shouldn't he ought to think twice about it but he is who he is he's a businessman in the White House you've never been a politician and there's a transition that ah is slowly occurring I think\nBut I always say to people you know you want to judge people on their personalities or you want to judge them on their progress and on their policy\nAnd on balance on the progress in the policy I support what's going on I like what's happening in the economy I like what's happening in my four oh one K.\nUm I like what's happening in a lot of different areas so\nUm yeah I'm In the end you know you want to talk about tax reform bill you know that the that the president put in place I think that's been a great thing for business certainly a more money is coming back into the United states more companies are staying here and not not going abroad um in in in my district\nYou know Ninety percent of the people in my district or making a better under the tax reform than than otherwise is the case\nSo you think so I think not just down the wealth and let me just say that you know absolutely not\nUm and the other thing is that I think that when it comes to New York state\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and killing our [noise]\nTonight at seven\nWelcome back to connections you just heard state senator rich funky and now it's state senator Joe Roebuck and studio squeezing ascend before the election I Know it's a busy calendar thanks for doing that\nIt's a good to have the opportunity to it it really is there's I think that's a good place to be there's a lot of good things going on there really is in Rochester just came from the opening of magic studios are eighty which when I say I'm state of the art\nI'm On digital film gaming R and D every platform um they're really going to be I think not only nationally but internationally known so in addition to\nMore students being good for them um you already have some spin off companies even in the development stage um who knows what could happen from that but I think it'll be jobs jobs jobs and that certainly was all boats so\nIt's so they say really I mean there's a lot of exciting things happening in downtown around town over some business park but again you know with the good there's always the challenges as well\nWell let's so let's talk about that with that I wanted to set you up for that well that that's very kind of you know what I what I Do well you know I Know you've served um a a number of terms in the New York state Senate and I have and and running for reelection I I Want to ask you first of all\nI'm how you view the political climate rich funky just that in this program that hates politics but he likes public service that he hates\nHow extreme rhetoric has gotten is an extreme or or do you understand the frustration that some people have\nWell I'm going to say a bunch of things\nI understand frustration\nBut those are issues that come from people I think would richest talking about is people who run for office and how the political parties can be both and how they flame the polar bears\nSo I always kind of I think made myself immune from that because certainly a humility you won't find anybody unless the running against you and then they\nAre untruthful and lie because they want to when I'm\nI reach across the aisle I'm Out there every day I think what is it allowed me to be there as long as I have is I have a very very different relationship\nWith this entire community white black Latino young old urban suburban you know I go to people's homes to help them fill out the heap form if they need heat help them get their um star rebate check\nIf need be and that's what I think rich me did I agree with that I like doing the job part\nI understand that there's a process and I respect greatly but the political part that goes above and beyond that I stay out of that fray as much as I can ... I'll I'll go to them it's like\nWe just got applauded by all righty I'm an everybody there del corporation everybody else for Joe I'm really and I and our delegation coming together working with the governor regional economic development council public private partnership to deliver resources which I Believe may be the\nEight corners might become a an oak here for us in employment it's a you know amazing how much that sector generates but you can't do that if you're over political I I don't run because\nHiding behind a party I run by what I Do performance not promised results and that rhetoric and I I Can't tell other people what to do\nBut I'm very very glad that I've done that and I'm very much rewarded by listening to my mother who said to be that way\nAnd the best reward isn't that only electoral victory but I like it when people say to me in the community even the other day I'm walking to the library was regular folks saying you know what thank you for doing this and this and this thank you for not doing\nThis and this and this too so I hear what you're saying I've never gotten caught up in that you might have the magic wand to make everybody tried to get to the middle I don't and all kidding aside\nPardon my decision not to run a national level and stay at the Senate is because I think I can have a bigger impact here and I liked that middle you can control it better so you're never going to run for another office\nI don't know if I'll ever run for another office but you know what I didn't want to it this time not that I was afraid um I wanted to keep balance in the state that was important to me in first and foremost but is a side bar\nI don't like 'em either polar being so nasty\nAt that the federal level and so I think least regionally here yeah we've not operate that way and the results have been good\nAnd it's great when we can sit down with the county executive was in one party the mayor was in another ... rich funky Harry Bronson it didn't really get the and we've got things done it's not that's not political that's factual\n... and that's how I think government should be and that's how I was taught\nWhen I was younger as well so um sometimes you can't control everything but you can lead by example um and even though we all get frustrated a little bit usually performance will prevail\nAll right so let me ask you a little bit about the polar stuff and in a moment you can tell me if the question is faring uh sure because yesterday on this program we were talking about the tragic events this past weekend in Pittsburgh and one of our guest is weak and norm or it's been a long time political commentator who's written books with Republicans he's a Democrat\nSays that there is polarity on both sides but it's not equal and it swept up by this administration and the rank and file Republicans especially in office at all levels\nAre two obedient to the top levels which right now are stirring up that kind of hysteria so I Want to ask you if you think it's fair to ask you about Trump and I want to ask you if you think that it it's out of ... do you think the rhetoric is dangerous is harmful\nWell I wouldn't choose to do it but when I'm going to say is no answer that I wasn't used to do it either job and I mean if you can I say that's you know so it's not that the questions unfair it's like that with everybody not just this guy\nSo I expect first and foremost to be judged by what I Do but clearly\nAnd that putting Rochester first not afraid to voice my opinion whether they're Democrats or Republicans I'm going to go back and say\nI was civil but made the request of the bomb own ministry ... you know we talk about health care poor people could you up the Medicaid reimbursement rate federal rate to us yeah like it was in some other states that would've helped us tremendously do a lot of things when the answer was no\nI continue to pursue that and try to build a coalition to do that or it's no different to me that is with this president you know\nSo on that issue of what's happening in polarization when we had the first shooting I was very glad that the Senate put together a very very logical package\nThat would've allowed in pay for a mental health professional and every high school which I think is a key no rational person should people they don't know and now knows they're either going to be perished themselves are being incarcerated for life or being a mental institution\nGive some money to make the facilities a little bit more secure with some simple things like that bolting doors and things like that as well as local option hitting a security resource officer a trained person much like they have in the city school district\nI thought that was a great response I did not agree with the president who thought we should be arming teachers and went publicly and said that so again the answer is\nYou have to do you think is right for your constituents I Believe in a professional way in a rational logical way\nI'm no matter what's going on in other levels of government above or below you and I I Would make this statement you know humility show me somebody in elected office who stood up more to the powers that be\nThat you're not into it right now I don't know why but I Am here so I don't get here say don't get I I asked you about President Trump and you talked about Medicaid reimbursement and what I Want to talk medicate talking about president I I'm with you one president is uniquely different wire\nRepublicans unable to say he is uniquely dangerous with what he's doing\nI don't when he says something I don't agree with I'm going to say it again okay this is why your framework is unfair okay not your question\nI'm going to stand up for what I think is best for Rochester is I'm not at that level of government\nI don't think it's my job to critique him everyday nor was it President Obama which some people didn't they said you're not there I Want to be judged and maximize and what I could do it my line your office in your level of ... okay and\nThat's been consistent that has not been with him but I Will say this because I think this is relevant to the question what is and again\nI hate to use as an example but all those costs now think those people are living\nAre going to be incurred that we're living to be the biggest growing numbers Ninety two hundred it ... the money has to come somewhere but it's going to go into health care ... so the good side is going to be more jobs in that area but we have to I think all work collaboratively and intelligently as to how we're going to pay for it and believe it\nNot kicking the can down the road I Would love a baseline for the federal government to go we're going to come every single person to this level and then if you want to go a little bit above and beyond then you can buy and I would be all for that but again I'm not running for Congress I'm running for the state\nLegislature I'm gonna try to sneak a couple of phone calls for the half hours up with state senator Joe robot Joel and bright and go ahead Joe\nHi thanks for taking my call her and I'm senator Roebuck and I'm outraged listening to you at your earlier comment earlier answer to Evans question about um how you feel about the the level of rhetoric\nI think it's a total cop out to say both sides are getting that your president right now\nThe leader of your party is using incendiary language every chance he get and we were at a very perilous time in our country right now it's up to actually it's up to local politicians like you\nI'm just a college professor I'm not in a position to talk to people your constituents and so on your you have a duty to talk to your constituents about what is it\nAnd I do and I do ... ... talk about things and I and I do I didn't\nHear it just now in your answer to to have and you are you're completely dodging the issue\nI don't well what I heard I'm I'm acutely aware of you I I heard someone who said I'm powerless I'm powerless to do anything about this so I didn't I didn't say was powerless now all our Joel I I've got I've\nGot to stay on that and respond Joe thank you go ahead Joe\nI you know what I don't want to see the wrong things I Try to be very honest and I'm very open is open\nApproachable as accessible as anybody and I know some people really don't like the president and they have the right to do that but it's absolutely ridiculous when I even give an example\nOf how I disagreed with the president instead of publicly when it was about an issue that might have some bearing on my level of government or my life\nIt is just there's a lot of politicians I disagree with is not my not unique to you as a politician this president no but I I've seen it before there's some people that\nDon't like Governor Cuomo but when I can work with them I work with them when I disagree I disagree and I don't get\nTrying to take an all important issues we get in these people are supporting my opponent they have the right to\nBecause they cannot work me because they can't help for for me not want to say somehow I'm responsible for somebody else I just I don't get it I'm going to say it again\nWhen the government when they said something about arming teachers I speak up when they say something about wanting to do something that's hurtful to New York financially I speak up\nAnd it's not new for me I've done that my whole career I think that the problem isn't their assessment\nBecause they don't like this guy so much\nThat somehow they think I have to be his rhetorical\nAnd is attacking is everybody else it's never been my style not afraid to disagree and I definitely did not say I'm powerless ... I've never said that my life normally ever hear of that come out of my mouth what I said is I Try to maximize what I can with purpose and I will continue to do\nThat last night I again I I think what Joel and the ... the critique is that he wants to hear you say this is this president is unique in our American history and is dangerous in a way that is unlike other politicians you see him like other politicians\nWorthy of calling out when you disagree otherwise not yeah because that's my job okay last question them because we're running out of time quickly about forty seconds or so for tonics in Rochester you in a lot of people have support from both sides of the aisle and it's been criticized and a lot of ways correct ... you can't do it in thirty seconds but I may ask you to try to let the public know where it stands feel about it\nSure so I have to say this for ... the regional economic development council public private partnerships we now have an eastern business park\nWe're down to Fifteen hundred coated jobs but over five thousand jobs of other companies are desperate foods hydroponic growing Columbia care medicinal marijuana um energy battery a lot of good things going on there it's been a success I\nWould say it this way regional economic council a more to go with her I think is a is an overzealous on what's happened so far but hopefully good things are yet to come\nOkay so you still have some optimism will see more jobs there I'm I'm praying every jobless every boat okay and because I only got about sixty miles on it you want to see legalize marijuana in the state would you vote yes or no recreational\nI was the first Republican vote for medical marijuana\nAnd lead the charge working with breast cancer coalition I'm certainly taken a look at this um but you know the medical society just came out with some cautionary notes so I I think we should look at that too so my books open still not afraid but should have some public dialogue\nState senator Joe robot running for reelection always good sir thank you for being back you up in All right I think the raw Britain engineer and Megan ... producer we've got more connections coming right up here stay with us [noise]\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views expressed do not necessarily represent those of this station\nStaff management or underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent of W ... is strictly prohibited\nConnections with Evan Dusten is available as a podcast just click on the connections link a double helix news dot org\nYou can make a lasting difference to the station that has given your years of outstanding programs a gifted W ... through your will trust or state plan is an easy way to sustain an organization that is important to you for more information about remembering W ... or will contact Kathy read it to five eight zero three one nine\n... film with plenty of charm the old man and the gun is new at the little starring Robert Redford insist these basic visit the little ... oh Archie for Showtime travelers pod cast\nMore this is double direct six I Am Rochester W.

Windsor Johnson reports Trump is proposing and birthright citizenship in the United states\nIn remarks to Axios news Trump says he'll end citizenship for children born to non citizen parents\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nAny such attempt to alter the constitution will be met with legal challenges Omar Jed lot of the American civil liberties union says it's just another attempt by Trump to increase division and the country\nIt's appalling that we have a president who's willing to shred not only the notion of unity shred basic constitutional rules\nThe right to US citizenship is granted to U.S born children under the fourteenth amendment Windsor Johnston NPR News Washington\nAnd I'm not sure I understand why the decision to focus on socio economic integration there are other impacts of racial segregation ... um such as the funding formula that's based on taxes and tax property\nOr because of white flight in our cities of the the worst of the properties in the city um are extremely less than they are in the suburbs impacting any formula is there are based on taxes to fund our schools\nAre there's force cereal displaced but has taken place over the decades\nUm and there's been a study that showed that over a six year period as communities around our schools are displaced through red lightning gentrification urban renewal et cetera that it disintegrates the community and the cohesion\nAnd studies have been shown that violence within those communities\nIncreases as a result of destroying the cohesion of the community and the first decades the community they know one another my kids are your kids and your kids are my kids in the next generation they don't know each other\nThe only authority figures that are giving any credit are older person's\nBy the next generation it's crazy nobody knows each other so the question that the study um poses\nI Know it's important to address gun violence but whose addressing the violence being created by force and hope displacement in the communities which are students are stupid it also another impact of segregation is that eighty five percent of the teaching staff is up a very different culture than the students\nSo that results in lowered expectations studies have shown that\nThat results in the over suspension of black and brown children that results in the over identification of black and brown children's special education so I'm trying to understand how these other impacts of a racial segregation\nHow they're not being addressed why they're not being focused on why would the state choose socio economic integration when we don't have a county wide system here in Rochester superintendent crane what do you make of it\n[noise] well um [noise] river mixed some great points and um [noise] I Know that the uh the times or the county wide concept of come up to bring a address some very negative fashion or in the past um again I\nI think we are it's incumbent upon each of us especially image occasion to wherever possible set up um experiences for kids\nAnd and deal with the issue of diversity in our teaching students uh we've just recently started the payoff wasted teaching program which is a dual credit course\nWhere uh although we only started out with seven students this year we hope to build up so that students within the district or are interested in becoming educators\nUm go to um sushi and misery of right now or are conducting a colleges and then come back and teach and all students were students of color are all students are eligible uh and uh we're recruiting across the board so that\nWe can in effect grow our own because our recruitment\nOr just those have been successful ah so this is a new program that again are dealing with the concept of diverse classrooms are beneficial for all kids wherever we consider those up we are two\nAnd a a teaching shift it looks like all of America is important for our kids to see as well\nI Want to read from your piece a little bit here and kind of explore the question of whether we should keep trying to integrate schools and their courage that the greater Rochester black agenda group\nHas questioned whether integration is realistic or even desirable for African Americans why Erica [noise]\nWell there has been um some push back on the very concept of the socio economic integration effort and and one member of that group said basically\nThat they considered offensive that to say that\nKids need to sit next to white kids in order to learn that poor kids need to be surrounded by rich kids in order to learn and that it is possible to have on education that works for a majority a low income class or for\nClassroom I mean we've seen historically we've seen I'm African American educational institutions that are very successful and entirely African American so you don't have to what they're some of the part of it is what they're saying is that you don't necessarily have to say that we need white so we need rich people to learn\nUm but I don't think that that is necessarily I don't I Know that's not what grade schools for all is saying I'm In ninth grade 'cause we're all is the organization that is\nTrying to push a socio economic integration in in the Rochester area and it's not saying that you need rich kids in order to learn but I mean the world is what it is and you have to say that a lot of\nLot of life is based on connections a lot of life is based on social networks lab in life is based on who you're around and if you are\nA child who um if you have a chance to be the friend of a kid whose\nMother is a doctor if you have a chance to be around a child who's mother or father is a and the president of the company or whatever something like that is just trying to expose kids to more things and it's not saying that\nPoor kids can't learn in all poor environments however\nUm as as someone in my article is quoted as saying the research is a research factor the fact that there is nowhere in the United states where you are seen as systemically systemic success in um where you have just hyper isolation and\nExtremely large concentrations of poverty just does it hasn't happened anywhere in the country and if if you know of similar any listeners please call me and tell me I Would love to look into this but I Am unaware of\nAnywhere in the country where they have found a systemic way to\nHave success in highly concentrated schools are you going to have one school that's doing it or to school they're doing well or this program here it is working great but on a system I basis no and you have when you see look at places like rally where only north Raleigh Raleigh North Carolina or Hartford, Connecticut or I'm going to ...\nWith what they've done is they haven't countywide system and they they try through administrators tactics to make sure that their concentration of poverty has not high you see very different results from what we have in Rochester\nWell in a moment I Want to turn it over to our listeners for phone calls emails you can email the program connections W excerpts either that or you can call toll free eight four four to nine five talk eight four four to nine five eight to five five or if you're calling from Rochester to six three to ... to six three nine nine nine four\nAnd I want to ask our listeners how important is an integrated schools to you what are you going to do about that what are you willing to do about that but let's close the loop at least a one point here and let me ask Reverend Davis\nDo you have any empathy for excuse me whatever members of our own community who might argue that this is the wrong path to pursue I Know we don't need integration do you have any sympathy for that for that argument what do you make of it\nI definitely do 'em before I respond to have one question the um\nThe studies that have shown that socio economic integration um exchanges isn't that based on county wide\nDistricts\nNot necessarily I mean they could if it could be a socio economically integrated school are socio economically integrated classroom so it's not entirely county way\nBut in in our particular situation um mathematically it's impossible within the district for us to create such we wouldn't need a county white system to be able to create that right at them as a superintendent crane has uplifted\nThat's been discussed in previous years and that's not been acceptable um as a way past as a\nPath for sure and it burned in school and just to point to point on that Ericka reference Raleigh North Carolina which my understanding is you go back to the mid seventies when they had\nSort of um this integration one integrated district but they at the time had one urban district and then one county wide district not twenty or so so that was it ... probably an easier political cell\nAnd in terms of getting this done it's I'm also looking for examples of places that have managed to well we have a new got Seventeen different school districts that would have to somehow combine I and I don't know any ... anywhere that's happened\nYeah so oh okay so so point taking but in terms of pursuing integration is is it all worthwhile effort\nI don't believe so based on the answers that we just looked at um I don't believe it's possible I don't think it's coming and then next year\nAnd it's urgent right now for the students that we have right now so I Believe that we need to actually address the students that we have right now address the systemic issues that are uplifted a moment ago that also are the result of racial segregation\nAnd addressing over suspension over identification um two alien culture is coming into contact\nWhat's happening in the neighborhood to disintegrate them and the funding formulas all those things\nUm would help to improve the schools that we have right now because based on the answers that we just discussed integration in the Rochester city school district is not going to happen anytime soon and spending money on piecemeal places were five or ten students\nUm meet meet one another I don't believe is a systemic solutions and that we need systemic solution and we need it now\nYeah that was that last one I mean I don't know I mean what are the incentives are Eric and Brian is there an answer for\nThe for example in the it's sticky it's it's very sticky because in the instance where they try to\nCreate a partnership between French road and school twelve the idea was at school twelve has a very popular bilingual program and they thought that perhaps frightened parents would be interested in sending their children to the bilingual programs called a lot at at school twelve\nBut then it would've been\nDifficult for them to give spots in that program to brighten children when there's a waiting list for Rochester city school district students to be\n... in that program so they that that was you know one of the main reasons that the talks broke down because it just didn't it wasn't going to be feasible to give spots to suburban students um and deny them to to Rochester city school district students and then\nHonestly that if you look at the test scores at ... I think the LA the English language arts reading exam scores were sixty sixty one percent passing in its school twelve it was somewhere in the vicinity of twelve percent ten percent passing so\nThe disparity in um test outcomes is is a major attraction for for a major reason why parents wouldn't\nNecessarily\nDecide to make that decision and I did it they didn't even get to the point where they even offered it\nSo ... and ... and they um they'll never kind of ... children from the high schools around the suburbs to go to Edison their way to Edison has and um [noise] excellent programs in terms of a technical skills and they've got the ... program and and things like that but it didn't but again the graduation rates do not\nUm compare to many of the surrounding suburban graduation rates superintendent right\nYeah um [noise] the Edison program of 'em\nAre just mentioned is something that we really try to adjust to suburban parents are about this through\nOur seventh and eighth grade school counselors or for the past two or three years now we've had um our school counselors from the junior high schools\nOr go to some take a look at the programs being offered talk with ah the professionals in the building and understand that is the seventh and eighth graders go through their counseling about their careers we wanted them to talk about the opportunity but was\nI'm offered to do this and they had the space there there wasn't a you know because the space for suburban students\nAnd uh what they would suburban parents needed to understand was that this program or a in conjunction with um she she would be able to allow their children to earn an associate's degree for no money\nIn five or six years if the kids and rolled in ninth grade were successful in ninth grade and stayed with a program through five or six years so there's an example of some incentive that I thought would get the attention of of suburban parents and ah although it is only a one\n[laughter] it is at least one a parent who I think is taking advantage of this next year I'm not sure that it's finalized\nAre but we have had parents taking some interest um and looking at vet outcome in spite of whatever they may think a prior to the discussion about medicine and Mrs\nYou want to go ahead go ahead Reverend Davis\nUm just to the caller I just wanted to give a challenge to reconsider the statement that integration has taken place I think that's something that you've made a state that integration is good and has occurred um for integration to have occurred that means\nEverything should be our public schools should be desegregated and I think the purpose of this session today is that we're learning across this country public education is very much still segregated [noise]\nSo I Would um challenge that integration ever actually took place in accord with the persons of the brown versus board of education thought it would take place\nAnd I would um challenge you to watch the eyes and the price series you can Google it on YouTube and you don't have even have to turn the sound on\nAnd look at the white resistance\nTo African Americans seeking just to have education like everyone else\nThat white resistance continues unto today and I'm so again I'm not sure where integration has actually taken place across this country\nBrian and it's going to say that I think as long as we are set up in this society where we make decisions on education based on our individual self interests and you're going to have this system\nAnd they're the ... if they do another round of this grand and try to find some way of enticing\nFamilies to\nYou know participate in voluntary of integration are voluntary desegregation involuntary socio economic integration\nI think that we're going to probably see the same sort of outcomes that we've seen because\nAs\nOne point two million dollar grants aren't going to fix the structural history and problems that have got into creating a system that we have in which\nYou have most of the poorest and people of color in the same school district and then surrounding that rings of suburban districts\nAnd then you see the disparities and outcomes and so to undo that is going to it's going to take way more than ... than advertising and\nYou know grant programs of this size is going to take an actual it would take a what I think the my favorite quote out of this article was that it will take a shift in the way we look at public education if we look in public education as an individual responsibility\nFor individual families to seek out the best situation for their particular child then we're going to have what we have and if we somehow are able to shift to a and system in which we try to look at the entire public good then I think that there might be some ways of of changing thing\nWell we've got a phone call from the airport with a parent who's calling in to explain why parents in the suburbs don't want to send their kids to city schools this is Robert and for a port go ahead Robert\nThanks for taking my call for the city schools are the worst performing big city schools in the entire state the the city school system in Rochester the city [noise]\nAh why why would somebody from the suburbs want to send their kids into that sacrifice their kids' education future uh to to prove some social justice point um I think one reason why the school system there is a failure is that you've got huge levels of absenteeism the DNC actually did an article on August\nThat found that uh thirty six percent of students in the district or were absent more than ten percent of the time they weren't role you got several school from the district that have fought over fifty percent of students absent chronically absent to one school\nVanguard had sixty three percent\nI Can't imagine the chaos in the classroom trying to teach teach kids when you got kids kind of cycling in and out and if you're a student is ah has perfect attendance uh he's got a teacher that's trying to to catch kids up the tab and chronically absent its its absolute chaos avoid it\nOK Reverend Davis you want to start\n[noise] um yes I I understand I'm as a character seared in her article that if you're coming from a school where your test scores are like sixty percent and the same um elementary schools fourteen percent in the in the district you know why would I sacrifice my child there\nAnd so again I'm looking at\nThe urgency is the kids who are already in the system who are already a part of the Rochester district and I believe our focus needs to move on making the best schools that we have right now for them\nI again I I Want to make sure I'm I'm hearing you correctly Reverend Davis so mhm\nYou want the emphasis weather is funding initiatives work to to target a district like Rochester city school district the ... and not try to force immigration not try to have this whatever kind of campaigns to convince parents like Robert and fair port have send your kids to city schools\nAs far as I understand Rochester is not going to become a county wide district so socio economic integration is based on a county wide system\nThat we don't have that here and so again I'm focusing in on the children that are here now and need resources now and we want to make the best schools we have now rather than to continue to pursue something that we don't even have the environment for we don't have a county wide system here\nOkay from the Democrat and chronicle our bronco have\nAnd that was a sentiment is a several people that I interviewed for the article is I don't really know that under the current conditions\nOne point two million dollars is not going to convince suburban parents in the K. twelve environment to send their children into the Rochester city school district but one point two million dollars will pay for\nAdditional teachers that will pay for additional resources it'll pay for teacher training it
