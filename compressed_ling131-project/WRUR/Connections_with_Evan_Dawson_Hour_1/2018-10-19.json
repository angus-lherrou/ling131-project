{"month": "10", "state": "NY", "station": "WRUR", "content": "That's what you want to hear and uh and I know Scott is only too happy to play for you so please a back that up with a pledge in any amount thanks to Richard and Brenda Villa case for matching your pledge when you call an eight hundred to nine to five nine nine nine for\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOkay\nNo no no no\nThey\n\n[noise]\nSupport for different radio comes from remembers him from little can farms and Madonna you fix the than it would be gone and extend through November for more than three hundred and fifty varieties available including\nBut even if someone who worked so hard on issues of equity a issues are related to the educational levels or she has the is about to get another new superintendent um is is that an inside baseball thing or do you think that ultimately that really matters\n[noise] well yes it definitely matters because every time we have this transition it slows down the work that's already happening to improve kids' lives in that district um and so\nI'm really I'm really worried about what's going to get done in the next six months you know how this is going to put a wrench and things and it always does\nBut I I Would zoom back and I would think about this even in the context of the election because what happens in Rochester city school district is greatly influenced by the state uh when it comes to funding and policy and so we we blame local leaders a lot for their missteps them and we should when when we when they do\nBut really it's a bigger story because three fourths of the money in the city school district comes from state dollars\nAnd right now we have a distinguish educator who's going to be releasing report very soon that's just an example of how the state um brings a heavy hand intervene in the direction of the district so who we who we elect to the state can have a big impact\nOn the district more generally but I Would like to see whoever comes and be there for five ten years not another two or three years then\nOr there's an event coming up on October thirtieth still coming together and Mary who's on ... from the league of women voters what do you tell us broadly what the goals are and then what kind of talk a little bit more specifically about what we can accomplish here\nThink seven the league of women voters take some uh presenting information to the public very seriously and and um our method for for accomplishing that is some candidate forums and information forums\nWe love to partner with groups like the children's agenda who bring important information to the table\nWe are looking to uh to present to the public information on candidates from the candidates on October thirtieth\nAt a seven PM at first a third press and um uh the racist that we're looking at are the uh ...\nAnd the way our debate or medical today is that what we're doing is we're\nWe're judging candidates based on their personal their personality in there for four and I think it is a little different than a job interview you're the only one on one with a person and their hair of time to explain or or or or or make a point\nAnd that there was a real issue with the way we do debate and I just get the comments on that we do and when you look at the cabinet here and we didn't even get into whether people were confident\nThat we're we're making our judgments based on for ... and ... were legal women voters and others do to change the way we do to create so that we don't get caught in the Trump\nCampaign scary Mary [noise] thanks scary um actually that's that's um that's a terrific concept um we've right now have trouble getting candidates to agree to the two minute per answer format um and and what I think that's too long\n[laughter] I'm I'm Serious I'm not sure whether it's ... yeah I I'm not going to presume there but um but should we should we managed to get better participation in in our current format\nI I think that uh believe would absolutely be interested in a expanding into other 'em more creative and more I'm more\nFlexible format you know we could certainly do an evening with however um federal law indicates that we have to have 'em both candidates president or were making a contribution to the one who shows up\nSo um so we're restricted in terms of of the way we the way we present candidate forums\nWe want to make sure that the counties are reimbursed for those costs um secondly just confusion around what um what does it mean ah in again down to like a law enforcement officer who doesn't understand that now is sixteen year old must have a parent present\nDuring an interrogation um that a child cannot be detained with an adult and the same facility so it's there's going to be a process of adjustment and we understand that but we want it to happen as quickly as effectively as possible\nDo you get the sense that politically this is not partisan and I'm not no I'm not just talking about raising the age I'm Talking about all the issues that you've written does this tend to split along partisan lines you certainly are not an organization that seeks to advocate politically at all these are issues based ideas mhm does this split along partisan was\nNot really I mean we have very strong um support for example Senator Mitch lucky was at a a a an early intervention a press conference that would help early this year and we have strong support from Harry Brunson and childcare and you know Joe robot has been a good friend to children you know so\nIt's it's not it's not particularly okay I've got an email from a listener named Richard ... says Evan let's be honest for once the ill informed voters the foundation of the American voting system well after our only break in the hour we're going to come back and talk about how the league of women voters views geo TV a little different though when you think about and get out the vote\nOr they care about get out the vote ... but not in the way that you might think an actually addresses the point that Richard emailer is making Ayman Scanlon is an education policy analyst for the children's agenda who is going to take us through some of the priorities that he sees\nWhen it comes to legislative issues and in particular what he thinks Boehner's ought to be considering as we kind of take a look it up and down the ballot before election day\nAnd you're just you're Bridget Hurley director of advocacy for the children's agenda so let's get our only break in the hour come back with them next on connections\n\nComing up in our second hour the story of serving Marshall the first African American Supreme Court just remarkable new show at ...\nBrings Thurgood to the stage and in fact there was only one person than the entire cast [noise] you're gonna meet him ... plays Thurgood Marshall in a powerhouse performance telling the story not only of Thurgood Marshall's life history of

David also wrote the book clean about addiction research China and\n\nNight at seven looking back to connections I met a doesn't want to let you know that for the next twenty five four minutes until one PM\nWe're still in the last day of our phone membership campaign and we are now just for twenty four minutes in a dollar for dollar match thanks do in Rochester couple who have been members since Nineteen eighty four\nMembers since Nineteen eighty four so connections listeners I'm appealing to you to call for five four sixty three hundred that fine line to make a contribution to make sure you're not only keeping public radio strong but if you care about having a local talk program that matters for five or sixty three hundred most\nNPR member stations don't have their own local talk\nNot anymore for five or sixty three hundred let's keep it strong and you can double your contribution for the next twenty four minutes thanks to a couple of Rochester couple of member since Nineteen eighty four\nFour or five or sixty three hundred or So Richard emailed the programming and wanted to say to the uninformed voters the foundation of the American voting system and before the program began Mary used on ... from the league of women voters was making your point about this very issue but ... and to you it relates to get out the vote in sort of a different way\nExplains it does um we feel that actually it's up to the parties to get out the vote it's up to us to see that that vote as an educated one in ... in a nonpartisan way which is the foundation of the league\nI'm not sure that I buy the idea that the uninformed voter is the ... cynical yes I think that cynical and I'm not sure how you support that in any way\nUm however I I Will tell you that there are um in our observation\nAn enormous number of issues rising to the fore in this particular election and and I'm In an increase in the number of folks who seemed to be paying attention to them I spoke this morning with a temper racy one of the two um commissioners at the Monroe County board of elections\nAnd uh and he gave me some numbers that that are just stunning\nOf he tells me that this year as opposed to twenty fourteen the last governor mid term election\nThe a number of absentee ballot requests has gone from nine thousand and twenty fourteen to twelve thousand this year\nUm in terms of registration total back in twenty fourteen the last midterm\nThere were four hundred thirty nine thousand registration totals in twenty six team that jumped up to four hundred sixty one thousand as one might expect in the presidential election but this year it's gone up again to four hundred sixty three thousand registrations in the county\nAlong with that and I find this very interesting I'm comparing to twenty Seventeen our current numbers\nThe the registration totals for women and men have remained almost the same percentage wise within a tenth of a percentage point\nUm it says that that there may be issues that are at play here and there probably are\nBut it's not looking at one group it seems to be an across the board appeal to voters we find that enormously encouraging in the league we find that that um it does seem to be issue was driving we've got incumbents who have been in for a long time\nWe've got a challengers but not in in huge numbers you know one a challenger for each for each office\nAnd um and there doesn't seem to be anything significantly different in that dynamic but the response which seems to be um again by a by issues that are in some cases exploited by a man in Bridget but certainly there are so many breaking down barriers to voting in New York\nAnd uh and bill reform and in so many others\nUm I I simply see a really encouraging\nTrend toward focus voters were looking for information\nYeah I I I Am not going to sort of rain on that parade I mean if you see encouraged that that's a positive thing I think the real test going forward will be in the odd numbered years are you getting participation and even numbered years is easier to get participation for the obvious reasons um it's pretty discouraging and the number of years I I still\nFeel it is it is and and frankly I think that's an education challenge for the league and other groups because in in the in the final\nAnalysis of what the president does has less day to day effect than who's on your school board\nWho's on uh the city council who's on county lab she was on um who's on town boards that sort of thing and uh and that's an education challenge but hopefully with um with the races that are underway currently\nFolks will as the leak hopes not just vote but become voters you know once you voted once then you become the voter you start to follow issues you start to follow candidates and pay more attention in between um there's more ... than we've seen okay well let's turn Damon Scanlon who's ... an education policy analyst for\nThe children's agenda and we're talking about issues that are at the top of their list\nNot only in this election season certainly but going forward and at the top of your list was funding for education which is you know broad based ... specific look\nYeah and I I Would say it's not so much that it's at the at the top of our lives but I think it is an issue that voters um themselves should be very aware of in this election cycle because up particularly with or what may be the outcome of the state Senate election there could be a big push in terms of funding for schools\nOr this relates back to foundation ... which is an issue of equity among school districts and your Monroe County our schools are are under the formula that has been developed by the state could potentially get hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding\nAnd this is so number one if the state Senate flips for example this could happen um and could or is it something that you would expect to happen if the Senate flips\nI mean there's a lot of unknown variables because whenever you have changes in power you don't know what's going to happen to there's new players at the table but it the the the change and I was very insider baseball right but when when the the issue with the independent democratic caucus and the fact that a lot of folks\nUm were voted out of their position to it's split and caucus with the Republicans\nI that's an illustration of how important primaries are and and people who vote in those elections have huge sway I'm a I'm what they call a prime voter and I I get handwritten notes from people running for city council and for judge ships and things like that like you can have a\nA huge influence on the more elections people forget how important those small elections are are in the bigger picture\nAnd I would say that that funding could be a big piece that moves in something that is a little bit more closer to us a would be the issue of school discipline and supporting kids we have a a crisis here in Rochester where thousands of kids are suspended every year for a lot of minor incidents is and it's a it's a racial justice issue we know that\nPolicies that we're asking people to think about when they go to the voting booth\nAnd subject to school suspensions here's Dan in Brighton under so go ahead Dan\nHi I have a professional background being involved with kids who have trouble in school and I found that they liked being suspended because they were um they didn't like being in school and I could\nThat convinced the school personnel to do something like at least in school suspension where they're being punished but still in school and I'll hang up and hear what people have to say\nAll right Dan thank you get there was a a a push a number of years ago by the Russians the school district to shift to in school suspensions\nUm and that could possibly be an effective tool if the education the students are still getting was effective but we see inconsistencies in terms of are they just held in a room somewhere so it was it any better than being in out of school suspension that's debatable\nUp but really I I think the caller brings up a good point is that allowing the child to recognize the behavior\nUm to get to a place where there are more invested in their education that's that's really the goal so the intervention needs to follow the evidence and the evidence shows that removing a child from the classroom only leads to them falling behind academically let me read\nA tweet from a listener named Paul Ayman because I think it connects to the question on funding and foundation aid indirectly he's talking about ... Williams and\nAnd Paul saying as a conservative he thinks the next time a success next time our CSP hires a superintendent a successful business person should be hired it's amazing they function this long there's no accountability with a billion dollar budget dark out of control unions and the children suffer a total paradigm shift\nIs needed that's that is from Paul who um has raised the issue in the past on the subject of billion dollar budgets and and what we're spending on education well why do you need all that money what do you what are you spending it on now every school is different every district has different but if that foundation aid came in the way you want to see it happen\nCan you get a sense for how schools would generally used additional dollars ... ...\nGeneral operating it so it could be spent on anything yet and there's going to be discretion locally but I I Would say that I agree that the money needs to be better spent and some of the analysis that we've done has shown gaps that showed that there's been problems in terms of\nUh how accountability is measured in in this in specifically the Rochester city school district so we need to rebuild that faith and where money goes\nBut there's also very clear evidence that or even if I'm sixty percent of the dollars are spent effectively the new dollars right that still going to improve child's lives in the city and there's there's a question fundamentally\nHow can we both uh increase the pie and do it better and I I wouldn't say we're advocating for some specific dollar amount were advocating to make sure every child gets a quality education\nAnd that they're ready to succeed both in life or emotionally or through their health through their social development so that's that's the angle I don't want to type things to dollar figures but if dollars themselves can improve those kids' lives and that's when I'm going to go after\nHim in ... would you uh would you direct listeners to either a website or an online resource to learn more about issues that you think are pertinent\nHere serious sharing seeking I'm Glad the children's agenda WWW dot the children's agenda dot org\nAnd um there's a opportunities and on a website to learn about the issues I Would say again particularly in about ten days and be looking for the answers to the state ... candidate um questionnaires and they will those will be healthy and get the answers the questions that we're talking about\n... and Mary where would you direct people to learn more about what the league is doing and what you've got coming up on\nOur website is W.

of\nPublic health some of the results in this poll run counter to stereotypes we often see perpetuated in the mass media or being pushed by some politicians that rural America is dying and emptying out\nAnd I agree with that and I also think that the the fight for human rights I like to call it a human rights I'm here in America\nWas really a war and when you were at war you have different branches of the armed forces that have that do different things\nYeah different tactics that could cause I should say don't mean to interrupt you know I but I Want to make clear to listeners it's not that Thurgood Marshall disagreed with the goals of Martin Luther king junior if some of their tactics\nHe absolutely yeah absolutely um\n[laughter]\nMy my wife's a stepfather was involved in uh the the civil rights movement down in Montgomery, Alabama\nAnd he talks about that some of of the marchers a disagreed with king and that there were different strategies that they didn't agree with because they felt that they didn't have the political clout\nTo make the change in that if if you moved too quickly then that would give the ones who were gangs who human rights or a leg up\nUm the the police force the government was all against them\nAnd what power that they have really that if they knew okay now we're protesting a bus segregation we we we will operate like a cancer and just go into a different vein and and make it a something different that you have to fight against they a lot of them felt like the struggle would just be endless ...\nWell let's talk a little bit about Thurgood Marshall's view of the law and how he used the law as I think the laws of weapon um which comes up in in Thurgood on numerous occasions and will kind of work through his career because as ... as we all know brown but we are going to talk about some of his other work and how monumental it was\nWhen the when the capital Harry's were happening recently I had a I was emailing with a couple of family members who are attorneys who just have interesting views on whether you're an originalist or whether you're sort of a living breathing document person\nDifferent views of of how you look at the constitution and one that I remember one of the emails I said before knowing I was going to go see Lester blow me out of the water was Thurgood\nWas it I look at Thurgood Marshall is a very interesting view on the constitution as a living breathing document because number one for people of color it damn well better be because we we didn't form a country that that lived up to its ideals ... ... and number two he he was quoted in a number of places and sometimes criticized for this is basically saying\nHe wanted to do what's right and let the law catch up and\nThat's the way of saying I'm not going to if there is a law that's sort of poorly argued or justices that opinion poorly written\nBut the right thing is done I'm not going to pick it apart technically and say well you know it's partly reason so we're going to it's the wrong thing to do a you know in terms of for the public good but we're going to throw it out Thurgood did not believe that at least from what I've read and seen interviews with him he believed that protecting people in the best you can with the law\nUm and and working to change it within the law and using as the ... I just found it fascinating\nAnd yet here we are you know a month ago Kevin us hearings are happening people are debating this stuff a month later Thurgood on stage and a lot of Americans are still like it was their good so I I just find it interesting so Lester what stands out to you from his career and how he interpreted the role of the law in his work as an attorney and then the justice\nI ... it was just brilliant you know new um was was giving me\nSo much wisdom in in the rehearsal process and he talked about the genius of of him and a Charlie Houston\nTo use\nSeparate but equal I mean that's just brilliant you use separate but equal to get justice or a law that was designed to do nothing but give you injustice that's brilliant\nA N and in an environment was where the law was really not on your side it it it just wasn't\nYou know I when when people hear about a lot of the lynchings and you know they they were a pulled out of jails like how do you think they got them out of jail somebody had to let them out [laughter]\nSo the law enforcement ... was not on the side of of of black people then and he had so much courage so much faith in this country it it boggles my mind\nThat that ... to me he he is the epitome of what a true patriot is to really believe\nIn the law and the constitution of a country that has been doing nothing but the fresh thing you and taking advantage of you and using you for basically nothing but then your physical labor\nBut he truly believe he believes in that breathing document that if us living is don't grow up\nThat's so well said what a definition of a patriot yeah that is such a beautiful way to look at it and by the way when Lester talks about using separate but equal kind of turning it on its head tell us a little bit more about what you mean\nBy that yeah well the the the last separate but equal what actually that there was nothing equal about that were there was never and it was just in a separate exactly it was nothing meant to be equal about it\nSo he and a Charlie Houston uh decided to go into the courts and demand that courts a enforce that law\nAnd and make it I'm truly equal uh uh um the um\nPlus they versus Ferguson uh it it started out just to keep the racist separate to keep them down trodden and he decided to use that you you you have to truly give us equal facilities in every arena because that's the law\n\nAnd they didn't get a lot of them didn't have the money and of course they didn't want to do it and if you are not going to a um enforce that law then the law has to grow up and it has to change so\nYeah the show has this really dramatic and uh rebutting moments where Thurgood Lester is taking us through how they did that how they proved\nYou know how many master's degrees do you have on your staff hired ... what are the ways that we could show that we've got separate but unequal yes and make it unequivocal in a court of law yeah just just outstanding stuff little what do you want audience to take away from from this\nOff you know there's just you sit there as you mentioned and and you're just riveted by the things you thought you knew and and didn't I'm One of the most important things to me it is and you sort of got added when you were\nTalking about people not being aware of Thurgood Marshall\nAnd that is that there have been a group of African American intellectuals that has been operating outside of the gaze of the larger society for ... centuries since they came here\nAnd you when you see third good you look at that continuum\nOf of intellectual\nA scholarship and a application you see that it isn't a new thing that Thurgood was taught by Charlie used in Thurgood gives a lot of credit to the character that his father built in him and so forth\nI have a friend who's passed now who has a saying that I just love to explain it uh August Wilson says I'm standing in my grandfather's shoes and I love that image because it's exactly what Thurgood he carried that as far as he could\n[noise]\nExcuse me and uh uh you know it was picked up by other people and that's what has happened in this movement throughout you know from back in slavery was work slowdown and all sorts of ways of of maintaining progress and dignity and so forth\nYou're hearing loop Bellamy who's the director of Thurgood Lester parade the actor who plays Thurgood Marshall any one person\nShow it Thurgood is on stage at ... theater until a through November Eighteenth and I just got a note from producer mega mackerel also had the chance just to see Thurgood and was I think just as amazing as I was\nAnd it reminds me that you know less dress Thurgood recites part of Langston Hughes is let America be America so in the age of make America great again\nYou know your show brings us back to what Langston Hughes had to say which again talk about interesting people crossing pass right ... you know\nI'm every night that I recite that point I think of the uh the make America make America Again slogan\nAnd I'm the first time I'm a we did it in rehearsal I couldn't get through it um\nRemarkable conversation about thirty are hearing from these the team behind the show go on the news dot org click that donate button it's quick it's easy and you'll be part of the ... team and family helping to continue the strong foundation of member support that we have here\nAt the station and again that's thanks to David strongest Pittsburgh member since Nineteen Seventy three he's helping us with our dollar for dollar magic just until two o'clock so if he enjoyed the conversation today you'd like to hear more just like it you can help us do that four or five four sixty three hundred\nAmerican I Am a I remember some comments from listeners\nIn recent months one at the beginning of summer said connections podcasts are her version of beach reading which is nice\nBut also we also we often hear from teachers who talk about actually using parts or all of these ... pod cast and broadcast to supplement education and you wonder if they're going to do that with ... it's going to go see Thurgood on stage\nBut that always means the world to us because we tried to bring in people who will sort of open our our eyes and ears to the world or we've tried to bring an underrepresented voices it matters to us\nAnd Meghan very few NPR member stations have their own local talk show any more so that part of calling for five or sixty three hundreds to make sure\nWe still have local talk I mean there are alternatives we could throw in from noon to two and we want to do it\nNo we don't and were sure that you don't eat or if you're listening to connections today or every day we have very loyal listeners we hear from you via email on social media you call us during the show we have a caller on the line right now thank you for engaging with us every single day we are here because of you can be part of our team be part of this connection steam with me and I've been in Rob rayner engineer\nFor five four sixty three hundred or go online to ... dot\nOrg alright thank you Meghan All right so the conversation about Thurgood Marshall I Want to grab a phone call from Lisa in Rochester go ahead Lisa\nI first I Want to reiterate this is really a jewel and I did get a contributing factor because of the show\nAnd it's a great discussion you discuss briefly um you know Charlie and the and the uh the legends who who built this plan\nA for desegregation I'm I Wonder if there's going to be part of the show that discusses Constance ... who is one of the foot soldiers and then became the second circuit court judge\nOr the answer at least from a viewer perspective is is no but the ... that does not mean any disrespect in fact a loop Bellamy director you want to jump in there well\nYeah thank you for for that um what you point out although she isn't mentioned in the text of this performance\nIs the breath of people who contributed to making this thing happened um I can tell you a wonderful story and I won't say the man's name because they don't want to embarrass him here he lives in Rochester he's a retired attorney\nAnd he did the voice for us of Earl Warren\nSo I'm Talking with this this gentleman about or war and he said well you know right out of law school I worked for health education and welfare and it was my job to go around the country and check for compliance to brown\nSo this is a this is a man that no one knows anything about who who contributed mightily to to what we we consider to be a a halfway decent life today\nAnd I thank you for calling in and making her name live again because it's important that we understand that it isn't one person who makes this happen\nLisa thank you for that and during a brief break we were just discussing that\nThurgood Marshall has had people like Elena Kagan clerked for him and and has his own sort of an impact\nRippling through out the the judicial system so um that's just a great reminder Lisa and Thurgood gets I'm sort of front building of brown v board but certainly it was a team effort and it was just maybe a month ago that we had Carlotta Walls on this program who was one of the the Little Rock nine and talking about\nHer book her life\nAnd how what three four years later after brown v board wasn't easy this didn't make it easy this didn't mean well brandy board happened it was unanimous which by the way here's another cool thing about the play even though you know which way brown v board is going to go\nEarl Warren you ... you get this reminder of Earl Warren history Japanese internment you're gone I thought it was unanimous I'm sure it's not going to be unanimous on trial was wrong about that and it's still unanimous them and they give you this it's there's a lot of drama that you didn't expect\nIn the play 'em but having said that it doesn't mean it's easy I think that Lester it's important for all of us to remember that\nThurgood Marshall's work here is none of this is sort of clean and simple progress I mean it it's it's it's a push it to push back so when you talk about how you feel now are we regret thing unfortunately history progress and not a straight line right that's right that's right you know and I I think that's why\nIt's so so important to to to know your history a lot of times I'm as students we we we simply depend on um academia to tell us what they can only tell us so much\nYou have to go out and research and look and discover for yourself\nAnd ... theater has set up a for the community to discover\nA Pearl and they've left it wide open and easy to find\nBecause as you mentioned there are things that you discover that are not mentioned in in any public school that I Know of yeah I Know I didn't get it either from elementary all the way through college a Thurgood Marshall's name was\nWas never mentioned a brown v the board of education was maybe three pages yep and it was kind of glossed over you you didn't get the the the inner workings of it you you didn't get into the the blood and bones of what was happening you you didn't get a chance to\nFeel what people are real people were going through\nYou know when you say that I think of that are behind Leicester in the show we have various projections up and right after you come out and talk about the ruling on brown\nThe projection behind it is that famous photo of a woman sitting on the steps of the Supreme Court holding a news paper\nWith her daughter with her and it shows the immediacy of a decision on a ... a large court it has immediate ramifications for common everyday people yeah yeah yeah\nAnd also the pressure that Thurgood Marshall felt knowing that if you lose this case does this mean does this cement separate but equal at least for a generation does this end any chance to take a big strides forward I mean that kind of pressure sure his message sure\nYou know um and he he or she I [laughter]\nYou know it is that's brought up\nIn the play of of when he goes before the before the Supreme Court to to argue brown\nHe looks out and he sees a sea of people counting on him and his legal team [noise] wow their future their destiny their children their children's children's deaths Denise\nAre relying on\nThis case and ultimately his skill and arguing the case of the research that his team did on this case you know it it it could [noise] I'll just say it it it could\nImpoverish and in quotes and out of quotes imprisoned generations of people\nThere's a there's a great little details to how often he was interrupted by the justices compared to a wide attorney I mean there's so many things that\nI'm just add such resonance to it so before we turn to what else is doing this the season a couple more questions if you don't mind how much did you study the cadence the voice the the person how much is is this\nYour version of Thurgood how much did you try to make it as much Thurgood as you could how do you take that process\nI with someone who's um historical figures and someone as important as Thurgood you try to put as much in as as you can\n... the thing about a third good is this this play a covers a pretty large span of his life and his tone in cadences began to change\nAnd you can't put all of it in because then it'll it'll become [noise] purely academic\nAnd so some of it has to be a dramatize some of it and you have to feel the immediacy of it but any character an actor does is filtered through them [noise]\nSo what what I Believe that what's this play does is that it makes me Thurgood Marshall and it makes every member of that audience have the opportunity to also be Thurgood Marshall", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1",
