I think the video going viral ... they're probably received a lot of shaming themselves with the way they treated this gentleman and I think I Would have probably suspend them taking them aside and said we're going to do some things about this but you're gonna you're gonna be dealing with ... for a lot\nYeah you know we often with young people were often in for teen quote example you know they have community service maybe they need to go work in a shelter and maybe they needed to go do go serve people who are less fortunate to really have a struggle there is not just so easy you know I'm terminate I go get another job\nAnd I don't know if you're learning aren't they and now you're angry and you learn a little and I think that you know I always when I was the and the students that are itchy I used to say you need to make a student who is misbehaving a little uncomfortable inconvenient and that may not be kicking them off campus battalion they can't participate in anything but\nA class so you know there's a lot of organizations I think often go the extreme we've seen it I'm from Starbucks and others you know where employees had misbehaved and\nThey're trying to make up for it but I'm with you I mean let's really talk about how it feels to be that person\nSo All right thank you so it was All right so let's talk about fashion week here and we are going to be talking about these various issues of who benefits and how but I Do want to kind of fuel back a little bit and say how many years you've been doing special\nIt is our ninth year Joni Ernst two thousand and ten right now that are ... how did this or were you\nKnow it wasn't mine but it it was a group of us who got together and they were like you know what we've got so many great designers in Rochester let's do something for them let's get them on the runway a you know we've always done fashion shows whether it be a country clubs are malls or et cetera et cetera\nBut this is a small group got together and started to talk and it was about the same time that I was writing the business plan for my first business\nAnd uh it it it all came together so quickly and um maybe too quickly\nAnd we did the best we could and it was a great we gave birth to this great idea and then it like quickly snowballed from there and just grew to this what we have today and it's been fantastic I mean I think it was only a couple of days at first\nTwo days two days thirty thousand right um and we were we're looking for petty cash out or for the model I remember and I was not really in but I was watching right from behind because someone had said to me I think we're going to do this better if we have the proceeds\nGo to a not for profit right so let's pick a not for profit some ... balls yet up for a good time you know they said\nThat I had time off for a good time I was really just a spectator here CFO your chief fashion organizer Meg Monday probably said that you know figure this out and then I saw\nEvans than a kernel of interest even those two nights as they weren't tremendously organized of you didn't have the same kind of social media and we didn't raise a lot of money but those places were packed\nAnd people love the idea that connection to the work at the center has taken a little bit longer to make its way this year I've told people were taking the gloves off\nThe the the same as what we talk about it's not how you stand it's a stand you take out they're constantly making sure people understand you can look good and do good\nUm at first we were just all about the glamour right ... ... yeah slowly slowly slowly this community loves it fashion show a lot of the energy mhm I mean it just it's it's really just\nA you know one of the things I was sort of grousing last night I was telling my husband who was watching football and wasn't really listening but that was better because I was ranting about the fact that all the tickets were sold for Saturday Night and people were upset with us\nAnd he's like how can you be upset about a sellout and I said I Know you're right we should be grateful for that so Rochester has a thirst for this\nUm you know Joan and others I mean I Can't even tell you it's a lot of work for her a lot of work\nAnd for our models I mean ... all of our models how many nights are we on the runway ... five nights and all these models for free ... any

for just like really shine a light on it it's like I have to put out for everybody who's watching and then\nThe ones who are coming up like me who are not only growing up in\nCircumstances that may not be the best with the ones who are because I feel I've seen both sides of it because I'm very very connected in the corporate world as well when it comes down to doing videos and motivational speaking so I see both ends of the spectrum and for me it's like I have to be the one to bridge the gap and\nHelp people on the other side I understand like you know you are blessed to have these things you know like\nUm other people don't have it as good as you do and to be able to pour that compassion in there as well you know you say like you didn't you you couldn't imagine what it's like to go through those circumstances and for me to be in it I didn't go through a lot you know I have friends killed and seen a lot of crazy things but I wasn't actually and it\nSo that's still makes me you know my my own little piece but to know that when I got to Carney there were kids who just we live in what way different circumstances\nWhat what is it that you need and what is it that you have to do and so I think I really wanted to get involved with the Senate to be able to say that I've been able to help push this along with everyone else that's been involved for so long um and to really invest in people\nYou know like Chris Chris this amazing I'm so glad that we met today but you know there are so many so many different people that that the center just highlights and is able to um to

embellish when I'm curious to know what a ... fashion week does for retailers like yours\n[noise] well you know I opened up my first business uh two months before the very first fashion week uh launched and I I really uh give credit to fashion week for my first year of success\nOr you know as a small business owner I always promote shop small shop local but I tell you what that\nFirst year as a small business owner is so scary even as a first year you know designer I Would imagine you know your first year you're launching a new\nConcept but with the assistance of fashion week\nUm and you know it was quick I was quickly branded if you will I I was able to get myself branded with a fashion week of Rochester and know what's the difference between now and it was opening those eight years later ah I was able to open up a second and third store a which I have dissolve the third into my second\nAnd it had just it's I I get you know I I feel like I get what I give we do a lot of philanthropy in in a different way throughout the community and I'm I'm just really proud of being able to\nYou know sustain ourselves a and my panache team and fashion week is a huge part of\nThat how much you're going to raise this year for the sort of working working at bringing about seven twenty five now remember\nThere's twenty five dollars seven [laughter] yes your number five thousand over there and try to find that there are others as you said lots and lots and lots of\nExpenses but at the end of the day will get close to five hundred thousand in pure profit now we've got lots of expenses because we have generators and runways and lights in toilets and tense and big tents and I'm\nAll for your pocket money I don't know anything like that I Would go so hard at you I I told her that I'd be fine I don't like an extra\nUnintended mistakes but in his mistakes nonetheless\nI'm I Wish they hadn't happened yeah I Wish that the posting in that way had not happened I think it missed represents what we want to have happening in our ...\nLet me turn to him oh who's with the New York's seal you as well and how you view decision was kind of played out over the last week or two\nYeah I mean it's nothing new to participate in because they are private businesses after all I think just thinking as you know just a community member and as a civilian we already know a lot of us will grow up around here know of that\nAre you as being one that's only welcome to a certain part of the neighborhood I mean we know that that neighborhood is actually going to a major transformation with the inner lip construction and you know the north union areas that are being built with a new housing units and whatnot\nAnd as we're talking about what is this actually going to mean for a city\nIt kind of unfortunately reinforced ... a lot of us why a lot of us have avoided that porn or over the city um and it's because it's you know a wealthier part of the city it's been representative of the majority white\nResidents of the city um and I think a lot of people especially people of color have not felt welcome there I mean if we want to date back to like the black lives matter rally that happened I Believe two years ago on a lot of the dispute actually happened in the east and\nUm and while I don't necessarily remember all the facts I mean again it resonates with what that what that part of the neighborhood represents and I think we need as a city as we're talking about diversity and inclusion we need to truly understand what that means we can just see where I diverse community and then have private businesses that come into the city\nWho sit in the city for years I mean those bars have been there for forever\nThose restaurants have been there for a while to 'em and then you know subtly not welcome sir and people um I Do believe that they were they had a racial tendon undertone I Do believe that there was you know there was it was all intentional I Do believe that I Can't not necessarily through the NY feel you can't speak to them\nBut I speak again as a civilian has to you know there was I Believe a video that went around that was viral of not not I'm not sure which bar in the same and wearing a young black woman and a young white woman were dressed exactly the same bus and the white woman was permitted and the black woman was not\nAnd so you know we have people in I Believe there are some of the owners and I I get I don't know them um that responded on social media about why they\nDecided to claim to fame was well the the white woman who was wearing frayed genes which are loud and the black lives were ripped jeans they looked exactly\nYes and I saw the image that looks exactly the same as it was a pretty bogus or you know going back to what you're talking about in terms of the subway and and the and the store and\nThat was it not condoning donors nice or how do we help people's and learn a lesson versus just shaming the people that did it too so we were in you know I said last week when I was on with you that we walk and grace\nThat we have to learn how to forget that we have to learn how to instruct I Know that some of those bar owners are sorry that they were perceived that way that they want to learn and do better we have got to be open hearted right back\nThat's one of the roles of us okay both\nSides I can tell you a lot of them won't return calls for me okay and um have shown very little bug defiance ... not all yeah and I'm with you I always want to be constructive as opposed to have these conversations are feeling a constructive yeah now I think as private business owners are up to them to make values judge yeah\nAnd then we'll see and then let's see so we're close to live on that were done to our last minute or so ... it's fashion week of Rochester dot dot org and could only go to one about next week load\nWell I Would have said Saturday but that's how I Would come Thursday night I'd I'd say a Thursday night show ... going to be their panache is going to be there next ... next Thursday night I Would get on line before you even turn the radio off or maybe they're gonna keep it on for the second hour hope they will\nUm and go to a vet bright and and I'm On fashion week it I've rushed her dot org and get your tickets you know there's tickets at thirty five bucks at the other thing we're never going to be that fashion show that makes it impossible for people to come at all ages and stages of course the Wednesday show is free for a kid so there's that\nBut we are always going to be that show where somebody can afford to come for thirty five dollars\nOkay so next Thursday nights that's the ... or ... what's going to be a well we're on our runway\nShow is Thursday night and Saturday Night and I\nI I Love being everyday president for fashion week there's just a buzz and uh you know you didn't answer the question you were there our future so why not go every single soldier said what are you

MCA is I Believe it's called now\nAre two of my board member organizations are our border communities are in the buffalo partnership in the north country chamber cross border trade is important obviously upstate New York largely rural on a dairy so I Know that those were some talking or some issues that got dealt with in this new agreement that were positive\nUh the market's been reflective of of I think more optimistic climate and there's been tax reform there's been some other things or you know you'll always have arguments whether it's a you know the current administration or the previous administration or external business factors but ah you know certainly there are some things that the business community has been responding positively\nSure and when when you look at that tax bill generally an checkup states an organization that has been very critical of taxation and businesses at the state level fair to say that is correct so we'll talk about that ah but do you think that the tax bill has been good for workers good for small businesses\n[noise] you know there I think anytime you got reduce taxes that's positive they're obviously in New York there have been some issues whether it relative to salt or other things\nOn ... an organization hasn't necessarily weighed in on the specifics are focuses more on policy out of Albany but you know that's a debate I think the legislature is going to have both candidates\nIn major parties for governor the governor and mark Montanaro have articulated property tax plans that they feel will be beneficial to New York and you know those are things we'd like to see a conversation focused on\nA you have a legislative scorecard and this is the editor tradition for an checkups dates and these are obviously I'm being constructed before you got there but they're basically created by a formula right well that's correct tell our listeners how you create your legislators\nYeah so I I think it had on Shaq we feel very

and deep dive what policy items their legislators are voting on\nAnd you can actually go on to our website on shackled upstate dot com go into the scorecard actually click individual bill memos on everything we've either\nOffered our support on or off or opposition you know some of the things that we've waited on are making the property tax kept permanent that was a big victory by Governor Cuomo at the time in in his first term was getting that property tax cap we want to see that extended beyond twenty twenty you as it's currently set the sunset\nOr we want to see things like mandate relief coupled with that so we can finally get someone burning of our you know our highest property taxes as a percentage of home value in the country\nAre there are other issues or whether it's prevailing wage reforming our scaffold law or you know expansion of paid family leave that we have some concerns about so uh you can go in look at all the bills that we've opined on and uh see how your legislator did relative to the rest of the state\nWe're going to get to ... and I will for listeners I Will mentioned the specific scores as I'm sure if I'm coming up here up where can people find online\nW. W. W. dot ... upstate dot com you can go to our Facebook on shackled upstate and you'll find a score cards on there and be able to check out to see how your legislated in\nBefore we get into some of the specifics there let me grab a couple of phone calls Paul and Mary and is first go ahead Paul\nYeah good afternoon I'm I just wanted to make a comment about um my\nFuture plans as a retiree my wife is about to retire [noise] um we are definitely going to be leaving the state I'm I'm a lifelong resident of New York state [noise]\nI'm I'm very discouraged by the lack of progress with a campaign finance reform a Government Reform in general and the taxation rates here in New York um especially on retirees are onerous um so we're looking at several other states in the country to move to\n'em and it's disappointing because there are many great things about New York state and especially this area\nBut it's not a friendly place for people who are retired\nNow that that to stay there for one second if you could call because what he's bringing up is the state of taxation for retirees which is a little different than the state of taxation for business do view those as related\nSure absolutely uh you know obviously our retirees have a lot of a lot of wealth I think ... and when they leave they take that with them a lot of purchasing power um and I it's holistic I think we're in we are a pro employer and pro taxpayer organization\nSo when you're saying that you're leaving New York because of our tax climate it it's not just about employers it's about taxpayers as well and it's an expensive place to live in is an expensive place to retire or I'm curious Paul what's driving your decision is you're looking at other states what kind of criteria are you looking for that that we don't have here in New York\nI'm I'm basically looking at states that don't tax Social Security income that don't tax uh IRAs for one case\nUm that have ... much lower property taxes I mean it's amazing to me that uh you know we have a house that's of value added a two hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd we pay approximately Seventy five hundred dollars in school and property tax and it almost every other state that we look in you can commit equivalent home and you're paying a at least half ... sometimes even a third of that for property split on property taxes so\nChat about the rather but I'm not really that big a factor to be honest with you um I we we enjoyed\nAll four seasons so that's not a huge factor but I have to get back to the political situation in New York I just I'm discouraged that um you know that over the last couple of decades there's always a lot of noise about reforming government and reforming a campaign finance and so forth\nNever ... never any real progress it's hosting the lip service\n... what kind of change or the ... campaign finance do you want to see\nSome I think that I'm a more transparency I'm less of the mistake this year\nBut um right now in New York and Los I'm wrong there are numerous ways for I'm an optimist owners and large large contributors to contribute without you know without any real transparency and I think those those people\nThose kinds of things influence politicians and and they don't influence them for the betterment of the general citizen [noise] okay ah\nOh thank you for the phone call I appreciate that yeah dark money is certainly an issue in just about anywhere in politics and and um if you really want to find a way to fund campaigns I'm In and around certain existing laws sure yeah the there are ways to do that's opposed disappointed about that at this point about taxes\nHe's thinking about moving weather's not at the top of the list we had a a rich was calling an earlier and we lost rich but he was saying um [noise] he thinks the weather does play a part in leaving people living upstate look I I don't think you can argue\nThat New York's climate visa the Arizona or Southern California or something\nIs a detriment but I don't know that that's the main\nDrive [noise] yeah well I mean you you mentioned those two places I mean not to personalize it for myself I my sister left this area as a recent mass you got a master's degree and I had to leave and she went to Arizona and ended up in Southern California\nBut she didn't do it in search of you know Sonny whether she left because she had a master's degree and couldn't find a job here in New York state\nUh you know because of that we not only lost our sister to the other side of the country but her two kids and I know and my parents that's pretty hard having your grandkids\nOn the other side of the country and that story is not unique to to my family that's for sure I think unfortunately too often what you're seeing his family's having to see their kids and their grandkids the elsewhere they want to come back I Know I'm at an age where\nA lot of my friends are settling down getting married and wanting to start their families and they'd love to do it in their hometowns of buffalo Rochester Syracuse Albany but they need to find opportunity that can be comparable to what they've gotten in North Carolina or Florida or Texas or something like that\nSo until we get serious about I think improving our business climate here in New York and making it a place where businesses want to locate as opposed to businesses struggling to survive you're going to continue to see families you know find greener pastures then struggled to come home\nOr at least there's eight four four to nine five talk it's toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five or to six three to be ... here in Rochester to six three\nNine nine nine for you want to weigh in on these legislative score cards from ... if you want to weigh in and what is driving migration in or out of New York state for workers or are you able to still work find a not only a place to work but a comfortable place to retire or are you thinking about

guy working up here in the district I had to work closely with Republicans Democrats folks who I never asked their partisan affiliation and this organization is not part of it and we we've gotten

to connections I met and dust and let's get back to your phone calls because a lot of folks weighing in Eric in Rochester next go head Erich\nHey thanks so much for taking my call really appreciate that I just a couple of things do or what it would be great if you're talk a little bit more about the costs we keep talking about the fact that we have underfunded mandates or we have too many taxes and we're looking at lower that I understand the taxpayers coalition all this this is what a lower those Texas\nBut I don't hear the corresponding discussion about things that we would have to live without him what kind of culture do you want to live and what contributed you want to live in um the worst roads ... more people homeless you are so benefactor here last break you talked about\nUh Rochester this area of being a really tough place where people were handicapped but I get that correct in terms of what were your next programs about [noise]\nUm but yeah that's exactly right poverty for people who are living with disabilities yes\nRight so what kind of culture did we want to live in a while but they're trying to help that is necessary for those people to all of us to succeed uh and grow and then the second row quickly or maybe not a point the question\nIs when we talk about a high taxes are we only talked about a narrow band of Texas are we looking at the complete picture my kids do live in Virginia and I find myself helping to fund the educational initiatives that would be paid for\nA at schools here in Rochester so some things that uh or at least in the community some things that\nYou know the kids with pitched for the kids in Brighton enjoy as extracurricular activities I'm paying for in Virginia for my grandchildren to enjoy those same extracurricular activities and the tax bill on just owning a car is much higher than the renewal fee\nFor renewal future in Rochester New York state so I'm not\nI'm just asking I'm not usually just curious as to whether or not we really are comparing apples to apples\nOkay why don't you stay there for a second Eric and I'll let Michael cracker response\nYou know that there are certainly things in New York that that New York decides to find that other states do not and that's you know maybe a quality of life decision that New Yorkers have to have is we ... what kind of things what kind of services do they want their government to provide but I think New York also do some things that are unique to this state that drive up the costs\nOf doing business in the state to drive up the cost of living in this state\nYou know the scaffold log just nowhere else in the United states of America and that drives up the cost of our private and public project because we have some the highest insurance rates for contractors in the country or makes it a difficult place for contractors to want to do business it adds to the cost of our projects that ultimately coming\nA lot of them that are receiving public dollars are coming out of our taxpayer coffers\nAre going to jump in and all that Michael continue in a second\nI think probably very little has changed a scaffold law in recent years in the state is that true that is correct okay so if you go back I bet you was twenty Fifteen maybe even late twenty fourteen Brian Sampson one of your predecessors was on this program along with I think if I'm remembering correctly some union leadership who support the scaffold law\nBrian was talking about the problems with it\nAnd it was the luckiest most in the wee policy that they actually probably ever had but it was fascinating I'm ... and it probably is unchanged in terms of context and substance of you want to go back and listen to\nAn hour of connections on scaffold law it's there and it probably hasn't\nChanged it and there's nobody better in the state to talk about it and Brian stamps and he's been fighting that fight for a long time but you know that is I think just indicative of a of a unique we New York policy\nThat drives up the cost of doing business in the state and cost taxpayers money so is there are others other other yes absolutely you know I mentioned workers' compensation reform that was a good get but that was a problem that was again uniquely New York uh right now the legislatures looking at expanding\nAre the definition of prevailing wage and what's a ... a public project and that will have I think I anywhere between twenty ten to twenty five percent cost increase in any project that receives even one single dollar of public incentive it'll make\nPrivate investment almost impossible in upstate New York we don't have the kind of a developer demand that you do in downstate so those are issues that are\nThings that the legislature is doing to drive up costs of doing business in the state of New York you mentioned paid leave early or is it hard to be against paid leave right now in this country no I don't I don't think so because there there are there are things about paid leave that we can understand but then there are other things that just go a little bit too far\nAnd one of the things that we've got to make sure that we do we protect the reality that employer shouldn't be responsible for funding\nThe paid family leave pot of money that's out there right now it's employee driven not employer driven we need to protect that\nAnd then as they're looking to expand there are things that we'd like to have a conversation about is does this expansion go too far as you're going to be too burdensome on employers particularly small employers who maybe can't live without an employee for an extended period of time without any impact of their business\nSo you know these are things I was just an unfair port this this afternoon sitting down with senator funky having a discussion about some of these issues I appreciated him taking the time to talk to me about it or\nSomething I'm hearing a lot of from employers is you know listen did we did does is just go a little too far or things we can do to bring a sin and make it a little easier on employers\nOkay Eric you want to follow up and I'll go ahead\n[noise] they only thing I Would ask about issues like prevailing wage for a major one thing I don't want that our culture that trust our race to the bottom so I don't walk up when I subcontract work out I don't want their subcontractors to be able to hire\nA stream slave wages strike because they couldn't get away with it or what but look that feel to be somewhat level so that\nIf I'm looking at a little bit or if I'm looking at a low request for proposal but I Know but everybody is planning same level in terms of that field and what their top and starting their workers for because that's the value of actual court and she'll be even go it will drive up the overall cost of providing a service\n[noise] no I I I can understand that but I also think we need to look at what the you know what the wages are in a particular region and make sure that ah the folks you know we're not we're not far exceeding what is a typical wage in an area\nI'm One of our listeners rights and to say the comment about small businesses is questionable catch you hire attempt give new dad's time with their kids are men time to care for families for example you wouldn't have to give a attempt benefits\n[noise] well I mean one that that's already a cost and then you're you're you're having a cost one employer and that they're going to hire new person a can or can't do the job of the same quality that you know full time employee could is our training costs that are associated with that there are a lot of variables that go into a particularly for a small business say you've got somebody who's\nYou know they're they're your payroll specialist if they go out on leave\nI don't know that you can assume just hire attempt to come in and it managed to payroll your company\nSo you know there are just there unintended consequences for some of these policies that are very onerous on small businesses and and all the businesses but but particularly those you know small employee based businesses so so yeah yes you are obviously an an employer have to look at that as a solution but is that really effective way for them to be able to run their\nButts right and so the some of the more vitriolic a response to this as we've heard this debate in this state about paid leave in this country frankly those who favor would say well what are you saying Michael you gotta give businesses the right to tell new parents you don't get any benefits you don't get any protection you don't get nearly\nWell but I I I I Do think some sometimes these policies do you take a cynical view of employers are in the ... one of the employers and I talked to hundreds have sort of saying I care about my employees I I Want to make sure that you know they're being able to care for their families or whether it's\nYou know a a new member of their family and birth that's you know celebration or or a loss in bereavement situation\nI I think most employers want to be able to work with their employees and would be willing to work with their employees on a solution that's best for both parties I don't think that they necessarily feel that they need Albany to come in and tell them\nHow they should handle their employees and if you're in an organization that you feel you might not get a you know leave when necessary then maybe you should consider looking elsewhere for work because you're going to look at is this an organization that
