toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five or to six three to be ... here in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for once again we invited to the warrant administration to join us and\nUm to my knowledge producer Meg I'm back to be here back from that we did not um so uh so they're not here but I suspect we're going to hear a lot from them in the coming weeks and months as\nThey create sort of a new pathway to deciding what's going to be there\nSo I think it's Steve's making an important point for people for parse five it's not necessarily we'll I have one outcome in mind and it must be this it's more of a is the public involved is public heard and if the public going to have access to whatever ... is\nThat fair enough yeah yeah that's that's exactly what we've been pushing for a since we've formed in it started as like an like an informal groups coming out of Rochester vision and squaring other advocacy groups um\nBut we've been just pushing for public involvement better representation and in you've seen the turnout at city hall you've seen the turnout at events in that shows a very diverse group of\nOpinions we've had a survey or for the past a month now\nOr it's partial five petition dot com and we've had six hundred and eighty plus the results on that and we we saw that Ninety percent were in favor of partial five being sought it Ninety percent were opposed to in our bitchy healthy eater at parcel five in Ninety six percent\nWant parcel five a veil of both Republicans and so that's just like a ... a small\nBlimps but that that was us going out there trying to get input\nFrom the community and we hope to continue to do that you want to add to\nThat Mary yeah it just that you know you're saying it's not representative and that's very true we only totally knowledge that this\nHas to continue and it has to be brought into include and much wider variety of respondents on you know we meant to advance I like that on the movies or the downtown view and that's that's that the fringe festival on the cats I saw and that has a certain kind of demographic that comes out\nAnd we also you know we put on and on line ... ... absolutely necessary to get this survey and get the engagement out to the wider community because they can't just be a space that's programmed by um a certain demographic it has to be in ...\nSomebody asked Ben who was on this program in the\nEarly days of of the last phase of parcel five when there were four and then and then eventually\nEssentially three proposals that the city was considering when you when you brought\nVisionary square to our attention I Want to ask you what you learned in that process and how you now view what visionary square could be 'cause a lot of people are saying was back on the table is is a dead are you moving on are you adding to it so let's kind of go back to what you've learned in how you see that that now\nI think there's been a few lessons um I think a learning how much the community a field a connection to parcel five actually grew out of the visionaries where proposal I'm seeing even the opposition um\nOf having something threaten that space are being taken away from the community and having them be able to interact with it or program it or you saw the turnout to city hall\nUm I think with the proposal itself I think we certainly heard a new ideas based on it I think it's really important to to also point out that um the visionaries where proposal was always an incremental proposal or it only dealt with three years of what was planned with very um a initial steps to just even green to parcel\nUm so I think now this is a chance to\nCome back and think about the long term future um I think we still still should build incrementally I mean it it amazes me that this beloved you know one point when seven acre parcel of land in Rochester has generated as much\nConversation and programming when we've been on top of gravel the entire time I'm playing softball games or to you know thousands of the jazz festival thousands of fringe festival movies with the downtown view\nAnd many other festivals and activities um this is a real opportunity now to actually augment those\nAnd uh I think really bring the community interests that you know we did have a timeline to put in that are of pie\nOr it was a a rapid fire effort um we tried to do the best due diligence we could get something in front of the city that we've you know thought was not not only affordable or less than a hundred thousand dollars for the entire through your plan starting with the Seventy thousand dollar proposal the first year\nUm but I think now there's even more opportunity for the community to um to paint the parcel\nOkay and so visionary square technically is the base of what you might want to work on going forward but but in its old former so to speak it it's kind of defined\nI wouldn't say the ... I think I'm is you know found her like ... um I think is is very much holding to the the very initial proposal because there are ... I think he has every interest in attendance trying to bring that to parishioner reality\nUm I think kind of where I stand at this point is hearing and seeing what the community has done and reacted or over the course of the last year and a half I just want to make sure that that's a very broad and diverse group that we're working with\nUm because I Do I actually think that that's going to add to to the programming is going to add to the event is going to add to the ownership that people feel in this community over that space\nOkay now let me ask all of you if you think the city is likely to change at all from its concerned about whatever goes to parcel five needing to produce tax revenue and part of this discussion\nIs understanding what does Dr development and revenue to begin with you know David Riley former newspaper reporter who's with the center for governmental research was on this program just a few days ago talking about how\nYou know it it's easy to say well I Want a big building and want a tower or I Want the theater 'cause then you can see the cash register ringing as opposed to understanding the impact that ripples across the community when it's inclusive when it's green when it brings people out all all the months of the year\nJust a couple of days ago we had Paul Erickson from the new Rochester beacon who wrote a piece this week saying that he doubted that the city would embrace the notion of green space\nOr in some form of parcel five but he pointed to other cities in places like Columbus where where they have and I've had that measurable bill impact but I think it's probably still going to be part of the conversation we'll start with Ben go around the table how much do you have you sort of\nI again kind of going back to what you've learned throughout this process can you make the argument to the city that you understand that they feel like there's a need to move\nYou know wine or beer garden or or Wegmans has some type of food court or you know clean energy demonstrations this this is the center of the city that can a service the town square and it can be\nProgrammed with with the makers of with the the people who were running local businesses in food or with demonstration projects and cleaner and other things I I just see unlimited potential your\nCase Steve on the subject of tax revenue what do you think\nI think a indirectly or you could see the impact like you won't get the direct it in a from the sale in from the space itself it might not generate the tax revenue but indirectly\nI mean it's been shown in cities across America you see Cleveland you see Columbus UC Detroit right now these are other cities that face winters similar to us and they have public spaces that are drawing a new businesses around them Detroit especially are\nThere in the middle of downtown they had so much investment new businesses moving in around it and that's what we're seeing it midtown right now and I think\nUh having personal five a place where people wants to be at all times not just in during the daytime during lunch but like after work and I think all those things will help create a neighborhood there\nUm and I think the nice thing about making a public space is that it's low risk like if you do it\nUh with just as simple as putting sod down it's low risk and if it doesn't work you could modify it you could add to it you can take away from it but you could try it and let's see what happens because it's been three years of it being a gravel pit and it's worked and in\nThe city hasn't necessarily helped that\nBut the except for like some festivals there but a within a gravel pit people are still using it all the time it's like the college quad of Rochester even as a gravel pit Mary\nAll well why is that right there in their way to bring all that\nThey don't ... downtown and now they're talking about war how and what how I felt I write out right there [noise]\nYeah it's a\n... and he I I I think the city has earned his plans to continue to fill the inner lip I think all of it it eventually is is sort of targeted fulfill um they started with the eastern third and there I I I Do think that from what I understand they're planning to fill the rest of it does that um\nI Would say well if they are already seven years ago and they still haven't done anything to that other ...\nUm I appreciate that any thank you for the phone call and and that is making a value a valid point on the fact that there is a pretty significant housing stock already for pretty expensive high end housing\nUm I think I heard the number of ten thousand units there at ten thousand downtown residents and that's not to talk of it and the last couple of years now\nAnd and I and I know that's like bend a goal to and when you hit ten thousand is when you can start attracting certain other amenities and like ah I've said like a city target and stuff like that like you have to hit a certain number before as a developer you start really attracting\nSome retail downtown so I think they're getting closer and closer every year to ten thousand so if they're not there already\nOkay I'm Eddie thank you for that it's eight four four to nine five talked toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five to six three W ... here in Rochester to six three nine nine\nNine for let's get early break the hour and we're going to come back with Benjamin well Steve Carter Mary Lou pie in talking about their views as members of people for personal five Ben is a principal at slow road consulting who worked on the visionary square proposal\nAnd when we come back yeah they're talking about hey slow this down you know let let's continue to take community input in into it here\nBut if the city puts the throttle down on new are ... and and and wants to speed that up I'm curious to know\nYou know then do you jump back in you know do you want to see a visionary square sort of a attitude or or back on the table what is the the plan going to be if the city kind of takes a similar approach and put the clock on it so we'll talk about that will get more of our listener feedback as we talked about the future partial five I connections\nComing up in our second our University of Rochester is hosting an event tonight about Russia fell to prove it isn't\nRevitalizing rust belt cities and the way forward for city like Rochester [noise] what Kansas City due to revitalize downtown how does it urbanism come into play with the city like Rochester or guess this next hour we're going to explore the opportunities for our city and others like [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd the next ...\nCorruption scandal and greed in college basketball we talked with Microsoft lava that when he costs the buying and selling of basketball players some as young as ...\nInvolved in sports apparel companies scouts hunting parents financial concessions and billions of dollars his new book the last temptation of rent to Tina joiner [noise]\nTonight at seven welcome back to connections I met a dozen or so so Benjamin well if we see the city come out and say All right we have\nMoved the R B T. L. plan the the performing arts center the theater it's a it's a fresh slate but we want new our peace we want new ideas for partial five\nFirst of all what's that mean and and if they put a clock on it and and it's not going to be patient and sort of slow rolling in incremental as you would like what does that mean for for you and for a plan for up in space there what is what do you think's gonna happen [noise] well\nI think the first thing is you know I'm I don't know if it requires an RSP to green parcel five um if they put grass down on the law or the uses exponentially going to be increased on a day to day can actually be a comfortable space instead of being on top of gravel\nUm so that's number one and then I think um if there is a a new are a few process or if if the city looks to build upon one of the proposals that was initially\nIncluded as part of that um then I think it's about finding new partners I think you know this entire project in this this parcel has grown significantly in public awareness since since it was first talked about and I think\nWhatever was at the table then two years ago I think there's going to be more at the table now um and I and I just want to echo you know in confidence that this is something we really do feel that we can fund um at this point with private development um that we don't think we need you know tax break from the city to do this\nOr because of the fact is incremental because we're not looking to to build a skyscraper um these are much lower budgets and we we need a few willing partners who\nAre want to take ownership I'm the only thing I laugh about it is just this idea this idea that well partial five can be inexpensive to develop and it can be just about every one we still have million dollar views and I think people need to to keep that in mind you're looking at hundreds of millions of dollars worth of development around you and I actually think that's somewhat of Bryant Park is one of the things that makes that space work\nBy the way you know whether it's ... whether it's um someone else do you have people in mind who might be able to step forward and as you say sort of take ownership be involved are there are people in this community who have even been in touch sort of privately saying\nWe're ready to do it if if somebody put the clock on this we're going to get a proposal out there that this matters [noise] I I think\nThat those people are all their um and I think it's just a really making sure that we have a a a wide enough group that is going to help to um that will be inclusive that will help this planning process and actually involves some of the people that will will make it happen that the the actual landscape architects\nUm the private businesses that are interested in relocating their the technology are examples that were shared you know whether that's the free why fire some sort of solar clean energy demonstration project\nUm I I I Believe that they're all they're um I think again the awareness has grown so much in the last two years that we have a whole new pool of people um that we can bring in ... and I and one other thing I Want to stay on that is just that\nWe had many people who privately shared interest in this vision after the city had declared that they were going to go with the detailed proposal and parcel five and due to the due to come appearing a politically controversial there were people were unwilling unwilling to step into the spotlight were unwilling to be public at that time\nI think if the city gives us a green light to go ahead I think we're going to see just an incredible uh outpouring of support\nTo make sure I understand here you had people who\n... after our BTLS plan was put forward by the city which is now I think was at twenty Seventeen February no was April ... yeah what does it a year and a half ago plus yeah OK\nI'm that people came to you and said you know I I'm not I'm not about what the city is doing I I'd like to be able to say publicly it's a little dicey I Can't say public support you\nYeah exactly basically let's see how that shakes out and so now we we've had a development and I'm curious to see what type of a response\nWe have to give me some last names you know [laughter] I Can't I fair enough but maybe we vet your point maybe we will see them step forward publicly if a new process comes for\nThat absolutely I think the city just needs to give us a clear path for\nGetting married on just that and that's nice\nAnd he for public engagement um to come out don't stop coming a city council because we need to put pressure\nTo let them know how they want the are paid to be written because it how they actually has written really determined determines what kind of proposes they're going to get and we want to make sure that ... you know we we've already been doing this community engagement processor and continued to expand that so that we can come back and say what we want to hire me to look like ... and ...\nAnd for people for personal five on our website or our parcel five dot com we we have some like requirements are asks of the city in in one of those right there is to a whole different and that's something that we are going to put pressure on city council in the city to do now that\nThis is an open a clean slate again and so that's something that we think is the best way to help determine the future use of the space and the other thing is even though we we say we want to be incremental and slow in how this evolves and how what happens there involves\nWe think that immediately there should be sought they're like it's ... we can get that covered like we can help work with the city to get covered in that's a low risk and you get solved there in the spring and that's all of a sudden like Ben said that's exponentially usable\nIt's also in city code oh if you ask us you know seven eight ... ... e it says that any lot unless it's going to be on developed in the next six months and has a certain size should be cited and that never happened\nBut there's I Wonder Steve before I take a couple of phone calls is there something strategic about that do you think in your mind wants to city sees green space there the public is going to say ... and that's exactly what we want we don't we don't want that to be ... yeah I think I think it has\nBeen strategic or to not have grass there at this point I'm because in other lots all around there you see in the inner loopy you saw before the DNC was built that was had receded and that was grass and parcel five for three years has just been gravel so yeah that probably has been strategic\nI'm smart move there but now this is the chance to do it let's do it and let's make it so that people can use it so it's not an eyesore an incentive\nTo seven year olds are very tired of getting any yeah\nMe too [laughter] [laughter] let me let me one day and Andrew on the phone Wendy first go ahead Wendy\nA first of all I'd like to say congratulations to everybody who has has advocated that personal five not um they just spoiled with\nUm some kind of large\nI I Want to indicate to though because I I think this has been left out that you know the city for the first time not only in moving our BTLS parcel five also indicated that they would be open to something that's supportive of the type of events that have happened to parcel five even looking at something as large as the Casey power and lights district will\nThat's what that's a that's a public gathering space where they do outdoor concerts that's actually I I Would say an endorsement of the concepts that we've been talking about for two years that that is the key to downtown so I'm actually encouraged and thankful to the administration for reconsidering um personal five is a\nA something not to be for the R B te all but actually now to be steered and pointed toward something that everyone can enjoy\nAnd here's a day and we haven't brought up this hour and it's Andy ugliness so for a while any glean is a developer who's project was assumed to be the front runner\nWhich was a residential tower with retail at I'm trying to remember it's been a little while first for second first and second I think ... office space to the office space and and a little bit more green space than we would have seen in the Morgan proposal\nSo it was kind of an amalgam and a lot of people thought that that that project was on track and all of a sudden a year and a half ago\nUh the mayor calls the news cameras and boom ... tail\nAnd I'm Mr glean has said on numerous occasions\nThat he was surprised by that and he told city news that but he has other things going on I mean going uh has glean adopting glean has a lot going on in other places does that mean that they would sort of ... up their proposal I have no idea I don't have confirmation we've reached out\nSo um so that's not clear just real briefly I'm not doing my due diligence but don't ask all of you what you thought about that proposal that that was back on the fast track or Mary\nUm well you know I remember back then leave are organizing against that proposal because it didn't have enough green space and and the location of the terrorists and they had an addict and cutting it off from really being open and accessible space actually remember the day that the ... ... project says I'm Michelle [laughter]\nI'm Talking about the city council race I'm an answer that [laughter]\nUm but you know I I think that this really is a special location and we cannot underestimate that potential that open engaged public space flexible next teams can bring to our city and to put a building and it would be at least\nSteve so I sort of differ with Mary on this actually uh personally or this doesn't represent the views of people for personal five but uh the glean is I Would say they've done a really great job investing in the midtown area and I thought that\nThat proposal while like I still wasn't in favor of rushing to building something there it was a ... a compromise and it did allow for us still actively gather there and still have a town center city center\nThat can be used by the public and they seem very willing to work with our group to make that program while\nUm but at the same time I added frontage to main street which I Know that many people a city council members wanted to create a court or a main street of buildings you know so that helps for walked ability in that way\nUm and they did have with the tower which it wasn't really clear and a lot of the imagery four and a lot of the ... but there was a court or through the or not quarter but like a\nA walk way through the middle of the tower ah where like shops and stuff faced in word in that covered court or underneath the tower that led from main street to the public space in the back and so if there had to be a building there at partial five out of the other ones that was the one that I was in favor of\nBent [noise] um yeah I mean I think looking at what the latest have done for that whole section um it's important to keep in mind that they've also purchased a building since that initial parcel of five conversation happened with the one story building next door and I'm planning to add\nTowers to that so I think at the end of the day um what's important is that\nThe space will work uh for the purposes that we stepped forward or for the day to day used but also continue to gather those larger events and concerts um but a lot of people don't know to to any Galena was involved in the decision to help bring the jazz festival downtown to begin with so I I we've had nothing but open dialogue with him you know throughout this process\nUm I'm confident that you know they would be reflective of what the community wants and needs and they're also um\nI think doing downtown a favor by gathering you know companies like that'll uh in the metropolitan and actually helping to bump up a ... a place where people can work or live downtown I always appreciate\nThe conversation ... so if your ears are burning Andy I'm going to keep calling ya I'm but who knows again a lot's changed in the year and a half and\nSo we're starting to process freshly\nTaking a look at what happened to parcel five Steve where would you send people to learn more about what you guys are parcel five dot com eight oh you are partial find on our parcel find the number five of the or the well yeah the number five hour partial five dot com if you want to learn more about that and it's a diverse not only diversity in terms of background\nSocio economic race and ethnicity diversity the summer going to say no to any building some are going to say if it's a compromise compromise but that's where part of the conversation as well have you back thank Steve thank you and your Thanks Mary Louise nice to see the thank you and bend wealth from slowed

vice president Joe Biden were founded post offices in Delaware Sophia Schmidt of member station WFDD reports are similar to eight other packages federal authorities are also investigating\nWith helicopters overhead at a postal facility in Wilmington, Delaware local and state police have joined the federal investigation of suspicious packages\nThose found early this morning we're addressed Biden's home the return address was the same as on other suspicious packages directed at prominent democratic figures and postal processing and distribution center in New castle Delaware was also investigated police swept Biden's Delaware home Wednesday when reports of the packages started to surface\nFor NPR News I'm Sophia Schmidt in Wilmington, Delaware\nPresident Donald Trump is calling for civility in light of pipe bombs that were sent to his political enemies but as NPR's Tamara Keith tells us Trump has not let up on his attacks on the media\nPresident Trump told the rally crowd he wants all sides to come together in peace and harmony but not even twelve hours later he tweeted out blame to the media\nQuote a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news former CIA director and Trump critic John Brennan who was targeted with one of the packages\nResponded on Twitter telling the president to stop blaming others and look in the mirror saying Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and encourage mental physical violence are disgraceful the package was addressed to Brennan care of CNN\nAnd networks Trump frequently attacks camera Keith NPR News\nPresident Trump appears to be following through on his threats to keep out thousands of Central American migrants who fled their home countries for the U.S\nAnd also I think you know when when we look at this sort of mega region if you will um we can't forget that although it's quite exciting to sort of see that it spans two countries uh the the contact from Canada is completely different right I'm In Toronto\nUm for example has done nothing but sort of grow over the last uh forty years and the ... in in the kind of inverse way that a city like Detroit has shrunk so are there are ways in which the kind of political boundaries also dictate differences\nI I Want to kind of move on early in the conversation from this question well maybe not maybe everyone wants to talk about this plan for the new downtown plan for the whole hour but I think let let's let's hit that and then we'll we'll broaden the theme\nSo I'm going to start by asking I guess what they make of uh the city has announced plans to move a performing arts center to link with residential\nWith retail and to put it on on the side of the river at the ... and then what I Want to do is ask\nOur guests if they think that approach makes more sense sort of a big I'm sort of ... multi hundred million dollar approach or\nDo we think of the kind of commentary that I remember from Mindy Thompson full of who came as a guest at a community designs and a few years ago\nWho made the point the boys ... it is easy to want one big ticket item on a marquee as a politician I did acts as opposed to I did a brick by brick street by street work that is less sexy is less you know advertise Abul ... so I I but let's just start with uh the project itself and all that with Raj\nIs this you know this works in beautifully to rock the river way which in a way is a is a\nIs a whole series of small and large projects are over\nTime are being created on the river\nUm which is Rochester's ... major a driver of I think for the for the future but the idea of having different scale projects going on I think is really good and so\nYou've got this project potentially and then you've got\nYou know a lot of smaller ones those are all along the way and ah over time it's all going to come together and create one magnificent whole OK Howard as you looked\nLess sold on that I ...\nI think more than reasonably skeptical\nThough you know what we're we're kind of playing musical chairs with the big theater thing and it was on personal five and now it's on main street ... but it's been a lot of places and yeah the Democratic chronicle reports Nineteen total for Nineteen okay so I'm then I'm not wrong in thinking that it seems to have been moving around quite a lot\nAnd um that suggests that maybe there's parts there's things about the proposal that have never really struck gold if if it keeps moving in hasn't nothing's happened yet and it's been happening\nIt's been moving around for a long time maybe something isn't quite right with it\nSo but anyway but if it happens fine I just think it's important for us to have reasonable expectations and um of course as Rogers correctly a told us the the rivers critical to the wellbeing of the city [noise]\nUm and so anything that we do at that site which can give us\nNew renewed and complete public ... access to the river is fabulous and if that's what this prejudice is going to do that's wonderful I think we need to be careful not to see a project like this as a any form of salvation a urban or otherwise\nUh and I would also say that uh I think I find myself among those who would love to see any public money go into this development which ah\nI'm not sure how that's going to play out but I'm not sure the short answer is if you want to play out like this I think it ... it doesn't if history is a guy if it doesn't work as a financial proposition without public money maybe that's why it hasn't happened but at any rate I I'm not anxious as a taxpayer\nTo give a lot of money to the ... registered Broadway theater leagues so [noise]\nI I don't know I'm I have mixed feelings about it\nOkay my land and so on one hand I'm very excited and I think it's incredible that the city was receptive to citizens saying hey we're not opposed to the theater necessarily but the location maybe we should reconsider and I think it's really I I like the new location\nOn but one thing that I find myself fixated on in general is just um [noise]\nWith new urbanism bringing the IDF makes use development to mainstream conversations about cities\nUm I think it loses the heart of what makes use development isn't that people say okay we're going to create this new mixed use building it's going to solve all our problems it's going to be great um but what really makes these development at the way I see it as at the heart of it is that it's organic development small things coming together and working together\nAnd it's not an exciting\nYeah it's not necessarily sexy all the time you don't get this one big thing um you have a city creating like piecing its identity together what it wants to defeat together on an eventually it well makes sense\nOkay and if it's done this way which is maybe less organic or more you know sort of pie in the sky and and I don't say that sort of derisive way but I'm so maybe a better way of saying it's just a bigger project bigger scale is that more exclusive is that less inclusive of a of a broader community I don't\nIt's exclusive very inclusive necessarily but I think sometimes that can feel imposing like whoa\nAll of a sudden we're told that this is going to be the new community center\nIs that really what the communities dealing in reality and and I guess my fear is that that's what happened with midtown and eventually it wasn't used for what it was designed for after many years and will it become the same thing if we do it again\nOkay well let's kind of then turn to a broader discussion about what Rochester does have in terms of assets to revitalize and maybe how that compares and you know Peter you when you look at 'em from the Brookings Institution and from other sources that have looked at rest of the revitalization\nA tale of two restaurants they write that some communities have assets and have advanced strategies to build on those assets I'm at now find them and their residents as as working your rights are not only participating in but actually leading the move to whether it's technology driven urbanized economy\nI'm more knowledge base they look at Pittsburgh ... Columbus Indianapolis Minneapolis Milwaukee\nThat are a little bit more economically diversified dynamic and at least starting to grow again as opposed to small and medium size factory towns that are sort of dot the the region of the rust belt\nThat maybe don't have the same kinds of assets so parts of Michigan parts of Indiana Ohio Wisconsin have lost anchor employers often a big\nFactory sort of setting employers but don't have\nA ... group plan that puts them or is it about assets is it about approach I mean I mean what's uh what charts that course do you think shore um I think they're\nUm the answer is both I'm honestly uh assets of course um play a major role in any cities development right whether it's rust belt or not um geographic off at such a connection to um waterways and natural resources and leader space\nUm and uh but I I also think that it has a lot to do with the approaches I think that in some of these more successful cases like Pittsburgh [noise]\nUm you have actually a planners and developers exercising a bit more of what Marlene and was just describing which was a kind of organic\nI'm organic form of a development or adaptive reuse for that matter I think that's an important aspect of of development that we need to talk about which is how do you actually use a lot of these are sites um which had been abandoned or which are assets by the way a unto themselves\nSo um it's a combination of you know who was who was aware when I'm\nAnd what may be better assets exist I think also frankly I'm large cities that were larger to begin with\nHave more of a shot at rebounding um Minneapolis Pittsburgh uh Indianapolis these are cities that had a already even in the industrial revolution more more of a kind of diversified or\nA or the high industrial period more of a diversified economy so so that inevitably plays a role\nUm [noise] do you want me to reflect a little bit on Rochester's asset yeah oh yeah sure I mean I think Rochester is probably sort of at the cost of of that conversation um that's my sense a\nAnd the ... the river is certainly an asset which is which is what Howard just pointed to 'em and I think the Erie Canal as an asset as well um in terms of geographic ah aspects of the city\nUm and I think actually that the the ... even if um we we know the story of Kodak of course but\nA you know with the city with the city's situation um\nAnd and that's frankly the way I I can see the the future also going and uh you know really a solving some of them and and well who's and well Rochester is smaller than it\nUsed to be as Peter has pointed out the history of what of what created the city in the first place that represents a story we tell each other about this place\nThat has a lot of currency no matter how many people are here so we we know that this is this a city that's mark been marked typically by a large grouping of highly skilled workers\nBecause that's kind of what's been here and uh there's all these kinds of ... there's these factors which it doesn't matter how big you are they they're like in our blood system that that help us to understand who we are as ... and I I don't think that this\nThe size is necessarily a I'm a gonna be a problem for us it might be an asset it I don't think it's a liability can can\nCan I also maybe try to synthesize all of the points that were just made because it's um you know Marlina point about sort of leaving being a marker of success um and should it be um and Howard the point about regions actually bring me back to the topic of the book which is\nI'm I'm tired Rogers point about origins\nUm brings me back to the point of the book which is asking us to suspend are kind of familiarity with what constitutes a region for a moment\nAnd say hey actually you know this is maybe the great lakes or your region and maybe um Toronto is actually sort of a of a friend or a neighbor of Rochester not\nSome foreign entity right and this is why it's such a pity that the fair he doesn't exist anymore\nUm but you know even a even even then when we begin to sort of think of perhaps Rochester and buffalo Toronto as a kind of super region then there's I think less of this sort of um pessimism about what you know what is here and what is not here\nI think I think that's very true and I and I note for all of us to kind of ... remember a wonderful trends have maps from around the turn of the century that showed buffalo Rochester Syracuse Toronto Utica all these cities were way more connected\nThan they are today and uh I think you know\nNot only from the point of view of employment but from the point of view of a\nOf a shared kind of narrative of a weird way doesn't mean for a lack of but this is not very scientific it does not feel that way now we do not like we're part of a super ... and there is no reason why you should actually go to Toronto does not even the others no I\nThink there's no sense that exist today that we are ... that's why I'm responding to what Peter was saying because I think Peter's encouraging us to think about ourselves as citizens of a region in the case here called big they call it the third goes but but indeed\nCitizens of a city that's connected to other cities which have a similar kind of story and we don't think of ourselves as being connected to other places in that way though clearly we should and if we did it would be an asset\n... can I get a loan can I grab some phone calls we've got some folks who want to jump in and got a really thoughtful emails as well Mike in Rochester I'll start with you go ahead Mike\n[noise] well good afternoon I just think\nThe focus on bricks and mortar murder or goes past the ... the key things which are the people Rochester one was the flower city and then they were there were the former city\nTwo different spellings we will never I've heard it said the Kodak city or the ... we had never had that part of our yell what we have had is that a dynamic population that is able to ... it's not a static\nYou know we're doing it our way in the hell with the world is changing and Rochester area in the uh are famous for being able to ...\nSad when people leave glad when they come all but it isn't necessarily build it and they will come they are here and build it\nTo satisfy them because we have like so many rust belt cities where hard work ... friendly\nDynamic with each other especially in a crisis and uh I'm hopeful and I'm Glad to hear you all talking about this\nWell Mike thank you and I think in some ways of my comments from ... remind me of the thing that had a lot of Rochester and taking out this week and that was the comments of Trevor Noah the Daily Show host\nOn Jimmy Fallon of all things and Trevor Noah said that he you know he travels a all over the country and does different events sometimes company than speaking and he says you know you you sort of forget the with the real fabric of different communities they said I'll give you an example Rochester New York\nUm and you see this as we said this week he said I'm a ... you know when you arrive in Rochester you know it's not necessarily glamorous you know you're not like blown away by you know this or that a structure or whatever but he said then you find out this is we're Frederick Douglass was from this\nThis is the suffrage movements home this is the women's suffrage movement this is historic and I just and so a lot of people were trying to I just thought they were when it was really cool but number two\nUm it made me wonder why is it that we went for decades thing where the Kodak town why isn't it number one and always number one Douglas and Anthony town I'm from what we're known for do are we to reliant on um industrial personality or or sort of economic personality why can't\nRochester be the river town of ... of what I mean seriously because of the strengths and the ... percent of that are of that body of water that runs through the middle of it which in fact a sort of began Rochester it was around the river you know in the hundred acre plot\nAnd and the high falls area where the city really began and uh\nI think that uh again the way of of of having the city and they have\nA individuals' developers and in and citizens are because the citizens over the years have been involved with through surrogates have been involved in trying to lay out their thoughts and their ideas for what\nThe river could be and so all of this is coming together\nI think and it it it could definitely be known as a as a river tone okay I'm Marlene how how do you feel about that um\nI think I'm sort of laughing to myself right now because I'm thinking of just hearing and thinking\nBack to make the comment about how we're also ... for so many things much seems almost like an ... teen in my mind like oh like you know I'm just so complicated like nobody gets any [laughter]\nBut at one point earlier I was also thinking about the connection\nBetween the idea of us being like the ... town and now there is the explorer Rochester movement which is all about taking photos of all the things that make us what we are on and there's so many pieces to that puzzle\nAnd I don't know and I haven't come to a full thought it was just something that I jotted down but that connection between Kodak and you know being the developed you know taking pictures and then Rochester exploring its identity and exploring\nWhere we want to be and what we are through taking photos which is in a lot of ways spurred the ... conversation about urban development in Rochester moving forward\nTheater yeah I mean to to my question I Would dare to sort of do something which I probably shouldn't which is a psychologist as the whole history of people giving a moniker as to the city\nUm but I think when you when you kind of a historian I'm sort of always going to go back to history when you think about the history I'm of the city developing along with the Erie Canal of the city being sort of on the frontier of western New York uh with the imperatives of hydro electric power\nThat um the ah the kind of\nTheme has always been industry right even if\nFrederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony are doing really important things that have nothing to do a you grew up in New York City right yes did you know the Douglas in Anthony from Rochester going on not until I got here and do the same thing that's I think that's what's driver knows I Can't go out and yeah I Know I mean that's my point is that I think there's a kind of\nUm a almost\nA imperative that may tide of some sort of permutations of manifest destiny that has kind of um maybe shaped the way the city has felt it has had to characterize itself a and maybe why it has overlooked other things\nI'm way late for break I've got great phone calls lined up emails to read and I'm like sort of panicking and I'm not going to be able to squeeze in and you just heard Peter Christians and\nI was a professor of art history at the University of Rochester he is moderating an event tonight it's a roundtable on rust belt urbanism you're going to ten starting at five PM at the University of Rochester and the gender rich wrestling room in Raymond the chase hall tonight\nAnd that discussions go drawn to work from the new book third coast atlas a prelude to a plan which describes conditions for urbanization around the great lakes region really great panel but Peter himself is so good that you know I'm I'm realizing has he ever goes on\nI'm not qualified to intellectually keep up with any of our guests today but they're nice enough to to let me try to Peter's here Marlina zinc Rochester resident with a background", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "city": "Rochester", "day": "25"}
