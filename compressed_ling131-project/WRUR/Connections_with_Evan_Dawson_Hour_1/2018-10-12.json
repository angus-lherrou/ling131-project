grow up with a head\nThe fall elections we've been trying to sit down with just about as many as we can of the candidates for prominent federal state and local offices\nTo solve a lot of invitations out this hour it is finally a chance to sit down with the candidate for state assembly and the one hundred thirty third just it's a district that made state wide news two years ago when the Republican in their ways came on this program and said that\nHe thought President Obama was urging black people to murder white Americans jewelry going on to win that race easily but now he's been defeated by Marjorie burns another Republican who wants to see\nBarbara bears the Democrats burns and they're joining us to talk about their views for the one hundred and thirty third district conversation and debate I'm gonna\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London Pope Francis has notified cardinal Donald Wuerl the arch bishop of Washington DC that he has accepted his offer to step down NPR's Tom Gjelten says\nWorld has been accused of helping to cover up the sex crimes have free under his supervision\nCardinal Wuerl has not himself been accused of sexual abuse unlike his predecessor in Washington Theodore matured who had to step down as a cardinal in July\nBut his bishop of Pittsburgh world built sympathetically with several priests against whom serious complaints have been made sending them for a psychological evaluation but allowing them to remain in the priesthood or approving payments to them\nIn accepting the arch bishops resignation Pope Francis noted that world could have defended himself by distinguishing between covering up crimes and committing mistakes but the world had not tried to do so\nHe has to world to remain in charge of the Washington archdiocese unto successor is named Tom Gjelten NPR News\nIt's all about ... response and recovery now in the aftermath of hurricane Michael the storm has caused massive damage particularly on the coast of Florida supplies of food and water are being brought in some by helicopter in cases where roads are still impassable\nFEMA administrator Brock Long is asking residents who evacuated to wait a bit longer to return\nQuite honestly it's a dangerous area to go back into a you know when you have this type of destruction there's gas lines that are there there's power lines that are down a and doing so you're putting your life in danger and we ask you to be patient\nSome areas saw several feet of storm surge which smashed through windows ripped off roof blew out brick walls Michael is now being blamed for Lebanon fate holidays\nHe had ten years of name recognition and\nDid some good work and people like him so I got forty three percent of the vote despite that\nI thought that was pretty good so\nI'm no one particularly congratulated and ... and I felt awful is not fun to lose but I thought I did a pretty good job in a in a set of difficult circumstances and uh this time I was just thinking well I'm going to run again\nI have name recognition I certainly know the area better and maybe we'll have a\nDiscussion of issues however that has not occurred and I think it will occur but this is a very serious issue this is what happens when one party dominates a district forever and honestly what happens is that the people who are running\nDon't really discuss the issues with the people and the people need health there's plenty of people who are working two jobs who don't have healthcare insurance who would want better educations there's plenty of people in Pittsburgh who likes to be much more involved but they're kind of indivisible so oh okay\nWell I I go ahead Margery there's just something I Want to say that a wild certainly there were allegations against Mr know Jay which ultimately a\nWe're not really brought out because of his unfortunate death [noise]\nUh and now there are allegations against um Mr regal yeah that doesn't mean that the Republican Party and that the people who live in this one hundred and thirty third district\nUm elect didn't go out of their way to find politicians and that every Republican in the Republican Party is wrong or bad\nFor electing individuals um I've lived a lifetime in the public eye both as an assistant district attorney and when I was prosecuting violent felonies and homicides\nIs Rochester city court judge elected for ten years and even his law clerk to Livingston County court judge that I worked for where every day of my life\nI saw in dealt with people and everything I did both publicly and privately reflected on people I worked for and um you know I've lived a very exemplary life\nAnd if I get elected to the spot there is no issues of corruption and you know these issues with other assemblyman whatever they are can be put behind and we start fresh and new on January first with a new era for this district\nBy ... by the way I Want to make sure it's unclear what Barbara ... yeah I I didn't mean the whole hold you know what would I mean if if if this district is willing to elect as you say the dead guy with a corruption record over any Democrat not just your wasn't personal then it's going to be a hard road for any Democrat\nWell it is a hard road for any Democrat but let me clarify a couple of things first of all\nIn the late Nineteen sixties I was a Rockefeller Republican and Lindsey Republican and it's only in the early seventies I switched parties\nAnd said a Democrat for the rest of my life second of all I think most of the Republicans ... in the district are honest decent people who are working really hard and I don't think they're well served by their elected that's number one number two\nVoting for the dead well three thousand people voted for Mr ... go and the chairs of the three counties one of ... one of which counties march you and your group to dispose of they appointed or ego\nOr they they went to his house and asked him a to join and as to Mr know Jay\nYou know I don't know why the FBI dropped a the investigation after he died I mean he had stolen millions of dollars and I'm instructed by my friends that I should not say anything\nA negative about Mr know Jay I'm not saying anything negative it's the truth so that's not right when I was in public life and I'm sure that is true for you to watch when I was in public life\nI took no more than a cup of coffee and maybe not even that and I had plenty of power that what he did was disgraceful and then ... what the Republicans would not do was to put an honest Republican and well\n... let's do it for their because I'm hearing from both candidates here that you are pledging to voters you're not going to see a repeat of the corruption that this district has unfortunately seen absolute least allegedly seen absolutely from both yes absolutely okay and on the subject of what happened\nTwo years ago on this program ... was here Joel regard was here\nAnd then making statewide news because Joao regal at the time said that President Rocco bomber was urging black Americans to kill white Americans he also told me Mr Rico told me he wouldn't go back to his old Rochester neighborhood even in an armored car because it's so dangerous I told him I visited that area with some frequency I'd be happy to take 'em down there some time he urged me to get bullet proof windows\nUp it was obviously racist statements and yet um and you have the Republican Party did not call for for Mr ... to leave that race or to give up his seat was burned should they have pressured him to step\nDown after those comments probably sell in retrospect with those ... what it is I Would say they were okay\nAnd I suspect you don't share those views no but I Do a reason I think it's relevant to return to those is I'm I'm let me just read from the Washington Post the American writer and self described a lifelong conservative Max Boot\nHas experienced a radical change of heart about the Republican Party and he just published a book called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the ripe part of that book was excerpted this week in the Washington Post and I went to court from it now he writes quote in Nineteen sixty four did GOP cease to be the party of Lincoln and became the party of southern whites\nAs I now look back with the clarity of hindsight I Am convinced that coded racial appeals had at least as much if not more to do with the electoral success of the modern Republican Party on all levels\nThan all of the domestic and foreign policy proposals crafted by well intentioned analyst like me this is what liberals have been telling me for decades I never believed them I Do now and quote that's Max Boot talking about why is leaving the Republican Party why do you agree with any of that\n[noise] I haven't read\nSupport for do you argue our digital media comes from our members\nFrom ... a small batch come butcher brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what growl are available to go on line at cat ... dot com\n[noise] what can we do about that do you think is what do you think is causing\nOh I think it's multi faceted by a by a lot of different people who are probably doing a lot to try to spur it for their own individual reasons but as far as the hundred and thirty third district\nUm I don't see it coming into play um I you know I've walked up and down all the streets of the city of Rochester when I've run for election [noise]\nUm you know I've I've walked up and down the streets in the nineteenth ward and and I'm In every other neighborhood including the neighborhoods you're referring to it and I ... I grew up in probably was and it just\nYou know I I don't see it as any issue relevant to this race because because it is and um we have a very diverse group this district goes from Pittsburgh all the way down to the city for now\nWith a lot of uh villages in hamlet and small farms in between\nAnd ... the diversity of this group both ethnically racially ... from people who are somewhat fluent in Pittsburgh\nI'm sort of defensive of the work that Albany's Sunday my summarizing correctly and can you tell me more specifically if you think the state has done a decent job on the economy in your district where has that habit\nFirst of all I don't think by a district has gotten a cut of the states uh um grants and um\nOther you know ways of help I don't think we've gotten much help because we had a assembly men in Albany some of them don't even show up on the floor but they're certainly not incredible advocates for the district and now I see what you mean about economic development I think the point I was making is that as I drive around the state\nThere is some revitalization of main streets but there needs to be a lot more so than one criticize some of the money\nSpent on economic development of course but what if the money hadn't been spent I\nI really for example buffalo is really coming back I Can't say that for the hundred and thirty third district with just recently Penn Yan\nGot ten million bucks for\nMain street development Livingston County or a hundred and thirty third did not get the money that would have been great for dance so there's a hundred things that could be done to revive the hundred and thirty third so I Would give a ...\nA net plus for state economic development could it be much better\nAbsolutely one of the last conversations with Mr know Jay that I had and I ran into him twice was he was telling me how corrupt the whole thing because he always had the negative\nSo of course there's things that are wrong but buffalo is thriving\nOkay now but I and I know most birds is going to have her time yeah I just follow up on that point by\nSome of the criticism of Buffalo's maybe buffalo was driving a certain way out is this the proper way to get up there has have there been bid rigging has there been corruption that has led to some of that are you comfortable with the Buffalo Bills and the way it's all been rolled out\nAnd if we're concerned about corruption whether your predecessors are you comfortable with what's happened in Buffalo\nNo but I Do think that a lot of it was very good but they're probably has to be more accountability uh ... in Buffalo yes and\nUm I think buffalo a was sort of an experiment could have done better yes but there are reports now that there are jobs that are now are occurring as a result of that economic development and by the way\nLet's just tell the truth here it's really hard to create a job it's a new universe\nUh manufacturers coming back a little bit but\nThe jobs are more in sort of the health industry or in apple or\nThings that are way beyond what we've had so the fact that they're actually doing solar energy\nAnd creating solar parents that's great could it be done better yes okay\nWith birds thank you I'm certainly economic development is exceedingly important and I do agree that we do need to have a lot of oversight to make sure we don't have any situation like the buffalo billion situation again\nI Would disagree though with ms fair all the statistics I saw our that manufacturing in our area has been going down our population base has been going down our jobs have been going down in one hundred and thirty third district and ah\nWhat I'm told because during the course of the primary I've been all over the district I've been down to ... and wailing that are poor and who are now up to Pittsburgh and everywhere else in between uh for months I was meeting thousands of people everywhere I could\nAnd what they were telling me and not just people in your traditional businesses but also the farmers in the small farmers is that the main problem in this district is the business climate that the taxes that are imposed on businesses\nAh is making it difficult or prohibitive\nTo have their business in New York state so that they either closer business war they move out of state and when they do that the jobs go with them or are lost and the economic a basis of all is lost because you lose your tax base\nAnd that's happening up and down this district we really need to make a concerted effort at a state level of making businesses know that they're welcome and that will do things to help them thrive\nCut taxes cut ... absolutely you agree or disagree on the\nCut regulations if they're right regulations they could be cut okay what about taxes on businesses yes a little bit and they have been cut frankly the budget for the past several years have given a tax decreases move for the middle class and for business\nSo is that enough right now if you go to Albany if you're in the seat do you go to Albany with a goal of cutting\nMy goal was Albany with the goal of helping develop the one thirty third and I was saying that the one thirty third has not gotten it's due partly because there's never been a member in the majority who could advocate it or a member who actually cares enough to have some vision\nTo say what can we do in the one thirty third that will be different for example\nThe whole recycling issue the whole issue of a plastic there's ways that we and we can't sell it now to China there's ways that we probably with a bit of intelligence could find some ways uh to to find create jobs around getting rid of a\nAn recycling plastic it needs to have some vision and some thought\nAnd that will create jobs for younger people who want to say we are losing that population absolutely and we need to have a main streets in every town\nThat are vital they're better but they're not anywhere near exciting like they could be it's a beautiful county and it could be better okay lizards\nWe have small businesses in uh in large businesses already\nUm certainly if a company moved in that would be wonderful but the businesses we currently have many of which are farmers small farmers in dairies these our current ongoing businesses\nThat are struggling and we need to help them now a ... bringing different types of businesses in would be a wonderful thing if we can do it but the priority number one is to take care of who is here now and help them survive\nAnd I've talked to the farmers especially the small dairy farmers who have about two hundred two hundred and fifty pounds\nAnd they absolutely tell me that the the taxes the regulations the lack of the business climate and also the uh um changes in the minimum wage are making it cost prohibitive for them to operate in the state\nAnd if we lose them which is our number one agriculture in the state and it's the number one uh industry it's number one industry in state and also the number one industry in this district\nThen we're going to be in a bad state of affairs those are who we need to fight for\nSo you're were raising the subject of wages were just real briefly yes\nIf you can set the wage yourself on the state level what should minimum wage be\nI'm not sure right now if we need to set a specific wage per se of I think to a certain degree the marketplace should consider the minimum wage what the market decide\nWe have a minimum wage right now right there is but as far as like for example if the minimum wage were to go up to Fifteen dollars an hour a lot of the small farmers and they've told me this\nCan't afford to make any money and pay their employees there on a march and right now\nWhere I live in Caledonia\nWe have a police officer who gets paid Eighteen dollars an hour if we really have to hire a the get the kids in the summer to mow the lawns in there somewhere employment getting paid Fifteen dollars an hour [noise]\nWhy would anyone want to be or a police officer in er an Eighteen and put their life on the line\nLinder their argument every star I mean I I that's unacceptable know first of all the minimum wage should be twelve fifty and it should go to Fifteen and people can live on that let's be real or you know people at McDonald's or now making what Fifteen dollars an hour it's still not\nEnough to have a family and then the old Rochester\nPeople had jobs in the big three companies where they could raise their family that was the middle class we lost sixty thousand of those jobs people deserve a living wage and when you look at how people live in for example New York city a and the lack of\nEquity between people who make two hundred five hundred million dollars to hundred thousand five hundred and we can't pay someone Fifteen dollars do respect I totally disagree and that's part of\nThe problem of not having the vision to bringing new industry that will pay\nBetter help me understand one thing though yeah and then all of the world back tomorrow when ms burns is saying I've talked to small businesses I've talked to farms I've talked to people who employ others their margins are thin already you take the minimum wage to Fifteen they could close absolutely are you saying that's not true\nNo I'm saying that it's part of the problem but another proud of the problem is that farmers have not been well represented in Albany I mean I Would go to Albany and get on the agricultural committee just recently as the governor and the president\nYou've got um they don't care who you vote where we're at all the time we're running out of time I got to our it's a real quick here ... emails to say what a wide ranging district did the candidates feel their district is gerrymandered and would they be open to a redrawing of the lines there going to\nRedrawn very are redrawn uh every time that there's a census and neither one of us knows in a year what this district's gonna look like but we know what it looks like now and it's great people up and down three Ninety\nOkay um so let let's have a couple of more questions have come in I'm ed wants to know where you stand with the governor looking into full legalization of marijuana I Know you don't like the up and down stuff but generally right now would you vote to legalize recreational marijuana\nAbsolutely not absolutely not I mean I agree with that [laughter] okay I have two sons [laughter] and uh I uh actually I Do not think marijuana should be legalized\nOkay Mark emails wants to know where you guys stand on the fact now I I think both of you have talked about gun ownership and your families and familiarity with firearms I think Barbara if I'm remembering correctly you have said that you don't think anyone in your family has been prevented from owning guns guns they have because of the fact that in other words is there too much emphasis on the fact that you keep it\nYes I think the say fact uh has done a ...\nHunters uh uh no harm I'm I'm a\nI Believe in the second amendment I think the say fact is fine um my sons as I've said our hunters when November comes they're all\nHappy to go hunt one of them has a concealed weapon permit we have guns in our house they're locked up and uh I respect hunters\nSo I think part of this is that there's some value that uh if you are for the same effect you don't have respect for people who hunt I have great respect for people who ...\nI and uh I I think the same effect as it is is fine now I Do want to say that the candidate for governor on a of ms burns party Mr Marlon arrow has said that he basically supports background checks and uh\nIn fact ms burns has said that ... I I I think it's a very on his comment that in reality that\nThe chances of the safe being changed at this point are but I don't think she were used the word demand and diminished but she said that it would take a change in the legislature and a change in the whole Republican Party so\nI Do not wish to make and I think this is what's happened before with Mr know Jay and a little bit with Mr ego that they say fact becomes the whole\nSort of obfuscation of the campaign and ah that's nice they made it a bogeyman with voters\n... well whatever that means yes I mean that's it you you know yes I think I think the mother out there who's worried about the health care of their kid is secondarily wants your husband to hunt and is happy if he does but she's really worried that her child or a her aunt\nOr uncle have health care a less Ninety seconds Jordan Marjorie Brandon go ahead [noise]\nThank you um if I had my druthers the same effect would be repealed\nThere are some provisions in it includes including protection for first responders that I think could stand alone and if there's other legislation that affect specific issues ah that's appropriate that could stand alone\nBut the way the safe they act is drafted a it catches a lot of responsible gun owners\nIn off things that shouldn't be affecting them ... one minute left give me an example for example or if you have a pistol if I have a pistol permit which I Do and then I decide decided in January not to renew it and just to let it go\nAnd I don't have any pistols so there's nothing illegal I just don't want a pistol permit anymore\nThe state has a right to come into my home and take the shot done that I used for skeet shooting even though I never needed a pistol permit to own a gun or to buy it in the first place they now have a right to take it\nBecause I don't want a pistol permit\nAnd the number for sports clubs in the area and I am a member of the n._r._a. and I really really do believe that if there are issues to be addressed they can be stand alone and that legislation passed in the middle of the night without anyone looking in it are evaluating it was wrong fundamentally from the beginning\nNow I Want to say we wrap up the program gym called from Rochester wants to compliment the intelligent discussion\nFrom both candidates I'm a lengthy discussion but there's a lot more on their websites on different issues they're going to be a different forums and they both were here happily they both said yes we'll be here and one of them is likely to win next month and they promised a new standard of leadership one hundred and thirty for district\n... two thousand Eighteen dot com and it burns for assembly Marjorie burns his website burns for somebody dot com Marjorie burns thanks for being a really appreciate your time pleasure and Barbara Barbara very nice to have you back to ... thank you for him a short break more connection feminine [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program is a production of W ... public radio the views express do not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without express written consent of WXXI X Y you strictly prohibited\nConnections with ...

I have seen some obituaries are just rough you know do you you can't believe what what family members would have published about people so one of the examples Milo was was kind of emailing about was an supportive family writing blatantly wrong or really just rude disrespectful obituaries\nThat essentially stripped someone of their status\nExperience an agency I mean unfortunately don't have to look very far to find this stuff so is there anything you can do about that\nAbsolutely so um you can certainly assigned somebody that you didn't see of taking care of\nUm of your property in your bodily remains and everything else but I'm actually going through the process of of pre drafting an obituary yourself is one way to do it um I actually find this to be a really exhilarating exercise I Know it sounds a little more ... and a little scary um but if you think about it it's a way for you to say in a nutshell\nWhat it is that was important to your life and what you value it and what was um what really was the core of who you are saying and three to six words even you know if you had to find yourself in that sort of a band you know who it is that you are that you want to express to the world\nUm and also using the opportunity to inspire yourself a little bit to put something in there that\nSays um you know this is when they actually want to achieve before I go so let me put it down in my obituary better get it done\nBefore it's too late president primo ... what I mean it could happen and I'm just saying um but I think you know taking that power and and creating a narrative I mean as ... people every single day we go out into a world that is generally\nBuilt to be hostile toward us right and we have to prove ourselves again and again to be worthy of rights to be worthy of love to be worthy of respect\nUm and so to take that last narrative that thing that indoors afterward gone and to put it back in our hands and have control over it is an exceedingly powerful ...\nIllegally if you do that ... can you then sort of protect yourself against somebody else publishing about you\n[noise] you know I'd have to be legal research it outright when it comes to actuaries specifically but I can tell you that if you had done what we call an appointment of an agent controlled disposition of remains then you're affirmatively saying hey\nThis is the person who I Choose to control what happens to my room and after I guy usually that bucket of legal decision making goes to what's called commonly next just can usually next if can also gets tasked\nWith ... and things like that\nOften the case that the people who work in these roles where they're saying oh yeah can you give me something I published they're turning to the same people who are in the role her contacting senior at Central director et cetera and so it's good practice to have your agents all lined up and then that way you know who's going to be that ... percent it's very likely that they're going to have some say\nOkay I'm but I think it's really smart to get out ahead of it though is Milo so yes as more but is it does seem to some of us why you think it's cool for you well\nI mean some morbid um when we so we met any of these conversations are heart rate when we're talking about a fence health directives where we're saying you know in the event that I mean could incapacitated do I want lifesaving treatment\nAt what point do I want lifesaving treatment and then we moved toward um you know ... to care and pain management um and that sort of thing all of these things are difficult conversations nobody wants to think about these worst case scenarios\nUm but it's so crucially important that we do it um and the truth is a unless you're a robot we're all gonna die it's at some point it's an inevitability death and taxes right those are the two certainty as we have in life [noise]\nUm so what an exhilarating exercise it is to take control over those last days weeks years of your life to take control over the narrative to take control over exactly\nHow you want things to go in those last days so that you can ensure that you were a respected 'em all the way up until the end um and I think that you can actually ensure that sort of respect\nAh um ironically in that way more so sometimes and you can when you when you aren't incapacitation so up\nNext on the list trends folks who are forcefully deep transition to shore by healthcare providers or an support a family in a hospital setting in hospice nursing homes\nEven at a funeral [noise] um [noise] and my little and we say de transitioned mhm um I obviously I think people have certain ideas on what that means but that can mean different things in different settings to tell us what you mean\nSo I think it's a really broad term that really captures any situation where a person's gender identity and gender expression is not going to be respected and um [noise] uh maintained by health care providers are families over the course of treatment\nSo the way that this often will play out let's just say I'm you know we have maybe an unmarried transgender woman who has a partner a lifetime partner but they're not married\nI'm and she has a condition or isn't an accident that renders her incapacitated she finds herself in the hospital the partner may or may not have um healthcare proxy are made to be an agent and have decision making power she may not even be able to visit\nHer partner in the hospital um and you know next of kin is cold and so maybe we have a mother or siblings who have been strange for years who are not supportive of her trans identity call to make decisions\nUm and you know use that opportunity to\nAh enforce their own views of who this person is and effectively you know strip them of any of the the gender expression that allowed them to be who they truly were um reverted back to using a name they no longer use their debt name 'em and and just really make it so that they're not able to die\nWith the dignity and respect that they deserve um and then carrying that over into funerals and so on and so forth and know that some states including California passed legislation that specifically make sure that people are able to die with dignity in this way and the other death certificates will be authentically reflective of the gender identity that they had when they died\nUm so to try to curb that I'm ability of of an support a family to strip them of that dignity\nAfter it I ...\nI just want to take a left turn for a second and talk about life because I Know we're talking about that a lot I think another lens to view this there is that this is an expression of your values in life especially after you do the power of attorney\nPower of attorney is such a powerful tool to be able to say if I don't feel well if I just don't feel like here's this person who I trust here's this intimacy that I'm getting to someone in my life my choosing so that they can handle my affairs for me and that's a document that lives and dies with you so it is\nA during your lifetime sort of a thing and it's the intersection of so many things as an expression of cultural or religious values it's it's an expression of inclusion for people of varying disabilities so it's not just how are we going to die which is an important to talk about we want to lift that taboo if we can but there's\nThere's so much to thinking about the different documents we get the health care proxy lives with you guys with you\nPower of attorney lives if you die that this is about your life an expression of the kind of like you want similarly to the way that we express ourselves in so many ways on and say we just want to kind of put that peace and ... and on but not to take the focus ... transitioning and that can be a thing that happens in the hospital when you're temporarily sack right\nLet's say you have a surgery and you're going to recover\nBut for now you're incapacitated you don't want to have to be put through something against your well because you didn't do a piece of paper sign a form of\n'em and you can even in in those circumstances to be you know a book who you're ruined with when you're in the hospital for a period of time if your identity documents have not um an amended to reflect your a gender identity\nUm sometimes medical professionals will put you in a room with somebody of a sex that you don't identify with and so now you're in a\nStrange situation where you're having to be out it or or come out to medical professionals and\nUm you know especially when the vast majority of trans people have mismatch in government identity a documents that don't all accurately reflect how they are um having these sort of a protections in place and making sure there's a healthcare proxy who can say\nA an agent who can say no this is where they belong this is how they identify and we need to be sure to respect to maintain that dignity is hugely important\nOn the subject of of documents identifying um are we seeing change their ... and are we seeing\nChange in the way that say medical staff hospital staff in an emergency situation we're not now we're not talking about sort of a long term care facility for nursing homes or or like facilities now we're talking about emergency medical situations or are we seeing progress in the hospital for for for trends America\nSure sure um yes and no I think it depends on where you are um the likelihood of finding a um an affirming emergency room stuff in more urban areas is higher than in more rural regions and especially in New York state which is largely rural ah this is an issue an ongoing issue for a lot of people\nUm statistically ... people are more likely to utilize emergency rooms as ... as primary care of when they were really sick they also are more likely to postpone seeking care at all when they're sick because they're afraid of biased\nUm and so the emergency rooms are actually a really great place to start when thinking about this um the the reality is when a person's um gender expression does not match the identity documents they have or the medical records they have\nIt was talking about exactly what the procedure would entail talking in detail about things that I could do for after two better achieved the results that we were looking for talking about concerns do you have any questions you can contact me afterward and that's the difference\nIs when those situations occur\nIt's a pretty clear indicator that that level of care in terms of differentiation is there\nAnd it was very much the case in that situation where when I went to another office where the treatment very different in terms of how I was respected mhm it was also very different in terms of the level of treatment that was being offered and the level of attention to respecting somebody as a person and really meeting their medical needs you ended\nUp ... I just want to take an opportunity to point out that I'm a ... it's important I think for folks who are listening who might identify with with any us talking about her experience something sort of similar and just to remind folks that\nUm there are really good protections under state and federal law for situations like this this is that okay uh I'm ... under under federal law under the Affordable CARE Act which is often known as Obamacare um there is a non discrimination provision that's still in place despite best efforts ministry since and not make it so\nUm that prohibit ah hospitals and health care facilities or who's receive federal funding which is the vast majority of them\nI'm from discriminating against people based on their sex including trends down is um and under state law or human rights law very clearly protects people based on Trent status gender identity gender expression and sexual orientation\nAs well as the disability of tundra does for you um if you identify as having that in places a public accommodation which include hospitals doctors' offices and emergency rooms so just as a way that that is\nYeah and it's absolutely good information to have I think the ... is that a lot of the time the situation is more immediate than the remedy is of course so you can definitely follow up with those sorts of things but having things like advanced directives in place how to avoid getting into those situations particularly when it comes to replace him saying\nI have experience with this practitioner like for instance inpatient mental health care if you know other facility or you know that a facility has that record\nYou can avoid things like being denied treatment while you're in care for a different condition by saying I don't want to be treated by the facility or when I'm In a facility this is what I expect in terms of care\nWhen you go to medical facilities now do you have more of an expectation that things will be appropriate or more of an expectation that you'd better be prepared for things to be not there yet\nI think for a lot of folks in my position and similar positions there's always a kind of assume the worst and hope for the best scenario and it's I've had some great experiences I've had actually a practitioner call after a visit and apologize from is generally me in that case I hadn't even noticed it\nThe office and is it and they kind of follow it up and we're like dairy side this happened I just didn't like I hadn't corrected them but they acknowledge like even though you didn't correct me I don't know if you noticed it I don't know if it was hurtful to you and I want to apologize if it was\n... what does it mean to you is that helpful yeah it's absolutely helpful because I had I noticed it again I probably wouldn't have said anything I didn't say anything directly to the person the other case either but by somebody following up it kind of split the difference between the expectation that this person doesn't really understand my needs\nBecause they are actually saying I made a mistake and I'm apologizing for it and I understand that it was inappropriate\n[noise] well I'm a late for our only break in the hour let's get that break and we're going to come back and some of the things you've been hearing about advance directives Danny brought up a legal documents we've got a couple of attorneys here we can I ask how you actually get those documents what it actually\nTakes we we've talked about what it means to start thinking about putting together kind of a frame for an obituary in where you might be able to keep those who ... who you might want to be in touch with about about these things all things that\nA lot of good information for everybody but in particular the ... plus community this is not just an elder care fair tomorrow it is really something it's it's a life fair for people in the ... plus community so let's get that break and continue the conversation next I connections\nI'm I've been to Austin Monday on the next connection vi BCC is out with its new report on climate change and it is dark scientists are saying\nWe are closer than ever to catastrophic climate change and many of the estimates have been too conservative other words some grim times ahead of we don't make significant\nChanges so what kinds of changes do we need to make we discussed among [noise]\nOn the next fresh air filmmaker and writer John Waters a new retrospective of his art photographs and more as a Baltimore museum of art his movies including swimming does and hairspray\nI always like the villain I Love the stepmother I Love the wicked whereas a fellow at all my movies really there is no such thing as a villain ... joined us [noise]\nTonight is seven walking back to connections\nThe U.S and I think Danny Palmer talking about his experience in the medical setting now as someone who while you're not an elder elder yet by technical definition I don't think [laughter]\nThat is pretty young I'm I'm and I think that's emblematic of what the point kitty out of me this was making earlier about there's an elder law fair tomorrow get ahead of things if you've got questions if you've got concerns of what may be happening now in your life ... and certainly in the future but I opened the program by talking about\nThis film that I think is is really worth finding if you can it's called ... silent about seven or eight years old now a documentary film\nFollowing the lives of half a dozen ... plus seniors\nAnd revealing how difficult they're either they're legal situations or interactions with nursing homes and in related facilities can be and touching on the fact that that gay people who have felt people in the ... plus community who have\nSort of come through this generation come\nOut of the closet are at times be choosing to deny their own identity just make sure they can get care just make sure they can stay in certain settings et cetera on I'm going to assume my lawn Katie that if you are in a nursing home if you're in assisted care facility\nYou've got all kinds of rights that they should not be able to take away from you but let's talk a little bit about that but maybe you know an older gay couple maybe you know a a a single gay person who again we know that they live in isolation more for for various reasons um first of all I I'm going to assume they cannot\nTried to counsel you anyway and the same way that we don't uh that were this country is slowly moving away from the um uh praying the gateway and related services\nThat do all this kind of harm I assume that facilities can't really do that legally ... tried to counsel you out of your own identity et cetera\nThat's right okay [laughter] yes I'm a again under federal law that sort of thing is is not allowed I'm In the vast majority of these facilities receive some sort of federal funding I mean if they accept Medicare which most of them do that's what that's their life blood\nUm they are are bound by federal law not to discriminate against people in those housing situations and healthcare\nUm situations in a nursing home facilities assisted living that sort of thing um they have to respect your sexual orientation and gender identity exactly as as\nUm do they always follow the law no and I think that that's a huge problem and um people's choice to stay silent about their identities for fear of bias for fear of neglect an elder abuse and neglect\nUm is enormous um folks in that generation of the baby boomers we're entering the facilities are statistically less likely to have supportive family members who are keeping an eye on them to make sure that they're being treated with respect and being treated well\nI'm an also are less likely to have um children or grandchildren who are visiting a horse supportive so it really it's a very vulnerable part of our community\nThat even short of that um before going into assisted living or nursing homes um ... uh access to a um equitable and save housing for um Elgin ... elders period is actually a big issue um when can be done about that\nThat's a good question um it's a it's something that community center as well to be too cute community centers are trying to tackle I'm across the state I Know here in Rochester the auto alliance has a very very active sage program\nA which is meant to target aging an elder ultra ... folks in the local area provide regular programming um that they're they're constantly doing great programming crude including free lunches uh euchre uh tournaments and I think yoga for folks [laughter] which is great um but I think that\nAre providing that sense of community and networking and resources for that for that a group of folks is really key um the ticking that's the next level and making sure that we have appropriate and safe housing options for folks who is also hugely important\nKidney to a documentary film touched on how discrimination sometimes is very overt I mean literally staff members trying to counsel a council to gay out of people or you know that these things that are just sort of horrifying and obvious\nBut then there's discrimination that may happen among other residents I'm staff members doing things that are ... will make life a little more uncomfortable or et cetera that may not meet certain threshold and I wonder what recourse people ought to know about or or having those situations", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "12"}
