opportunities for boys and young men of color [noise] that's true across the country that is certainly true here in Rochester Rochester graduation rate\nRanks laughed in the big five cities in the state to be known that for a long time\nAnd when it comes to boys and young men of color some of the numbers have been misleading I mean the numbers aren't quite as low as maybe you've heard reported in various places they're low and certainly we need more boys and young men of color to graduate to go on to college to go on to successful careers so what does culturally responsible teaching\nLook what should change upcoming summit boys and men of color education is so we're going to talk all about talking about solutions\nLie from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi sang Sandra Day O'Connor the

collected from the census undo along NPR News New York\nAll right so I'm sure to be a lot more to say about that in the months to come so let's set that aside now and let me let me bring it back to Dr Wilson's start right here with what's going on this weekend and\nWhat the focus is so why don't you tell our audience how this came together Dr Willis and then if they want to still get involved how they can\nDo that certainly um I received a call or roughly two months ago from a friend of mine who's a Rochester native and who um is just intimately concerned about what's going on with the plight of young people in Rochester specifically are young boys um she runs the national organization madam CJ Walker legacy\nMissed Natalie Cole field um but she wanted to do something specifically for young voice here in Rochester and having boots on the ground specifically a underneath the umbrella of a African American studies within the rational city school district I knew I had the touches and I knew I had the ability to be able to do some of the things that that we both in vision\nOf what was really a blessing for me that when I made the phone calls and I called people that I have relationships with\nUm that I value as friends that I really believe have student first pedagogy mine states that are embedded in their day to day work process and in their lives or to a man ... into a woman each was able to show up for this day which is very unique for me\nEven a doctor announced tucked before his his trip to Israel\nA is making time and you know we have a community a issue going on right now right the state of our young people in the city of Rochester is something that we should all be concerned about and what I Want to do a as captured that energy in the room that day provide positive opportunities for mentor ship\nHave young folks and and administrators faculty teachers to see the veneer of young brothers of color that are already in positions and that have the ability to make things better for children I'm Lesley\nYou know um we can go to W. W. W.\nDot R. O. C. B. M. O. C. summit su M. M. I. T.\nDot splashed that dot com and you can register their free for the community we still have plenty of spaces open so feel free to come on down on Saturday fifty two fifty seven west Henrietta wrote all righty in and convention center\nI'm In a conference center excuse me so\nUh we're excited about the program on Saturday\nOr and and for less those are just heard the website will make sure we posted on our various platforms if you want to check out the registration form it is on Saturday and before the program began another important point that I think we should probably keep hitting is there is a there's probably crisis is probably not too strong a word for the for the situation for\nBoys and young men of color in terms of educational fulfillment graduation et cetera however\nThere's a number you often hear trotted out in this community and it's wrong you often hear nine or ten percent of of young men of color graduate from high school\nAnd in the Rochester city school district and Dr ... was just explaining before the program began that that number is Ron ... the number isn't isn't what anybody wants it to be but it's not nine percent or ten percent\nThat is correct the shop report in twenty twelve issued a report in which to nine percent African American males and eleven percent spending miles um that was cited as the graduation rates\nThere was a correction me by the shop report um provided the inaccurate information or narrative that was shared across the community and I think there were district officials and\nProfessionals that clarify that data um but the point being made that there is a crisis is still something that is very\nProminent in prevalent as it relates to the working which we're attempting to do or dress with the summit um even with the correction and wants to Rochester was one of the communities that have the least or had to leave graduation rate amongst African American males in the country so even with the correction um it did not necessarily in prove\nI'm standing just standing where the narrative um that Rochester is in dire need of ...\nAnd what is the number I mean is roughly what high twenties something like that\nI think at this point I wouldn't be the best person to speak to that um especially um considering that this was a correction made to the twenty twelve\n... mhm yeah but but but just listeners if you hear a percent ... percent ... percent that it's not true um it's still a problem ... or so let's let's do this\nLet's ask all of our guests to share their insight into why they think that's happening here and then we'll we'll talk specifically about what's coming up at the summit and as we go throughout the program if you want to communicate with us\nAs we are talking about educational opportunities and success for young men and boys of color especially in the Rochester city school district it's eight four four to nine five talk that's toll free aid for four to nine five eight to five five\nTo six three to be a ... year in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for you can email the program connections that W ... or Dr ... there's not one simple single reason but when we talk about low graduation rates for young men of color what stands out why it's happening\nI can speak about my most recent experience with the east Hi project and punish the University of Rochester and we began that project by surveying the community um the parents students and staff identify\nSome of the academic and social barriers that exist at a four hour all of our students particularly our students of color\nAnd what we live with students said is that there's a disconnect between those north already and um them as they move to navigate through the um through high school and through middle school and so we restructured our school to provide adequate socio emotional support like through counselors and social workers and community organizations\nThat allowed us to restore relationships between among the adults in the system and how they interact with students so so step one was to make school and inviting place socially emotionally for students\nAnd then step to was to redesign curriculum in ways that engage students so they saw themselves as relevant and the materials and also to allow them to have um a meaningful discourse between themselves and between them and the staff\nYou know we got to forty in that you are meeting August a graduation and and the most recent graduation numbers sixty one percent\nSo we nearly in proved our graduation rate by twenty eight percentage points which I think\nIs not unheard of if you have the right systems and structures um that respond to what students' parents community and staff I'm a demand a lot of that work was done by empowering teachers to again redesign curriculum to instruct anyways that's meaningful to themselves into the students\nAnd to take the pressure of standardized tests off the table you know that's a measure a measure of success but the work that we've done in trying to predict are trajectories has been much more meaningful data to use within the school\nSo so I I don't think the graduation issue is problematic I think sustaining it becomes the next challenge and that's the work that we're doing now and trying to create a model that hopefully is being used replicate it um or modify another school system and I'm excited they are our school systems that are all over the country that reached out\nUm to ask what we're doing and to see how they can modify it and and revise it based on their on their own local context\nSo east as a school in Rochester has its own context and I think that the changes in which on the occurred there was based on information we got from that context\nI think those things can be and should be replicated across I'm not just Rochester but across the state and that was the intent of this program ... east was a school that has failed and um this project was to incubate and to find out how we could redesign the school system and meaningful ways that can be replicated or modified throughout the city\nOne more point before I turn to your colleagues because I I I think this really deserves a little more stress an emphasis which is\nWhen you say what you discovered was it wasn't the workers to rigorously is it it was sort of irrelevant to the students a list I think I'm hearing you correctly and in my own mind that can try to figure out what that means that I've got some assumptions can you be a little more specific about what you mean so I think there's a couple\nBut at the system in which they left\n[noise] All right to the conversation is our is about an upcoming summit you just heard Jason Willis mentioned Dr Willis is director of African American studies at the Rochester city school district\nAnd the event as the boys and men of color education summit this Saturday the twenty seventh seventh of October starting a day it am at the R. I. T. in and convention center\nAnd they're still opportunities for those in the humidity who want to attend after our only break in the hour we'll come back and remind you well Dr well says there's open space do you want with students there do you want more parents there you don't work teachers there so we're gonna talk about\nWho else it's aimed at if there is still open space so I Want to jump on line will put on our various platforms and opportunity for you to do some I'll read some of the the feedback we've been getting and we continue the conversation about educational opportunity and success\nFor young men and boys of color especially in our city has to get that next\n\nComing up in our second hour we invite Paul candidates for governor to join us on connection before the election and after they officially declared\nCandidates these you've heard from the libertarian and the Green Party candidate today it's independent candidates Stephanie mine she's a Democrat who served as the mayor of Syracuse for eight years for term limits required her to leave that office now she wants to be governor to Stephanie minor next hour about for plans for Albany [noise]\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from energy mark providing locally produced natural gas and electricity to western New York homes and businesses\nEnergy Mart offers custom energy supply plans and budget management strategies with full rate trends parents see more at energy mark L. L. C. dot com\nAnd the next ... voting rights and voting restrictions we talked with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot has twenty four states have implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nRanging from requiring voter id is to closing polling places also tell us about the seven states wherever they are being made to expand voting rights joining\nOne\nTonight at seven welcome back to connections I'm Evan Johnson Andrew emails the program to say and then your guests are saying that much of the educational material for young black men if not relevant to them not to their lives not to their cultures at least that's the way I'm hearing it\nBut you have black men on your panel who assuming they went to school maybe in Rochester I don't know where they grew up\nGraduated and succeeded in spite of that can they addressed that disparity that's from Andrew okay Andrew thank you Dr ... want to start\nYou sure we're talking about the exception to the rule when I actually graduated from the city school district I was actually ill prepared I did attend the University of buffalo and much of relived experienced that allow for me to navigate um\nThe the college experience but [noise]\nUm I I I Will say that people often use that argument if one person ... everyone can do they use the exception\nAs if it's the rule when in reality structurally systemically there's a significant amount of work that needs to happen in order to ensure that there are other individuals that may have the experience and went off the next question what happened that allow you to be successful so many of the sea others not to be successful and if I were to be one hundred percent candy\nI Would say I just didn't get caught is not that I didn't I wasn't exposed or things couldn't change and I could have actually went less as opposed to write but the reality is one of many docked rocks in our community that do not have the nurturing the nursing they do not have the support\nAnd I'm even written off as a professional and just imagine those young person's you do aspire to be I'm a doctor Brock a doctor will is a doctor gnomes\nWhat obstacles we had to overcome in order to be where we are so it's one thing to see the outcome but it's another to understand the process it took for us to be here in so many others that didn't\nThey weren't able to make it through that particular trajectory\nYeah I I I Can't tell you or I echo those those sentiments are completely um\nI I Would also say that um my my spirit wasn't prepared my cultural identity wasn't prepared when I moved and when I went to college even though I'm a Rochester native\nEven though I went to Sunni Rockport there were pieces of my spirit that uh were absent right I I never I never had an African American male teacher I never had a exposure to Christmas addicts or Benjamin Banneker or methodologies behind\nI'm ancient African civilization that has sustainability over thousands of years\nWe could teach our young folks fertile crescent in ancient Mesopotamia or we can teach our young folks fertile crescent for not river civilization grounds you know how well to harvest the crops\nPeople and cultural trends a cultural diffusion ... and transmission of information so on and so forth so you know we just need to be careful as educators right how it is that we protect the spirits of our young folks and give them the Protestant base\nThat they can possibly have in order to effectively navigate those things that we already know are in place to set them back or to filter them out\n... ... it's interesting I'm Nineteen oh to a doctor who introduced this concept called the looking glass self theory and its development of oneself and one's identity through once in a personal interactions with the context of society\nAnd I think that you know it's one place to navigate and be successful in society and still not see yourself as part of that society and I know when I've spoken with Dr Willis and Dr Bracken in the personal conversations we both experience that even as professionals that we question\nIf society really accepts as part of that society or if we are the exception to my my child my children to go see 'em they hit you give this past weekend and within that movie you see um the main character star try to navigate to see 'em what society she fits in\nAnd so not only do we have struggles with students of color who are in poverty but even when they make it society may not be ready for their success and so this weekend's um conversation\nWell not only give students and teachers in the community the pathway a path will not be but a pathway towards academic and social success but a lawful allow them to be around individuals who are still seeking their self identity in in society even as adults\nAnd often our energy comes from kids navigating those same challenges and it puts pressure on those adults in her room to be articulate and be passionate and be persistent about redefining the identity that that society expects of us from us\nSo so I'm constantly thinking about um how do I learn from the youth so that they're not in their forties and fifties still seeking identity with in this society because there's so many faces masked we have to where we are talking about this off off the air\nTheir days you walk through society you have a face of husband father Dr ... the people you grew up with the community\nThe folks who see you in the newspaper who really don't understand you the people who truly understand [laughter] and sometimes you forget was facial wearing and so as we convened this this week can we talk about how leaders can launch boys and men of color and being into the next phase\nEyes self identity and couldn't decide to identity becomes really important and I'm excited that this week in provide these young folks as well as the older individuals an opportunity to start redefining their own self identity but more importantly\nTo have society understand ... who are doing these are without us jeopardizing the changing them for society\nDr Willerslev they're open seats who do you want to fill those seats\nEvery one that has a vested interest and what's going on state of affairs if you have a an idea you think you know how to fix the problem we watch it a parking lot that idea\nBecause we want to make sure that the energy that we capture and everyone was part of the collective conscious it's all of us in the rock talking about the rock and the kids that are going to the school systems in Iraq\nBecause we love the rock right and everybody there is there a pro bono with the exception of a doctor Patterson who's been gracious enough to come from Georgetown University\nSo I just say you know these are people who are in positions\nTo have touches on the lives of children to make very actionable items for children I trust these brothers that I Know are representative on this panel and on all of these panels and throughout this program\nCalled these people personally because we already have a relationship and I'm thankful for those that relationship and I'm thankful for them stepping up if I may I'm incredibly thankful to endless highways\nFirst capital payments and processing rushed to community foundation star bridge parent alignment and platinum auto world for their support throughout the course that has a\nVenture I couldn't help but notice Dr bracket you said that even now in your professional and you know you're trying to be I think straight with us as you could be about your background where were your the path in life but even now you can be disparate dismiss it in your professional setting\nAbsolutely absolutely I think I'm a sense of concept something I'm very\nAware I'm as an individual but I'm also cognizant that others may not necessarily proceed me in a way I perceive myself and I give you three examples\nUm people may see me in different context in and think that um either I'm aggressive or I Am volatile hostile because I'm not necessarily for so because I Am assertive as it relates to does usually give permission data\nSecond is individuals may dismiss you because they feel like the only way that you're in the room is because you are on the token I sign to get something done versus ... for the qualities and the qualifications and you know your value added to the context in what it is it in third um we're still rarity ruins in which we occupy\nWe have mastered teaching right we need master educating we need the ability to reach the child where they're at and their experience\nAnd if it's the arc we teach the arc of a jump shot and then we take 'em to mount hope bridge which is the science behind the stability of art you know we do it within the context of the things that are ... for our kids that that we know that they go to that they turn to\nSo let me just asking the remaining minutes Dr Willis brought up Christmas addicts I I if I recall correctly\nI remember so I ... I went to mostly white district outside Cleveland\nSecond grade miss van meter had been memorizing lines about Christmas addicts and yet\nI said last week on this program\nI don't want to date my ... school district but I don't remember ever hearing the words Thurgood Marshall ... when I was in school you know so so ... there's a lot of holes number one in education to begin with for for all kids right but then when you think about when you think about who's doing the educating we brought this up in the program before but when Dr ... says\nYou've got parents who don't trust the system even if they are as Dr rock points that even as they are the exception of the rule\nAnd they have sort of pushed beyond the boundaries that society's sort of created they still don't trust the system and you're dealing with that I think you know that's a good reminded everybody that you do need representation in the classroom in administrators the higher up you go you needed everywhere\nAnd so are we any more optimistic today that we can attract and help cultivate more African American men to teach\nI I Am optimistic that this community\nAnd maybe it's because of the political environment that we're in that this community is now opening their eyes and not conveniently hiding behind their lack of knowledge or ignorance in in the past you heard people say well I just didn't know or I understand in and you know\nThere had to be a reason I mean I think this political environment has really forced us all to open our eyes have thoughtful conversations this feels like a living room conversation and this is what we this is what it used to be we had communities where people can to every have discourse and agree to disagree\nYou see social media is actually bridging the geographic boundaries that exist you know what I'm what I'm arguing on Facebook or Twitter is what people from all over this county in this country that's a good thing if a dumb respectfully so so I'm optimistic that we have teachers who don't want it can ignore the realities of our students and their\nTheir requirement to make sure we are serving kids meaningfully that no longer to be ignored and nothing with that as we graduate more men of color from high schools then we'll have more men of color who might choose to enter the field of education\nAnd just thought a plug I'm actually graduated from east and there was a very effective program there still exist today to teaching and learning Institute in the primary person for tea ally with the help cultivate teachers of color\nAnd me being one of the first graduates of tea ally and a dollar hundreds of doing a really great job even to this day so although I wasn't I wasn't as prepared as I needed to be how to not go through or went to the program I probably would have been accepted into college let alone prepared\nTo participate at you know with the level of rigor that college I'm providing so there are programs there are some pockets of sauce and ... just have to build up ... here because I Am with you I grab them each side grass\nAnd um that encouraged me even though I didn't take the the the tradition of teaching wrote I I Do consider myself an educator in some sense of\nThe word right a duck to go into an area\nThat I just wanted to say I'm going back to what you said about the curriculum needing to be more comprehensive for all children for all students\nI'm advocating that it is reflective of the truth\nNot only ... stories or omitting different people in history\nUm inventors um writers authors but make it a comprehensive curriculum that reflects a more\nA truthful um societal contributions right contributions from everyone and I think that everybody will benefit because I don't believe many of our teachers\nHave learned some of the things that you just mentioned a Avon and Dr um well is that they they haven't learnt themselves that hasn't been part of their high school um curriculum known ... nor has it been part of their pre service in college so the challenge for us is to make sure that teachers know\n'em and understand I'm more\nFully what the historical context is\nWell it's been remarkable conversation is our I Know they've got a big day planned\nFor Saturday there still seats and and slots available I should say so this Saturday starting in ... the R.

G disappeared and assemble in Turkey said there was evidence Saudi Arabia hadn't killed many Americans pulled out of the conference including the CEOs of black rock and J. P. Morgan Chase and treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin\nBut there's still a crowd gathered in Riyadh including business leaders and heads of state Saudi Arabia says it's signing fifty billion dollars worth of deals on the first day of the three day conference mostly through the state oil company\nAnd appearance by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was greeted with applause he told reporters the event was going well with quote more people more money ... NPR News\nOn multiple factors are playing into sharp declines of this hour on the major market indices down down three hundred and fifty three points or one point one percent the S. and peaceful in one point one percent and the NASDAQ is down more than one percent is well it's Seventy three eighty five\nAnd the years you can go she says the decline comes on the heels of volatile trading and Asian markets\nConcern over a slowdown in Chinese economic growth as well as increased global tensions between the U.S in Saudi Arabia over the death of journalists democracy oh gee are making for jittery markets\nAnd that she can automatically get into non traditional news sources as well as traditional news sources\nSo the reason you saw and heard more of her at least initially is because she was a kind of an interesting a candidate a celebrity albeit one who was very committed to public education and other issues\nShe is I'm On a a a political spectrum you know she called herself a democratic socialist I Would not call myself a democratic socialist a much more\nUp in the middle you know I'm much more pragmatic and I think that comes directly from running a city which meant I had to figure out how to pay the firefighters and the police and get the snow plow to make sure that the water came on and balance the budget every year and understand\nThat you can't uh continue to raise taxes on some of the poorest people in the nation actually in some our census tracks that you had to figure out the problems are solved when you convene people together and that you should not lead with are you a Democrat or Republican or independent or your Green Party\nSo let me ask you a question about the Democratic party than because you're running as independent and you're asking me entire electorate to evaluate you you're not running in a primary but I Do want to get your take on this sort of the state of the Democratic party and ... had to say about that just I think the day after\nThe primary last month so I Want to listen to some of those comments that he made in which you know reporters were saying\nUh you want to pretty resounding victory over Cynthia Nixon but we're all sort of time where Andrew Gillum wins the primary in Florida for governor of design your Ocasio Cortez there are a number of other candidates who are either self described democratic socialist or embrace moving the party leftward on those issues and the governor essentially said\nI'm no that's a myth let's listen\nThere was a misinterpretation of what happened in the congressional primaries decreed rational primaries\nOr the way the calendar war\nBetween the federal election cow in during the state election calendar victory rational primaries were basically the only election on that day\nAnd that drop that turn out to a very very low love New York Democrat is these are hard working\nMen and women in middle class working families they are real problems and they need real help in life\nAnd they don't need theoretical or abstract solutions very real solutions in their life\nAnd you know when we're done in New York We're provided real\nSolutions in their lives\nResults for people\nOur number one do you agree with him in that much of the hype around a vendor Ocasio Cortez democratic social ... socialism et cetera was\nMistaken for for being smaller than it is within that party within the Democratic but I think that that is the jury is still out on that Evan I think that that's a discussion\nThat everybody in one way or another in our country is going through whether you talk about an issue of health care health care is the most important issue\nThat we're seeing across the country and how do you answer that question of how do you give people health care that they can afford and as high quality what's the party that's going to ... an answer to that and what you've seen is Donald Trump said I'm going to give you a beautiful health care\nWith one hand and on the other hand they a house of representatives and the Republicans in Congress have taken it away\nThe Democrats are saying we're going to give you health care for all and when you say well how are you going to pay for it there's a there's a little bit there's not a real yet answer to that so I think that we are in a tremendous moment of political\nFlux and both ah everybody's trying to answer these questions but what I Will tell you is I what I have found deeply disheartening is that there is not been a seriousness of purpose in answering these these questions particularly by executives and I would hold Andrew Cuomo accountable for that I agree with him that\nDemocrats a New Yorkers are hardworking people who want their problem solved and what Andrew Cuomo was able to do was he took twenty six million dollars\nAnd what he said is repudiate the status quo and I'm not the status quo Donald Trump is the status quo was clever was a it was smart politics but it um it's gonna it's gonna be like a a a a cotton candy high\nBecause all we have to do is look around and say here in the city of Rochester has Andrew Cuomo\nUp and held accountable for the failure of education policy to graduate more students from the Rochester city schools and what is Andrew Cuomo said in this election year that is going to change that unfortunate trajectory for those students\nAnd there's been a million people who have left New York state in the past eight years more than any other state of crisis of opportunity upstate a crisis of affordability downstate what his he and his team done\nTo try to change that trajectory he spent twenty seven billion dollars on economic development upstate projects that were mired in corruption that had been found to be completely and totally ineffective again here in\nMonroe County just look at canal ponds looking all the announcements that they had their and right now it's an empty facility that New York state is paying rent on\nWell let's go issued by the Utah healthcare so let's do healthcare here you see problems with the way both parties have presented their position on healthcare one being less realistic about the cost and one actually taking healthcare away from people so\nWhat happens is Stephanie minor is the governor of New York state and you're trying to bring that pragmatic realistic approach to the costs but also wanting to increase access and quality well well\nI think what we have to do is say that the uh all localities all counties outside of metropolitan New York the state has to do over five year period pick up the local share\nThat counties pay for Medicaid so that we can equalize a property\nA ... a lot of money it is it's about two billion two and a half billion dollars if you include New York city and it's eight million dollars so we can do that over a hard cap which means taking the service providers and saying you all have to live under this cat and we have to realize that when we're paying in New York state Seventy six percent more\nFor Medicaid and Medicare than our ... other states in the country that that's not sustainable so we have to look at work with our service providers look at our medical redesigned teams and look at the services we provide and figure out how we can do it more efficiently more effectively and understand that there's a real cost to these\n... and then long term the best system that is affordable sustainable for the state is what\nIs to have a single payer system where the federal government overseeing that what's that going to require on the federal level that's well that's what that's going to require on the federal level is that there's going to have to be a a decision about how we can do this and pay 'em and pay the bills\nBut on a long term basis it I don't think as of yet based on the research that I've seen and the other states have tried it\nThat we can't have single payer state by state by state and what we're seeing is people are drowning under the costs of health care\nUm both ah both employers and participants in the ... we have to address this and we have to realize that there is no such thing as free health care\nWhether it's the rent study or others who have said look every health care system is expensive but you may actually spend less or you may have a more efficient system under a single payer you it doesn't seem like you buy that\nOh I Do buy it but I don't think the ran study um I think had significant\nA warnings in there that people like to run over and say oh by the way for example uh the rent so he talked about\nThe fact that under Arista which is a federal law that says you can't have states cannot do anything that impacts people's privately held healthcare that's a serious legal issue that the rent said he said hey everybody better pay attention to this nobody seems to want to talk about that\nAre so if your governor though it sounds it sounds like what you think is the best system as a national single payer assist absolutely can't go state by state assuming that nationally at least right now there's not going to be the appetite for a while if you were governor for four or eight years if we didn't see a national appetite does that mean the status quo would rule you\nKnow I think with what you have to do is drive more efficiencies be more effective about it and understand that health care is an issue that is an obstacle for our economy for employment and for people's day to day lives\nAnd I also want to ask you about something that I I read and I read from a source that's never on which is Twitter um but but I think this was probably pretty accurate because last night there was a a forum for candidates for state Senate and you had two incumbents and two challengers one of the incumbent state senator Joe robot could we hope to have in this program before the election\nWas quoted before the end of that forum last night as saying that he doesn't he thinks health care in the states pretty good to begin with that there's a lot of people who don't understand just how good we have it\nUm and again senator Rebecca from putting words in your mouth I'm I'm happy to correct the record but his point is why undergo a big onerous either change or expensive new system when it's pretty good I'm I'm not sure he thinks it's perfect but is it better than people give credit for or do you think he and other Republicans would made similar arguments are missing something there\nAnd they are missing something for working class people or a for people who are I'm struggling the healthcare doesn't work because they're paying so much\nThey're not getting any pay raises they're paying more for health care it's more and more expensive the benefits are less and less if you are truly poor or then you're getting you had the ability to get good benefits and very rich benefits\nThe issue of that is the mayor of Syracuse one of the poorest cities in in the country\nPeople who are truly poor don't know how to access all of these benefits in systems and then we have county governments who have this disincentive to keep people off of the rules to take advantage of these programs but you know the\nStephanie minor the candidate running for governor it's minor for N. Y. dot com is the website if you want to learn more let's get our only break in the hour and when we come back\nWe'll take more your emails and if you want to call the program aid for four to nine five talk it's toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five to six three W exercise here in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for we're going to talk about specific ideas regarding corruption which is a big part of the campaign\nFor Seventy minor what she would change at the state level also talk more about economic development she talked about people leaving the state specifically as governor what is she going to do to try to stop that we'll talk about that as well coming up [noise]\nI met enough in one then the next connections we hear from the candidates for state Supreme Court\nFor judges vying for to see we get to know the candidates and their priorities and you're all the chance to ask them questions than our second hour of the children in foster care system different institutions find forever and we hear from adoptive parents who share their stories\nAnd we'll talk to experts about how to help to navigate the emotional impact the foster care enough [noise]\n\nVoting rights advocates warn states are using new tactics to keep minorities from voting at the polls\nIt is almost a steady weight to the antiquated laws that discriminated against racial minorities and require them to pay to be able to I'm Audie Cornish\nConcerns over voter suppression in the mid term this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\nThis afternoon at for walking back to connections I'm having dogs and a lot of emails coming in we'll get to a couple of your phone calls in just a second Bennett says under the headline you go girl she says I'm so glad\nStephanie has joined the race for governor of New York state I've been uncomfortable with voting for Cuomo due to the corruption it's all about money after all she has earned him my vote\nThat's from done it then it thank you very much remember it's ... you got to go all the way down the ballot to find minor volt they next to this Sam line\nNext to the to the semi by the way you want to tell people what Sam ...\nSam stands for the serve America moving to a group of people got together and said we're not solving problems as Americans anymore and we need to do that and do it with civil dialogue fact based public policy a and a respectful a discussion\nVery well then maybe you can answer a listener named Dan's question\nHe's got some skepticism about Sam he says\nAmericans are growing increasingly disillusioned with politics and politicians the two parties status quo shakes out so unfavorably for so many of us in so many different ways to get one party appears to only want to make it worse while their counterparts drive to uphold it by all means necessary\nSam which is prominently featured on Stephanie's website is they bizarrely over to ... the Democratic and Republican parties\nSam was founded just last year by a top Morgan Stanley lawyer and George W. Bush administration staffer\nAnd there were competing paid states or ideology as big tent comprised of neo conservatism liberal conservatism social liberalism which sounds like the ideology of today's Neal liberal\nDemocrats from them so damned listen thank you for doing research on it that the party was founded short or it's not a party this is a movement a group of people\nThere are Democrats who worked for ... Obama and there are Republicans who worked for George Bush both to become disenchanted with this type of person environment I Would respectfully suggest that you go to the serve America movement party a website itself not with competing\nAnd you will see that as a group of people who have set up guard rails and said look we need to remember that as Americans\nThe way that we have always historically solve problems or work through problems is by doing it together and convening people together and that this hyper partisanship which in your comment and early on reference\nThis hyper partisanship is not allowing people to do that anymore in his discouraging it and then the serve America movement there are certain guard rails fiscal responsibility civil dialogue solving problems with facts and science um and understanding that people have the freedom to love\nFreedom to live with who they want to live with 'em and that we should guarantee ... people have good health care and mass incarceration and do it in a fiscally responsible way so again I Would say go to the serve America movement website there's lots of information on there and if you truly believe that both parties need a jolt\nThen you should vote on real life for minor vote they\nCarry in Victor on the phone first up go ahead Gary\nHi I just wanted to stay pretty recession or the or in a\nDifferent thing different taste I\nSay I want to go forward and the whole idea of working with others interested in finding\nSolutions are political parties looking just ideologically at all you know they just need to\nBut he ... which which is the whole thing that's happening it's not working I think I'm going to vote for her [noise]\nOkay Carrie thank you for the phone call drew Carey thank you very much and look the reality is this really comes directly from my experience as being a two term Aaron Syracuse I never\nAsked somebody when they came up to me are you a Democrat or Republican are you an independent and you know how we Hawkins who's the Green Party member lives in the city of Syracuse who was a constituent of mine and said okay I'm not going to solve your problem\nAnd in fact many times I called people and asked all sorts of different people to convene them around a table and said are we interested in improving graduation rates and getting better scores for the students that are public schools can you help us do that\nAnd nobody ever said no because again you know people come to party party registration for all sorts of different reasons and it should not be the end all be all about how you make decisions\nGary thanks for the phone call John in Henrietta next on the phone go ahead John\n[noise] my concern is ... what's what's it called rank order voting choice voting yeah but you because I turned Seventy this year in almost every election cycle I'm voting lesser of two evils because\nAfraid to five votes third party or independent I'm going to enable the [noise] the one I don't want them through it and that's like an ...\nYeah it's the it's the whole argument about don't uh don't enable a spoiler but I have to tell you I think the entire system is pretty spoiled and it's time to start sending messages that saying we're not going to accept a status quo that is a corrupt just because the while one leader happens to be a Democrat\nAgain I think public policy is about people and it's about solving problems and that doesn't mean that it's just about keeping entrenched Democrats in office or Republicans in office and I think that this year in this race is a perfect time to say that I Will tell you that I also think\nWhen we celebrate the Democratic turnout I think it was like twenty three percent and people were saying oh my God it was such a great turnout think about that\nWe celebrate that fact we we have\nA ... whatever Seventy two percent of registered voters have said no we don't like these choices we need to make it easier to vote and we need to him and make our democracy healthier\nI Know of a friend of mine who is a elected marrying a big city in California had a form of instant runoff and she was everybody's second choice and what she coming from New York this baffled me like oh my God how does that system work I Can't even understand it my head kind of exploded when she talked me about this\nWhen she said though was it was a great system because you know what it made everyone be civil to each other because you always thought ... am I going to be somebody second choice and maybe I Want to be and that way there was a lot less rank or a lot more talking about ideas and a lot more building community so I so when you're in terms of rank choice voting\n... this is a long way of saying I'm In favor of looking at all sorts of different ways that we can make voting easier and get more people engaged and whether you know that's early voting vote by mail no excuse we have to have nonpartisan redistricting\nOur democracy is sick and New York and we need to change the system to make it healthier and we'll have better public policy when we have more people voting and we'll be able to hold elected officials accountable for really solving problems for all New Yorkers notches campaign contributors\nBefore I get back to the phone those are some ... specific ideas that once again I Want to kind of hold you to it if you're governor early voting yes yes you're gonna you're gonna ... wrote a nonpartisan redistricting in this state absolutely\nAnd that's not going to your mind not going to change when you're in the levers of power no nope not at all a vote by mail yes yes ah remove restrictions on absentee ballots yes okay um and election day same day registration yes\nOkay and this is something I have to tell you this is\nRelatively speaking um us after the primary election in two thousand sixteen when I saw all of these are young voters in particular but all these voters who are engaged by Bernie Sanders and getting into the process and we're all disenfranchised because they couldn't vote in the primary cause they had not been registered Eighteen months before\nI saw in stark relief\nThat this was a system that was designed to not encourage people to participate and that we had taken all of these young people who we desperately needed to infuse our democracy and we're hoping ideas and turn them away and said we're not interested", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "city": "Rochester", "day": "23"}
