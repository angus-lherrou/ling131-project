secretary Wilbur Ross who approved adding that question to the ... census and John Gore you acting director of the Justice Department division that the administration says needs the question to better enforce their voting rights act\nIn revenues um and and this just you know keeps growing a it's a league that shares a in in its revenues are which is part of the big issue here why the NFL Owners have pressured the goal is from day one like hey you need a new stadium because we need to get more money out of you\nEven though you're the second smallest market in the NFL I mean that's the crux of this whole thing\nOr the NFL is pressuring the goal is right now so I'm\nI again I just [noise] where do we stop I mean it's not like we have this uh you know this blank check or that you know anytime we want something we can just add to it I I you know I just I at some point here this has to stop\nIt in a moment I'm gonna come back to the point that's got to make it because I think it's worth exploring a little bit more depth where the pressure's actually coming from Dennis what do you think on this\nWell I think I Would actually expand on that because\nIt is a lot of the ownership that makes these demands the other teams are saying things like you need to update your state I mean you need to do this needs to do that\nWell instead of going to taxpayers why not have the owners who are getting a billion dollars revenue a year each team gets about two hundred and fifty million and shared revenue why not create a capital fund that they can draw from if this is an economic tool for the league to expand\nWhy go to taxpayers in Green Bay did it the smaller market\nYou know they've got about three hundred thousand people in their metro area or they did a half percent sales tax increase for the county that lasted Fifteen Years is that something Erie County is willing to do is that something metro\nBuffalo is willing to do all of western New York to chip in for something like that I don't know that it's economically viable for western New York to do such a thing or if we have the stomach to do it given our own economic realities\nYeah and what Dennis brings up is one of many different mechanisms because sometimes we use the term taxpayer funding as if it's one sort of blanket thing there's different ways to do it we'll get back to there and just a second because um I I think the Green Bay example is a good one sales tax raise that Fifteen Years is that right\nNow as a Fifteen year when they did there I think it was the one I think they release that Ninety nine there are a big renovation the whole plan I think ah in those days I think it was two hundred Ninety five million\nAnd it was meant to modernize the stadium make it more of a revenue generator and they had a referendum and went through the state legislature they propose a county referendum and they agreed to do it but as a Fifteen year sales tax increase\nI I think one of the interesting points there and I can chime in on this because I'm a part owner of the Green Bay Packers [laughter] um is that there are community own team and one of the things that they did do 'em to raise a lot of money was if they offered shares I Believe there were two hundred and fifty dollars a share non voting share\nUm I can vote for the board of directors but I Can't tell you who should be playing quarterback or who should coach the team or whatever I don't have that kind of power\nBut they raised um they raised an awful awful lot of money or which was\nSent me a million ... how much was sixty four million for a million yeah and and so I contributed to that as as did many others in buying shares of Green Bay Packers stock and I'm a and so that money was used now and again it's a different model\nI've always liked this model in Green Bay of community ownership and I believe the largest shareholders like an American legion post on the outskirts of town like I went there and did a story on this whole thing but that you know there there are the outlier they're not going to happen to you know it's not going to happen we had looked into this before\nThe NFL will never ever allow that to happen again they weren't really really\nRich ultra rich owners that's what they want\nAnd so a couple of things he let me read from the Buffalo News editorial\n'em to flush this out a little bit more when when Dennis and Scott talk about the pressure coming from the NFL to make the bills even more profitable I think it's fair to say that of American professional sports the NFL's most the gala Terry and in terms of opportunity and revenue sharing to win I mean baseball\nYou've got the bullies on the block the New York Yankees and the players said violence for the Yankees and everybody a but it's a very different model than it is in the NFL which shares a lot of the revenue and so let me go to read from what the Buffalo News wrote about this\nQuote in March twenty sixteen New York giants owner John Mara told the news is Victor Ritchie the bills could be at a competitive disadvantage if they not did they did not erect new playing facility it gets tougher and tougher to compete when all these new stadiums are going up\nAnd the bills are in their original building more said and some NFL observers seeing only self interest in ... words each of the NFL's thirty two teams received an equal share of the league's national revenue each year the majority of the money which last year topped eight billion dollars per team\nIs from TV deals but there is revenue from other sources such as licensing and merchandise sales and that means when the bills who play in the NFL seconds most market make more money a share of the increase a increase in reach enrich a big market franchises like the giants and the Dallas Cowboys and the New England patriots\nAnd quote so Scott do you agree with the news that you know that the John Mars of the world are driving this maybe even more than ... and is there something venal about\nThat yeah I I definitely think that the pressure you know again this was like shortly after they became members of this fraternity the goal is I'm a ... this fraternity known as the national football league\nThey were being pressured and and it started with ... ... the commissioner Roger Goodell the commissioner of the NFL\nHe it you know his bosses are the owners to thirty two owners and you know they put it out there like hey you know everything's nice and well welcome the fraternity and so forth but ah by the way you better get a new stadium or you can't compete and I I think that the thinking here is that\nYou know you build like a downtown stadium that's smaller ... you know maybe you reduce it to you know fifty five thousand or whatever so you can control the ticket prices even more\nYou will have more luxury sweets although I Wonder about our western New York economy you know the days of Eastman Kodak and Bosch and long and Xerox being fortune\nSupport

how they feel washing the ravens celebrate ... we we enjoyed beating the robots last week the fandom I think it needs to stay geographic here um so when it comes to ways and mechanisms for for taxpayers to get involved here let's say that's going to happen and again if you're just joining us part of the reason we're having this conversation now is\nYes it is five years from now for the bills to have this lease and with new era field but nobody's going to wake up in four years and go well you got a year left what do we do here I mean there's pressure now there's pressure from the league to pressure from the other owners\nAnd the Buffalo News editorial came out this past weekend saying look it's going to happen it has to happen and it's probably going to include some form of taxpayer support so there's different mechanisms and the most commonly I guess the sales tax you think of me having worked in government yourself I don't know how you think politicians view this ... what do you think they're calculus is going to be for something like\nThis well I think it can be a difficult one for public leaders because there will be an outcry no one would want to be say a pond cars the county executive of Erie County and having to run for reelection and be labeled the guy who lost the bills right that's a\nSomething Scott the Tony ... who is a longtime Rochester sports columnist and author has his own pace in the Rochester Business Journal bill stadium debate could heat up in the not so distant future and he makes the case that\nThese guys get enough money and maybe call their bluff will see Dennis O'Brien is a long time Buffalo Bills fan with experience in government as well let's get that only break in the hour right here on connections\n[noise]\nComing up in

the editor in chief of buffalo rumblings which is the SPN ... sports blog nation site for the Buffalo Bills Matt thanks for joining us how are you\nI'm good how are you very good to join this conversation because I think um you know this is something that just about everybody has a viewpoint on here in western New York the so far I'm not seeing a lot of love for yes funded the stadium with my tax dollars maybe that's out there\nUm and and I want to start with just your general take on whether you number one do you agree with the the Buffalo News that there will have to be a stadium that that's going to be part of the deal if you want to keep this franchise and if that's true assuming it'll be about around a billion dollars or you supportive of using some taxpayer money for them\nWell I think that that is\nIt's true with the pressure from the NFL um\nWell the NFL Owners including giants on John ... said this I think it was last year or something if the NFL Owners meetings that\nYou know ... teams need newer stadiums to keep up with revenue streams and ... and so they're either going to have to renovate ruffle some stadium pretty extensively um and ... or build a brand new stadium now I only picked up the last ... tail of the conversation you guys had\nFor the last half hour um but like is that the guy that called the inner wrote in from Chicago where they destroyed a soldier field but that's exactly what they did that that they completely renovated it like I mean hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars not quite one billion I don't think but\nYou know just a complete facelift of the of the stadium that at the same thing in Kansas City arrowhead where they did it looks like I mean like a hundred million dollar renovation as opposed to just buying and building a new site and that's kind of what they're going for it\nYou know being able to generate new revenue inside the stadium whether it's you know craft beer garden Tiller they knew what the patriots have done over ... stadium where they're building this whole kind of village around the city on the\nEconomic and business and residential areas and things like that I just think that that's where\nAn F. O. teams are going to generate more revenue for themselves on as far as using years the taxpayer money or whether Erie County or whatever I mean that's just the way that things have been going\nOn I Can't remember the last privately funded NFL stadium I mean the one the only one I could think of off the top of my head is the patriots won Bob Kraft bought the team um\nBut that was a long time ago and the school is just spent whether that was one point four billion dollars to buy the bills and you can plug Lewis said this\nEarlier this year that you know he just spent ... billion dollars I don't know if we've got another billion just laying around for us to to privately funded a brand new stadium so I think that's the direction the NFL watch typical or to take\nUm I think it was our very has tend to do it because\nOf the economic conditions and allow their stuff that would kind of go into a moving into a new stadium\nAll right so given all of those factors I think everybody agrees at least on the landscape then do you want to see it happen and are you okay if if they go to taxpayers and say we need you\nPersonally I Am because I use their product a lot a lot I'm watching a lot of those games I'm Talking about some of the time that kind of civic identity and all this other stuff that is the the ... the end\nOf the last half hour like if if you're going to do it you know you weren't going to get that money back and\nI mean there's there's certain things that the government does funds that they can see all the money that they put into it but it's hard to sift through the whatever it is I it just has to be okay with that if you want to keep those in Buffalo which I think even people that don't watch football necessarily want to keep\nThose in Buffalo maybe not everybody but a lot of people\nYeah and and here's an email from another listener name Steve who writes Evan I cannot imagine Sundays in the fall without the bills but I won't pretend that shelling out a billion dollars or whatever or even two hundred and fifty million dollars is going to bring a perfect return on our investment I think it's a losing bet but it's a ... I still think we should make\nBecause it's about quality of life it's about regional identity and how do we put a price tag on that that's where you are Matt\nYeah only after study has proved him but it does not for two investment to\nTo ... you know what are the ... minutes power the it is and even if you're taking those kinds of things like the income tax and tourism dollars and all this other stuff even if you count like them showing dire gr falls on CBS across the country or you know Sunday in London on the primetime games things like that\nEven if you count that as a Latina tourism dollars\nIt just isn't going to provide the return on investment to to pay for it so I'm not saying it's a bad investment no food but it's just never going to stop you know whether the number it's only five hundred million dollars it's probably not going to go out to that number [noise]\nAll right so then the question becomes an alternative to met warns on the line with us got the Tony act Dennis O'Brien studio and Scott and Dennis ... we briefly brought this up let's let's talk for a moment about what it would mean not just to build a stadium but to connect it to something like a convention center does that make more sense to\nYou Scott I think so um I you know I look at like Indianapolis a Lucas soil stadium in in Indianapolis built a new convention center to kind of tight and look at nobody wants to be just for the bills and eight games a year or tan or if you're gonna throw in playoffs or whatever ... excuse me home playoff watched\nYes I I remember last I'm old enough and experience that's out of whole play ... games um\nBut you know to to be able to use this um you know for for many other events year round and I had posited in my column like even you could maybe even I Know this may sound strange to some people but you can maybe even hosts like a final forty and say basketball tournament or\nYou know a Super Bowl even um you know thinking really really big but nonetheless like you want to get a maximum use out of this building um and and the bills would retain their campus so to speak back at a\nAn orchard park I still don't know what you would do with the stadium that's going to be a big white elephant drag on you and stuff but um you know I I think uh I think this might be a ...\nBut more palatable to taxpayers if you had if you kind of twin these projects in Poland cars is just come out and said he you know are you know are we going to be in the convention business he wants a new convention center in downtown buffalo so maybe at some point now I'm driving the price tag way up and you're going to see like\nA has ownership metal man you know how one point five billion by ... you know the eventual random because everything comes in under budget just so you know when it happens I Know that it comes to government ... Dennis how do you view the marriage of a possible convention center in Buffalo and the bill stadium and does that make it any more palatable\nTo you yes it does because one of the problems with using tax dollars for something like an NFL team is that you know ten games or mentioned maybe eleven games\nHas a limited use of a facility that is that large right and a lot of people don't get to use it you know talking about Seventy something thousand people per week a lot of those a repeat customers\nIf not a very community wide thing so if you pair up with something that would get more usage that would be a more widespread community asset that would be great it'd be an efficiency of scale uh you're already building stuff you know if you already have other things that you want to uh make it into a you know I've\nBeen in different stadiums where they do have those types of spaces and you can go into them year round and you know that's something that could be you know even a convention and say oh hey\nBy the way while you're on break at the convention you wanna go kick some feel goes on an NFL stadium [laughter]\nYeah I mean who knows right\nBut it's something that at least the government can say\nWe're going to build this any way they need to build this thing you know if we kind of merge together we can get some mutual benefit off of it and make it a better facility both for the users and a better deal for the community do you think that's what's going to happen here\nAh honestly I don't know uh you know I think traditionally it seems as though in western New York we tend to cheap out on things and we in this case I think that would I'd hate to say cheap out when you spend a half ... half a billion dollars to renovate\nVersus you know one point to one point five billion to build new but you think of things like uh the blue cross arena when it was a war memorial that we were discussing is a fair but I remember like they didn't want to raise the ... I was too expensive so you have\nAh and I've had some of my best sports journalism moments covering this team but I Do think there is at some point here\nYou know again when is enough enough um you know\nSo Dennis can you equip them or I could easily equip them um but I think that's more related to\nThe concussion issue I Wonder if the long term viability of the sport itself\nI'm I'm with you on that as a fan that that is challenged me the most\nBecause I I feel that\nA damn mentioned that the the league is indifferent to say buffalo and by sanctioning individual teams\nAnd I would agree I think they're even more indifferent to the fact that they're willing to give their own employees brain damage ... and you see X. NFL players who've\nBeen lucky enough to play the game and make a lot of money doing it saying things like they wouldn't let their kids play football yeah you know things like that also you know call into question what the league is about its priorities are and how the sport will evolve\nOr will evolve yeah I I that's really hard for me and uh I I Wonder Matt warring as a fan and as a writer if the concussion issue as moved you at all\nWell yeah and it certainly has been hearing the stories whether it's the Darryl ... story that I'm ... that the Buffalo News is the last year the year before you know hearing these stories of of former players and the the kind of the trials and things have gone through was just it really does resume and\nI mean they're changing the rules that neither going more and more away from some of those big hits but even last week or ... killing Benjamin took a huge shots the head that wasn't even\nFlags and there's there are all these every single week and you can just go down the list and it it it can be very troubling\nAh one thing I just don't understand is this argument that we got to retrain these guys they don't know how they can give me a break you give me a break yeah\nI I think you know I don't I don't think there's a solution you know you know talked about like safer helmets and rules changes and this and that it's a violent collision sport and at what point I mean you're moving you move it move it where it's no longer you've taken the core away from it and I hate you know it is the hitting is the appeal\nTo a lot of people I mean that warrior mentality that gladiator mentality\nWell I mean sometimes we have to get to grow up a little at some point we read a few more emails for re lose the hour John ... protest I and many other taxpayers are not interested in football and don't watch or ten bills games I think the taxpayer share of the billion dollars should instead be used Tour de sorely needed high speed rail service connecting buffalo Rochester Syracuse\nNew York city Scott says how do you put a price tag on quality of life easy all these things literally come with a price tag\nMore importantly how do you measure the outcome the taxpayer dollars spent on building a stadium won't include clearing the sidewalks so that people in wheelchairs can actually get there well the NFL help out with that\nTim in Pittsburgh says I'm a big bills fan and I don't want so much money at all spent on a new stadium I'm sick of being held hostage by team ownership listening them complain is freaking criminal on their part I don't feel sorry for them at all Rochester and buffalo or two of the poorest cities in the country and this is what we're going to raise taxes for\n... there's a lot of that there's a there's a lot of appropriate I'm kind of springing force here\nAnd so I just want to thank our guests are kind of at least laying out the landscape because you know ... I appreciate we're going to be reading your stuff on buffalo rumblings you're gonna have a lot to say I'm sure the next five years but my guess is this will get settled in the next three I don't think you're going to get anywhere close to that five year deadline to you\nKnow I think it's going to get settled before that I mean the the the bills just hired one of the former New York state economic advisors I don't remember his title sorry but they're just hired one of those guys and it wasn't like because they just wanted them to the building there they're putting together actually steps to to get the stadium done\nOne of the other yeah ah and then if you could quit the bills Scott what do you want fans to thirty seconds to finish what do you what do you want fence to do about this\nI I'm I again I just think there's a price there's a there's a certain limit how far can you go um I don't want to see them leave I think they have been great for the quality of life in our region and have been a very big positive part of it but\nAgain we're going to have to determine what prices too much I don't think they're leaving I mean they're they're they're going to be staying put here\nOkay that's when you think they're you're staying put Dennis I agree Denis says they're staying Matt stain or live in this day and I can\n[laughter] like okay I'm I'm not going to be cynical wanted to say they're leaving by the money is really what drives the league met Warren thanks for the time we appreciate you want from buffalo rumblings and thanks for joining the program today [noise]\nAnd our thanks to Scott Tony I read his stuff in our BJ the Rochester Business Journal always good Scott thank you so much thanks for having and Dennis O'Brien go back to work man next we'll do [laughter]\nI enjoy your vacation or you pick the best October day ever for a vacation to talk my gosh [laughter] more connections is coming up next [noise]\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views express do not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent of WXXI X Y you strictly prohibited connections with Evan Dawson is available as a podcast just click on the connections link a double helix news\nDot org this was WXXI in Rochester nobody ...

Anthony bridge that we have this is sort of in the background of that when you look at the classic Rochester downtown skyline so it's really an iconic\nResource that the community as a whole you know owns\nUm and so I think the worst possible outcome would be\nSomething going through that you know only a select group of people has approved and vetted you know it can be the best design in the world but if the community hasn't been engaged in the process and hasn't had a chance to\nHave their voice heard and if all sides haven't than consider all possible impacts haven't been considered I think that you know people won't be invested in the change\nAnd you know whatever goes there may not be something that if the community not invested in it then it's not that many communities going to use\nAnd how do you view this debate the communities having their when [noise]\nUh you know I agree with what Caitlin or just mentioned I I think that it's interesting it's interesting question what's the worst worst case scenario I guess it would depend on what the community\nEstablishes as programmatic goals so one of programmatic goal would be to um increase but has three and traffic by connecting those two parts of the city\nThat I think a design needs to reflect um those goals too often I think in in our cities and not just Rochester but in our cities all across the country I think we'd go into these projects quickly especially if there's funding involved\nThere's a public outcry to make sure that ah revitalization occurs quickly and a consistently and in this particular case that resources so complicated um for those that may not be aware so it's like a ... you know it's it's the original aqueduct\nAnd then there's the Nineteen twenty two deck a that was put on top of of the aqueduct which is ... is the roadway\nWhen that was added it really did create a problem for the surrounding buildings because now the surrounding buildings um our Jeannie station six comes to mind it's no longer at grade there is an appearance at the urging the station is actually below grade when in fact it's it's it's not\nSo there's some great challenges that the city really has to wrestle with and those are legitimate\nAnd I think that our concern is with the process we want to make sure that\nIf we have programmatic goals as a as a city and as a community\nThe design needs to reflect that because we get one shot and we see all over the country ... urban renewal projects in urban revitalization projects that are well intentioned and uh once they're designed a constructed we don't see any human beings using them\nAnd it becomes a waste of money and in some senses it really sets back to revitalization efforts why ... why does why do we have well designed projects that end up with very few people using them\nWell I think it goes back or probably from urban renewal days in the sixties you know Jane Jacobs in New York City used to say that we're building ... that have no ... and it there there's a lot of factors that go into that um there's a lot of\nDepending on location and and how how you design a space that really speaks to our human interaction so I mean spaces can be cold and and and and just inviting and they can also be warm and inviting so [noise] um this project\nIs just starting I'm there hasn't really been designed discussions and that's why we felt like it was timely to include this resource on this list not to try and and point the finger at at the city or anyone else we we don't feel like that the resources endangered\nBut there's a there's a lot of graffiti art that's also located uh in in in the original portion of the aqueduct\nThose voices really need to be heard um so it's a complicated discussion there's going to undoubtedly a need to be compromise and we call for that compromise but we're looking forward I think to representing the you know the preservation voice I'm In in that design discussion\nUnder ... can I ask 'em you know can't live do you view\nA debate like this is inevitably going to have winners and losers I only ask that because I'm thinking of what Wayne just raised the question what the art there is a really remarkably good art\nThat has been created there and it's sort of considered public space for for artist to to do that and and then there's there's some pretty heated emotional debate about um whether that it's time to move on from that or whether you can preserve that in some way other inevitably going to be winners and losers\n[noise]\nWell yeah I mean I guess the sort of the cliche is\nThat you know you can't make everyone happy and maybe the best compromises where everyone's a little bit unhappy [noise] um but you know to your point there that the the space that's kind of grown up organically and the aqueduct\nYeah there was a world renowned artists that you know have done work down there and it's a major attraction for people I mean I'm Amazed when I meet other nerdy preservation is um that are my age from other cities the\nThing they said to me was oh Rochester that's we have the aqueduct with all the street are and like I Want to come and see that and I was like how do you even know about known and apparently so ... yeah I mean maybe there is ... ... yeah I don't think it's\nPossible to make everyone happy but I think as long as there's a\nChance for everyone to share their vision and their perspective you know if people can feel hurt and part of the process you\nKnow maybe we can get to some\nAcceptable resolution okay fair enough and and do you think at least ... rock the river way has put this right in its sights as they start to move forward with plans\nBe pretty happy that at the very least the decision makers are keeping in mind devalue preservation that that there is a thought that the design should be thoughtful that we should be incorporating different voices yeah absolutely I you\nKnow I also think that rock the river way uh I think for for many years some folks in the community maybe rightly so have been critical\nIn a calling attention to the need to connect our resources particularly downtown so this was a a an aggressive approach\nAnd a rock the river weighs sixty that connect all of these interesting resources so yeah we we support the the the project in its entirety is just a as one of the devil's in the details and we wanted to get this on the list to make sure that we called out to everyone's attention\nFor the last five years the landmark society has released their annual five to revive list in the fall and so this is your six with them doing that\nYou can check out past lists and the current on their website landmarks society dot org\nI almost said come lend more excited dot org I've no idea what the dot com would take you to but landmark society that or if you want to see the list so there's one Rochester's aqueduct re imagined\nSecond one I Want to talk about his Colgate Rochester ... divinity school campus now um it's the whole campus campus correct I don't I don't know how big of a campus we're talking about but tell me why it landed on the list and then I Know Monica is a lot to say about that particular [laughter]\nYeah so it's a really important point that it's the whole campus because\nThe the campus as a whole is the historic resource so it's not just the historic buildings but the historic designed landscape is an integral part of that property\nI'm In a part of his historic significance so we worked with neighbors like Monica um last year to to help get the campus designated and officials city Rochester landmark\nSo that any major changes to the property you know the the the property the buildings are protected from demolition and any major changes whether it's new construction or changes in the landscape have to go before the city Rochester's preservation board\nUm so the the landscape is really it's really easy to look at those fancy architect design buildings and say oh yeah those are important cool historic buildings but with a little bit less I'm a parent an obvious is that that landscape is also a does an important designed resource so it's not like\nIt's just a hill with some trees on it was designed by a very prominent landscape architect from Rochester ... for us he also designed the gardens at George Eastman house um and as the sunken garden behind um Warner castle and highland park\nSo that resource even though it looks like it's just a natural bucolic setting that's just as important as the building so we're looking at it as a whole the buildings in the landscape together as one piece\nOr if there was a theme than what's the worst case scenario for what happened to the campus like that [laughter]\nThey sell it it's built that I built over in Iraq yeah yeah I think in the same way that the worst case scenario for a historic building is that it's removed to the mall the worst case scenario for historical landscape is that it's a removed or what the ... buildings\nOkay and so Monica why don't you take me through as a neighbor of that how you view that particular piece of property and while you view it in such important terms when it comes to preservation\nHistoric relics from from a bygone era when it comes to the stadiums\nYeah I don't know what's gonna happen to the new or a few of buffalo build a new stadium downtown what happens there I'm In a closed loop on that because enough about the bills but I Do want to ask you a ... working preservation knowing how difficult it is sometimes deliberate support for\nUm do you view that as a separate conversation or you mildly appalled by these kinds of conversations about taxpayer support for brand new stadiums for billionaire owners\nCaitlin [laughter]\nYou're thrilled to be asked that question yeah I you know I I think a ... ... there's there's lots of other projects that could potentially you know really benefit and have what we talked about catalytic impact um in communities and real need\nOkay when you know\nI guess my my knee jerk would be to agree with Caitlin statement I haven't really given it much much thought I have I have absolutely no idea how much\nHow much revenue was from New York derives from from it so I I Know I'm really not educated even make a statement on it um well I'm Sorry that that is such a such a polite dodge from you I'm going to get a phone call on this is Bonnie in Rochester on line what go ahead money [noise]\nYeah uh it's not a two part question that comment ... didn't know you do that with a dinosaur barbecue places uh yeah ... what the origins are at the history of that building because\nI Know it was it you know one point wasn't use very much and and so it has some kind of history and the other thing I really want to\nAsk that question but the other thing about this is um what do you say about this monster that monstrosity that they'd built next to the dinosaur it takes up\nFor court down to south most ugly building I've ever seen in my life cuts off one of the best use of where that same area where it can look at the bridge and night and stuff\nI don't know who except that somebody maybe get somebody some money or something because it now it has pushed that dinosaur to it till it looks like it doesn't have the same feel to it\nBut first question what what's the history and second of all please tell me I'd rather hear nobody had any input that knows what they're doing so I can understand that there is to pay that debt that feeling they have there now that expensive I this is a deplorable\n... bunny just before you go here I I I think what you're describing is the new housing development that is under Bob Morgan's umbrella is that correct yeah OK FBI guy ... okay [laughter]\nAnd the FBI or Alex ... who is chief of staff for the city of Rochester and mare Warren did say on this program he he disagrees with to take that it is disrupting the aesthetics and that he thinks it's going to fit in pretty well\nDoes he have I I I appreciate the phone call bunny thank you I'm Caitlin Wayne um for on the history of dinosaurs the building I don't know\nYeah so that a few years ago maybe five or six years ago now we did a little series um called from ice or an opportunity on our website so if you go to our website and search ice or you can find the story\nOf the dinosaur barbecue building it was a railroad\nStation um depot that was vacant for quite a while and I believe it was a developer bend can dig who actually acquired it and yeah it was it was a wreck and he he was one of the first developers in Rochester if not the first to really have vision\nFor these um dilapidated vacant especially industrial structures to rehab them and put them to productive economic you so that's a really good early example of adaptive use\nI'm here in the city and you know as far as the construction next door you know new new and sell is an important part of regenerating our city and you're always going to have people\nThat no one's going to be ... that people there's it as a matter of you know personal opinion when it comes to the design of buildings\nOkay what well and I\nI don't believe that the buildings the pure design of the building I don't believe was really something that's regulated so uh\nIt's a developer right privately funded um I Would say that it's it's oftentimes a balancing act that the landmark society a walks through so to speak I think that\nWe want new development and new development brings more people and the more people we have than the more viable or historic resources are the best way to preserve a historic building is to make sure that it's used in his loved and it's taking care of and\nSometimes you need new development to actually create the vibe and the buzz in order to preserve the old and so it's a delicate mixture so\nI I've heard people comment that they they they love that building and I've heard a just like Bonnie people who who really really detest it so uh it's if there were not if we're not careful my phones are about to be filled up with people\nWho have opinions on that for the rest of the hour we'll just have maybe we'll talk about the summertime Monica your Rochester and have you seen it\nWell yeah yeah I mean I Would but from my perspective um it's kind of the flip side of some of that conversation we have an historic buildings which is you know just because they're beautiful doesn't mean you know they need to be saved or they should be saved in in the subjective opinion of a building whether it's a piece of history or a new piece of\nYour history is that the design is subject to sell 'em you know as\nA kind of device it as that may be on a new building it it kinda gets back to\nUm you know the deeper level is the significance of our historic assets which is beyond just what they look like because that is subject and it's it's a deeper meaning there um and the meaning of this building is still unknown we we won't know into into the future so that the judgment there to be reserved\nRight so I'm I'm way far only break Keith we'll take your phone call when we come back from our break a number going to go back down the list or we're working our way through the five to revive it's the landmark societies annual list they choose five sites buildings et cetera all across the region\nTrying to decide what are the sites that need emphasis whether it's trying to liberate some government support for preservation\nOr some community grassroots support that's always welcome there's some wonderful folks who are always involved with these efforts and you're meeting some of them this hour back you just heard Monica McCullough who's been so involved with what's been going out at the\nThe campus of Colgate divinity and the neighborhood they're and they're on the list this year Bob seem as a board member of the for friends of parrot hall what you're gonna hear about just a moment ... Goodman from the landmark society let's get that break in a ride back your connections\n\nI'm Evan Johnson Thursday and the next connections to two thousand Eighteen upstate Latino some it comes to Rochester\nIt's a one day event featuring influential Latino speakers from across the safe we'll preview then in our second hour taking a look at the wall photography place in protest movement or icy press has published who's streets our street and we'll discuss the power I kind of images hopefully there's [noise]\n[noise]\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from the high falls women's film festival working to change the landscape for women in film with features shorts workshops and talks with filmmakers at the little theater November first through the fifth\nPasses and tickets available at high false film festival dot com\nWelcome back to connections Dawson Keith in Farmington next go ahead Keith\nOr in your early and Greece will admired society she asked where I live now where I was wondering why markets like side it could cost\nLike to touch on is\nSome of the school renovation a basic they should have been demolished and so rather than they modeled much charged ... to rush upset and they just need daily against larger his goal then it would be changing market down and start all over again\nUm I ... I say our our war saving a fellow woman in that are much they love her high point there I Believe they have to consider that caught and just knock it down and rebuild [noise]\nCaitlin absolutely to answer the question how often do we consider cost every single second of every single day that is the number one thing that Wayne and I and our colleagues do um preservation is probably the most practical people you will meet we realized that\nBuildings cannot be saved just for the sake of saving buildings there has to be an economically viable use the numbers have to make sense and you have to have the money\nTo fix them up um most of the time\nI'm rehabbing and investing in an existing building an existing infrastructure is actually more um economically efficient than demolishing and building new\nAnd I I think we try to hesitate in in getting um a while I think that the uh the notion of if it costs more tear it down seems to be simple on the surface it's not that easy um what are you tearing down and what do you have after you tear down to rebuild so if we're going to demolish of building\nLet's say that has\nTrue brick wall slate roofs marble floors and we're going to knock that down and replace it with a building that has a Fifteen to twenty year lifespan that's not a good investment in the long term so you think we have to be careful about how we we place a value in what value means\nI Would just say [noise] my my guess is Caitlin a first year preservation of ... you know there was someone who's just kind of getting into it might have looked kind of stars in their eyes but like a fifth year or a tense here has no illusions that over what like as realistic", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "10"}
