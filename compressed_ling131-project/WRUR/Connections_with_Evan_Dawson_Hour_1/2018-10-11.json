Latino voters make up about twelve percent of the American electorate with more than twenty seven million eligible voters\nThose numbers will continue to grow in the coming years the question is whether Hispanic turnout will increase as well so far it doesn't look promising at a national level Hispanics have consistently registered lower turnout\nThan white black or Asian voters as a matter of fact more eligible Hispanic voters have decided to stay home rather than vote in every election since Nineteen Ninety six to make matters potentially worst more than forty percent\nOf potential Hispanic voters are millennials another dispirited demographic when it comes to voting and quote\n... are you more optimistic that things will start to change with participation among Hispanic Latino voters in this country\nWell I think um first of all here locally regionally where we've had the influx of folks from Puerto Rico I Do hope that we get a bump\nOf folks that have moved here and are ... are used to be politically engaged an active so I Do think I Am optimistic here in the region um the northeast where we see so many folks in in Florida where so many folks have come from Puerto Rico\nI think some communities in the United states feel disenfranchised so I've lived in lots of parts of the United states and I think if you take apart like my time in Miami where Hispanics are so political politically connected I\nThink they just three factors because I've had to speak on this a few times three factors that helped down there that we don't have in the rest of the United states won his success I mean nothing makes you want to come out and vote more than having seen results and sometimes I think our folks here have gotten behind candidates and not gotten the results that we hope then that's\nDiscouraging so Florida I mean it's you have tons of elected officials who exert power you see the results people get mortgage second thing is for a long time and with the Cuban community in the United in Florida you had that\nThat one issue that one rallying cry which was get Castro out they've got people out and\nI don't think we have that issue I Do think Trump for some folks has been an issue that has galvanized galvanizing so I think we will see a bump because of that you have that one rallying cry that gets people out to vote and then the third thing I think that you see down I'm In a place like Florida versus\nOur area is that\nUm you have a high concentration so in Rochester we think we have like a Latino neighborhoods which we do with our folks are really spread out all over the county whereas in Florida you have a place like Hialeah that's\nNinety eight percent are Hispanic you're going to get more of your going to have more success in the elections\nOkay well ... let me read also a little bit from\nLands peace and then an email I got from a listener named Maria this morning and then what we're going to do is we're going to lay out what's coming up in upstate Latino summit which is coming our way and just what six days is that right now the next is yes excellent next Monday so I'm so from from lands piece of land across his piece in slate\nUh he writes the following it would seem reasonable to assume that after three under it uninterrupted years of demonizing ostracized and persecuting the country's Hispanic immigrants\nTrump and his nativist enablers would have held to pay with Latinos at the ballot box come November and beyond trouble is they might not Hispanic voters have become a maddening puzzle for the Democratic party\nTwo thousand sixteen was supposed to be the year America's great demographics sleeping giant with finally awaken\nShaken out of its slumber by Trump's rhetoric some predicted the massive we have arrived moments that would include a surgeon voter registration and a dramatic increase\nIn turn out of the polls Latino wave and over optimistic colleague told me would come ashore and prove that Hispanic voters truly held the key to the White House but it has not happened yet\nUm let me go out and reach ... that's from his piece let me read this email I got from a listener to this morning who heard me talking to Beth Adam is at nine twenty about the show and she sent this email her name's Maria she says ... Puerto Rican mother and grandmother I'm also a conservative but I Am not a Republican\nI Know you're not talking about politics this hour but I just want to tell you that it's difficult to be I'm Sorry let me just make them reading remote can I just tell you that it's difficult to be a conservative woman\nWho is Puerto Rican my mother raised me to take care of myself not to rely on others or the government I Believe many people in the Hispanic community take that mindset we have to\nBut right now it's so hard hearing all the time that this president said this or that one day it's the Mexicans one day it's Puerto Rico we're listening but I think he doesn't care but I think the Democratic party takes us for granted too does anyone care about us does anyone care about my values my culture\nLastly I Believe in preserving our culture but learning to speak English also and respecting American traditions we can do both\nThank you for listening in the mail from a listener named Maria I'm ... I saw him out the word while Julio\nI think that's a a great summary of how a lot of Hispanics feel that um you we have where we would say a slap to the face I'm with something like the response to Hurricane Maria on the island\nAnd then there's many Latinos and feel that the Democratic party takes us for granted and um we do have a lot of traditional values that would make us more conservative and once again not to\nPaint with broad strokes sure as we are not monolithic but um you know I always think of Reagan's old quote from the eighties uh you know Hispanics are Republicans they just don't know it\nUm because we're supposedly have you know the strong I'm a conservative tendencies but we also are just I think looking for his back then and access to the American dream and\nThat's where I can sense her frustration I think she puts it together in a in a very succinct and powerful way in hell that I guess so if you look\nAt the politics here how many elected officials do we have\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comes from our members\nAnd from ... a small batch ... brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what the ... available to go on line at cat ... dot com\nThat have run and most of the time that I mean those are not always but some of those have been Hispanic and when I've been involved in those Hispanic um those campaigns for Hispanic American\nUm all the volunteers or Hispanic or we don't have that broad support from from the community I I don't like that that don't want to try to figure out why but that's what I've seen\nAll right and so the reason I read Marines email and when I got this morning I thought but this is really helps criticize at least in my mind when I look at the polling way I look at the numbers\nThe way that this community is not monolithic so we're going to try to talk about\nThe issues that will be prioritized at the summit next week\nWhy those issues rise to the fore while knowing that this is not a monolithic community and there'll be differences of opinion but listeners if you want to join the conversation I'm no matter your background but particularly if you're in\nA Latino and Hispanic community aid for four to nine five talk it's toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five or six three W ...\nIf you're in Rochester to six three nine nine nine four\nHilda Rosario Asher and who are signs or hear from the barrel American action league\nAnd they're here because next Wednesday as he upstate Latino summit and it's coming to Rochester um and it it moves around\nTypically it does seem a little more set down to uh we\n[laughter]\nAll right so um we've we've covered a good amount of ground in the voting side I Want to get her only break in the hour I'm gonna come back we're going to talk about the two thousand Eighteen upstate Latino summit which is coming to Rochester six days from now that's October seventeenth from idiom to four pm next week at the riverside convention center hosted by you Barrow\nAnd hear from your barrel Julio science and he'll do Rosario Asher or here we're going to talk about some of the other subjects that are going to be coming your way a different sections different workshops going on next week's we'll talk about those uh they're bringing in speakers from around the state so much more to discuss after our only break in the hour right here on connections\n\nComing up in our second hour the power of protest movements and photo journalism some remarkable and haunting images\nDuring social demonstrations in New York City\nThese images capture the pain and sometimes the progress in our country when it comes to race relations police brutality age we're activism and more you talk to a photo journalist behind the images that [noise]\nHurricane micro continues to wreak havoc through the Gulf Coast region the wind was so strong fisheries you here just about every ... cracking in breaking and handle Wayne just hitting up against the house if you could tell him with something major\nAnd I'll say change the latest on the historic deadly hurricane this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nThis afternoon at four\nWelcome back to connections I I Can't help but wonder if when he'll there was already lashar hears the coverage of hurricane Michael and they're dealing with the devastation down there in the Florida Panhandle is that hurricane now moves toward the Carolinas I'm sure you're always thinking of Puerto Rico and Maria\nI Do and I I I tell you every day I become more and more discouraged and more discouraged yes because when there is a hero Cain coming to a any state\nA semi and the government I really right there\nA while in place though he was talking to my sister in law on Saturday and she had been without electricity and waste salt water for three days so they are still having those issues there there was a thing I don't want to go back to here I came there yet but I have to tell you it's\nUh the other thing is that I was talking to my family and in a\n... they have millions off bottles of water that same I was paying a I'm has to be paid\nFor storage two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a month just someone is make being reach out of the suffering\nOf the people what the fate of ah when ... when I went to put on so many people needed water and there was no water bean store\n[noise] let me get a phone call before we continue on with what's coming up at the summit next week this is David in Rochester on line one go ahead David\nHello how are you a good really good show however I take a a issue um Dutch wore wonderful in bowling I'm an American\nI take issue with the concept in his own ... uh but you don't want to exercise your responsibility but ... it's just basically what I'm Talking about voting\nYou know you wonder right to hold that you don't want to respond stability that goes without the right to me yeah and and that's what the what we have today\nYou know a ... the less people to both the more uh ... homes or a can be manipulated all I'll take the answer and the whole month off line thank\nYou OK David thanks very much so I mean I I think held in Holyoke stayed pretty plainly that they disagree with the idea that there should be required voting um but I think that maybe there was a middle ground between requiring voting by law or or having some sort of penalty or fine for not voting\nAnd reframing the conversation at least by saying you have a responsibility to vote they you know no one's going to find you if you don't put there should be so ... and ... and maybe that's where we're David is Hilda\nAnd that and that is what I always preached to my community you know\nA ... we're not forcing you to vote but as a citizen and American city send it is your responsibility to vote because a lot is involved you know you are giving power\nTo go to a man that is going to these psi house seats are going to be for you\nSo you got to have that responsibility came to live\nAnd I think voter apathy is an issue across all ethnic communities all groups and all demographics in the United states well especially among younger folks but it is a huge problem and\nUm you know it's been a lot written about whether people just feel disenfranchised from the entire process and\nAt one thing I see a lot of millennials talking about is this idea of doesn't matter who you vote for you know as soon as we like we're not going to win no matter what and I think that's the bigger issue and I think you see that more in a community like the span of community but it's a problem across the board in the United states\nDavid thanks for the call I Would say a more harshly made ah if I'm remembering my Dutch correctly and call anytime I appreciate the phone call a gym in Rochester is up ... we we don't have oh I see okay so let's do this before we get back to some of your phone calls\nI'm let's keen on what else is coming our way with the upstate Latino some it because it is six days away you can still registered jump on embarrass website online to do that\nAnd there's a lot of different seminars and workshops et cetera so Julio what's ... what is sort of the mission overall here when you start offering these different sections you want people in the business community you want people in government and healthcare et cetera how do you put it together\nWe do have a statewide committee that puts feast together or the picks the topics and then work together to pull a diverse group of presenters so for those of you that are thinking of coming understand that this isn't just\nSome of the same people you've seen from Rochester where people from buffalo from Ithaca from Albany from uh Syracuse from all over coming I'm so you'll hear a diversity of opinions\nAnd then the ideas most of the most of the workshops our panel discussions and so that we do have that representation from across state and there are some questions at the beginning to get everything going but then we encourage everyone in attendance to interact and ask questions\nAnd just get the conversation going on we were talking just a moment ago are fair that I Love the way that you brought up the fact that the span of community isn't monolithic and it's certainly not monolithic when it comes to opinions and ideas and so what's great about this is that you do have this gathering of people from across the state and this is a chance for folks from Rochester\nInteracting tap into that knowledge and be part of the conversation\nOkay you mentioned marketing for example a business is marketing to Hispanic population that's one idea what are some of the other specific break out your themes that we're going to say\nSure so or some of the other ones are some of the ones that I've come to mind right away the sticking in the business practice one is about ... to the entrepreneur as\nA and that's a big issue uh Rochester is actually a there's been a couple of studies that show rushes last in the United states and non Hispanic entrepreneurship when we normally over index tremendously and the rest of the country\nUm and that's one of those problems that we talk about the summit being put together to deal with because there are certain issues that are\nEndemic in particular to the Hispanic community in upstate New York Rochester's dead last buffalo in Syracuse are not far behind in I'm In that study interestingly enough we have the highest per capita income for um for Hispanics and in the United states according to the same survey so\nThere's other issues there that that are unique to the area of some of the other workshops just beyond I'm a economic development we also have issues on um education so we have like a very interesting worshipped is going to be talking about\nUh the differences between public schools and public charter schools and how they deal with Hispanic students getting students into college so like you know that the weather you know cause pipeline getting folks in schools um all these issues\nOkay when it comes to education Hilda what do you see is the most significant and again these are hard questions to answer when we talked broadly about Latino or Hispanic community in this country but education um we in the city of Rochester for example\nWe have a number of challenges for students who are picking up English as a second language for example trying to make sure that they are um up to different standards by third grade seventh and eighth grade et cetera how do you see education as ... as an issue here\nUm you know and that is an issue I K sharing his being an area that we have been working and focusing on for years\nA and actually we partner with them ... school of education and we need a they did a study about\nUh the Latino issues in the city school district and the dropout rate and the lack of achievement and um so and we came up with some recommendations\nUm there's a lot of ways that you could look at why you know Latinos and Hispanics would be naturally more progressive and naturally more\nConservative Maria's email tells us do she always considered self self reliant and she's proud of that and that is a very powerful and frankly an American ideal but I don't think conservatives have a monopoly on but at the same time there's a lot of\nUm sort of conservative um fabrics\nWrapped up in that idea and then there's a question of the collective and certainly the people of Puerto Rico every exemplified this better than any other Americans recently I think the way they came together post Maria the power of the collective looking out for one another and you see communities whether it's\nUm whether it's a celebrations and festivals et cetera where that collective spirit is there so I think there's good reason to think that people Hispanic and Latino backgrounds would be all kinds of different political ideologies and I'm frankly not surprised to see it's not a model if when it comes to American politics\nFair enough but I Do think I Would ... and I look at each other disbelief and I I Do think because the Hispanic community is um it's very intricate I don't know if maybe there's some skewing in that\nData so you're thinking about the actual number of support slower I if I Do my my anecdotal ... I guess would be that if a lot less okay held her\nYeah I I Believe that he said last I I'm really surprised um but I think that those results are skilled\nAnd just to kind of put a final point 'cause I didn't mean to be snarky I'm with Andrew about Trump in terms of business [noise]\nIt just read the New York times recent a piece of extensive piece twelve month investigation and\nInto the tax history of Donald Trump and his father I mean Donald Trump has shown that a great way to end up with a hundred billion dollars just to start with five hundred billion he's lost a lot of money he needed four hundred plus million dollars from his father not one million not ten million four hundred plus million\nMuch of it criminally sort of set up in a way that I did probably pass statute of limitations but it's stuff that I couldn't get away with so um it's not very impressive his business record is not very impressive\nUm but in terms of his policy I understand why people like Andrew say hey his policies outwardly friendly to big business I take that point\nUm so let's let our guests kind of start to wrap it up a little bit here we've got the upstate Latinos are coming up next Wednesday October seventeenth at the Rochester riverside convention center from any um to four pm we've covered a lot of ground here who your what do we missed your what stands out to you that you're excited about that we kind of didn't get to\nGet sidetracked every time we come here [laughter] and what's good great conversations that I Would just say that it's just a really exciting opportunity um you did mention this is something that only comes roster every few years\nUm so it's a unique opportunity for people to um get a great background them Hispanic community whether you're Hispanic or not uh and and all kinds of fields so regardless of what the career that you're in the great opportunity to come and learn a lot okay he'll do what do you most excited about\n'em down this thing that we didn't speak about it they are why we start that is something that she had in the ... upstate city and that was because\nAh I ... we saw that in New York City there was this conference big conference and they continuously ignore upstate maybe they think that there was any Latinos not state so we came together a lot to bring the whole upstate to gather\nA to discuss our issues because I'm In some way they act different than the ones down state\nHow many people you're expecting next Wednesday oh well maybe six hundred people so\nWe haven't been launching a and when I luncheon and fiftieth anniversary so we have a over six hundred people and then there are some individuals that wouldn't be going just to uh to the workshop\nAnd thirty seconds to ... any people who are coming specifically or any names you want to mention who are going to be here some of the leaders or at least the sectors and the community\n[noise] well uh we have lots of business owners from across the state it's really hard because we have over thirty five speakers ... so it's just people from ... the entire I'm very proud of how inclusive we are with having people from across upstate New York\nA wheel so and and I forgot to mention that the city of Rochester is hosting this event with us so\nThey may may here with me there\nAnd and they sent politicians look back on line where one more time where I Am ... or by eight A.

them with the photo journalist find them coming [noise]\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm neurons President Trump is again criticizing the Federal Reserve board for raising interest rates calling it a ridiculous policy\nOf interest rates going up on his lip that's much faster than certainly a lot of people including myself would have anticipated I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nThe president said he knows more about interest rates then members of the Federal Reserve but he said he does not intend to fire fed chairman Jerome Powell in the past twenty four hours the president has also called the Federal Reserve board crazy and logo the director of the national economic council Larry Kudlow that said the president is not trying to dictate policy to the fed\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again at a December meeting analysts say it's not likely that will change because of today's report that the consumer price index rose one tenth of a percent last month\nThe federal emergency management agency says it's focusing on search and rescue in the Florida Panhandle today as now tropical storm Michael ... northeast over the Carolinas NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nAdministrator Brock Long says it appears that the town of Mexico beach was ground zero for the storm he says his agency is working with the national guard and first responders to access the area\nToday is a big day for us uh when it comes to a truly helping people to try to ah prevent for the loss of life as a result of of you know what the Gulf Coast has\nBeen through an estimated nine hundred thousand customers are without electricity in the region\nLong says FEMA is also studying a tree ... shutters or several hospitals are out of commission the storm is tracking through the Carolinas today and whether a specials are warning of possible tornadoes and more flooding in an area still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month\nWow way we we have the right idea\nUm and just ironically as we were putting the show together we were going through the campaign and so we knew that whatever the outcome as the presidential campaign was going to be that there was some currency to this history\n[noise] that it would inspire people\nTo either celebrate in November or start to look at things in another\nWay and in fact this is now all been proven to us that\nThese previous you know most of activism has definitely inspired a new generation\nI mean I think this country is sort of over this whole idea that will be post racial I mean how many times you heard during the Obama presidency that we were moving into a post racial America First of all obviously that's not the case and second of all you go back to the images in this in this exhibit and it wasn't that long ago\nAnd I chose to open the hour what some of the images that that hit like a hammer to me if people holding these watermelons proudly mocking the just the ugliest status stuff that I can really think of\nAs well I'd like to speak to that that particular moment and picture for a second I um\nI was very gung ho about including that picture and the show because of that kind of dirty iconic relevance of the watermelon\nI also knew that a generation or two younger than us was not going to know what the watermelon meant\nAnd I felt like we were giving people a little bit of an education about racist iconography and how\nPeople use objects like the watermelon to forward their ideas and it's a really brilliant picture and there's a lot of aggression and emotion in it and it's the kind of picture that you know I'm\nEvery picture tells a story right I mean there there is a story in that picture there are a thousand words and that and that in that moment and it shows you\nThe power of photo journalism and how it can teach us in how we can look at the past and try and make change\nTheir such as vitriolic pride that the people wielding these watermelons had that it's hard to even believe\nI you know it it shouldn't be hard to believe I I'm I'm not naive anymore it's not hard to believe we still would see that today and in many quarters of the country but for listeners to to make a point to look for younger listeners who are not familiar with this usage of of\nA of a watermelon it was Nineteen Ninety seven\nThat a golfer of color won the masters Tiger Woods wins the masters by twelve shots in Nineteen Ninety seven and a place that's one of the most racist\nSporting Venus in our country's history and fuzzy Zeller who was a past champion said well you know it's no big deal next year tell them at the champion dinner to serve collard greens and watermelon and [laughter] I mean it's amazing just amazing that was Nineteen Ninety seven not that long have you know of course he did apologize\nBut that was that was used as a way to to insult to demean to hurt and right and the images that you've collected here are very sad\nUm devastating I think in many ways to go but but here we are magazine do feel like maybe ... maybe it's not that long ago maybe people wouldn't use watermelon today but that same sentiment is really powerful today\nNot only is that same sentiment really powerful it's I think because of the ubiquity of social media it is multiplied and more intense and we talked about this earlier about the experience of seeing these things happen in real time\nAnd then seeing the vestiges of it and how it plays itself out culturally Charlottesville was a perfect example I think\nWe all knew that they are the country was coming to a boiling point when it came to racism but I think that in many ways we thought we have progressed from the sixties and that moment in Charlottesville showed us than in fact\nWe have in progress that much with this is a very dark moment in in the culture and we all saw it happening in real time like we were all there right\nThere there's something very different about that experience versus looking at pictures that are Thirty years old on the wall there's ... there's a distance that we have from the watermelon 'cause that's not now that that's Nineteen Ninety seven that's Brooklyn it's not here\nCharlotte's all I think changed all of that well\nLet me ask all three of you know several Joseph Rodriguez so your um this exhibit these images\nI think bring to mind the kind of the ongoing conversation that a lot of people in the activism community to the extent that there is a single activism community in this country\nHad been having for about two years now which is is it enough to demonstrate isn't enough to Mars now I think the obvious answer people could have come to you know you can't you show up one day a year in March and then go home and nothing changes you have to work but a lot of the people who are captured in the images in this exhibit aren't just demonstrating\nThey have done to work and yet in a lot of ways\nThere's not a whole lot of change and\nAnd I wonder if this exhibit then is mildly discouraging for people who wanted to see that change or if there are lessons to draw what do you see there are just as\nWell that can er can a reference the images that are in my mind images that are in the show which are images of of a Spanish Harlem east Harlem and um you know the folks there were desperate to to get\nTheir voices heard this was crack\nWas happening at the time aids was happening at the time racism was definitely prolific in our city growing up as a Puerto Rican New Yorker I felt that my whole life um and ... and so teenage all the teenage pregnancy unemployment\nAnd ... what was interesting about the community that I've photographed was they would also go out nightly\nTo to showcase a weed dishes gentrification these are things that are issues that happening those issues are still happening right now right now in the same neighborhood in in our city and so\nI I think that the photographs that we have in the show I think mine are from ... remember was in the in the eighties and and I'm\nStill relevant today is that's that I find mind boggling really the people in the community are still fighting the fight and as myself as a as a documentary photographer that's been my my path for the last forty years mind boggling but it's sad\nSad but you know they're not they're not giving up meaning they're still out there to fight the fight so you know and I just came back from Puerto Rico it's the same there and so you know in the community that I've photographed in Spanish Harlem is very much connected to Puerto Rico so it is a desert lineage that comes from this this sort of\nColonial eyes way of of of doing politics with a certain group\nOf people so are the fight still just goes on ... ... thing\nCan can you ask the question [laughter] I I'm I'm going to ask you not just what you think about\nWhether the this exhibit ought to induce a little sadness that change has been slow or if if if if there's something that you want viewers to take from that either lessons or ideas to take from taking in these images yeah I mean I think\nI think that there's a little bit of sadness when when you think wow I mean we're we're still fighting for reproductive rights or neighborhoods in New York are still getting gentrified or you know I mean you could say I probably something critical about each and every one of those um\nSocial issues but I in fact take inspiration from this show and I would like everybody to be inspired by this and to see the passion and enthusiasm and commitment that all of these activist and photographers possess\nTo be out on the streets to you know I think that's something people don't really think about and we can use the Kavanaugh\nProtest is that as an example you know every day that people are in Washington taking over the Hart building they're not at work\nThey're taking a day off work or they're taking a day away from their children or they're making some kind of compromise to be in D. C. to make their voices heard to put their bodies on the line\nAnd to me it's one of the most admirable things you can you can do is to go put you know put yourself out there\nTo try and make change to try and make a statement and does it happen in one going to one protester to protests no it happens over time it happens\nIn multiple groups with multiple disciplines with multiple things to bring to the table were image makers that's that's our contribution you know the person who makes the signs who Donald Trump made fun of\nWorks in a basement in the East Village with her own printing press making these signs every single day and giving them to people I personally I admire that that's hard core activist and to me and these are the people that are in our in the pictures in our show\nAnd we often forget about that a actual organizing and how do you even know about what's going on in the first thing comes down to research and you can activity as communities\nBut on a day to day basis whereas the march and when is it happening you know you take a Facebook out of the equation and Twitter and Instagram and\nNobody would know how to communicate with each other today and these guys had a system that worked very well at the time um we also are one of the things we did in the Bronx documentary center as we we tasted about half the exhibit on the streets\nAnd we've near that at all righty there's a dozen or so pictures we pasted on the side of some of the brick buildings there to sort of written back to that time of of communication on the on the streets on the buildings themselves\nJournal and I and I want to add about the wheat pasting and and what we did in the Bronx I'm\nYou know we felt like we really wanted to show to be democratic and you know not everybody's comfortable walking into a white cue kind of gallery and\nUm we pacing around the neighborhood was a great way to show the work to people who might have even been at those demonstrations or their relatives were there they have some connection to it\nBut they never walk in a gallery and so\nThat's I think and I and I think at R. I. T. I'm you know not every student might walk in the gallery I mean I'd like to think that they will but it just gives another layer of the experience to people like I said it's it's democratize is that how many images are there at the\nGallery there's I Would say a close to Seventy images and then there's another uh twenty plus images that gallery cues so we're pretty close to about a hundred images total said it's a very big show\nWho's streets our streets is what we're talking about uh two streets dot photo\nAnd if our guest don't mind I'd like to ask them to maybe choose one to describe for our listeners in to some degree there's a risk this is a an audio medium we can't see it but I think from your perspective I'd like to hear what stands out to you as a way for describe because at the top of the hour again I mentioned an image\nWas was broken watermelons littering the streets and vents and Hearst after an anti racism march and just how ugly and devastating and just to see an image like that I thought it was so powerful\nThere are so many different subjects that this exhibit touches on race relations police brutality aged queer activism war environmentalism and a lot more um Joseph is there one that comes to mind\nFor you well for me it was it was more about working with a deacon ... who's a who's a deacon by\nOn a sunny Saturday Sunday and I spend a lot of time with him because he was also an activist he was a barber by day so by by in his barber shop he would just talk to people that would come in\nAnd I'd be sitting there and I listen and he said look I have a demonstration tonight so and then I didn't know what that demonstration was looked like but he was heading the demonstration with a crucifix and on the crucifix kind of\n... or nailed into the cross we're all the social issues that they were there to to\nTo demonstrate for and I just always found out to be quite powerful because\nYou know sometimes demonstrations can lean towards just one issue but they were smart enough to put this altogether because in Spanish on they've had this kind of religious activism for a long time every Good Friday you can do any anybody wants to see this every year you can go up there every Good Friday to have this huge procession throughout the streets of Spanish Harlem\nWhere they go to all the different churches but they don't just stop to pray they stopped to talk about the issues that are\nThat are troubling and and and and the challenges that they face in their community I thought that that was quite remarkable ... may\nOh you're putting me a message and um [noise]\nWell one of ... [laughter]\nThe curator of the show it's hard to you know pick out one a photo by it I think one of the pictures that I think is really powerful is that Tom governs photograph of\nA a gentleman carrying the coffin of a a activist or Jon Greenberg um one at one of the things that was ... who died of aids um [noise]\nOne of the things that started happening in the streets of New York where these things called political funerals and and they were done by the request of the deceased So Jon Greenberg wanted his body carried through the streets of the East Village\nTo make a point about you know aids education funding\nAnd you know all of the issues that were surrounding HIV and AIDS and at the time and that ACT UP was working so hard to get funding to get people to understand what this disease was\nAnd if you think about it today the idea of walking a coughing up first avenue is I don't know I mean I don't know if that's something that people can\nCan conceive of that it was a very powerful\nStatement to make 'em and Tom who was a photographer and also a photo editor at the village voice I did a lot of documentation", "show_name": "Connections with Evan Dawson Hour 1", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "11"}
