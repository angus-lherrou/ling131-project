NPR News the state department\nEvacuation orders are underway as hurricane Michel heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast officials say it's expected to make landfall as a major category three storm FEMA associate administrator and Jeff ... says infrastructure damage in power outages can be expected\nOr a K. Mart who's going to be a devastating storm that Israel fought a Florida is not finished all of this magnitude in quite some time\nBuyer and says it is a fast moving high surge storm with very very powerful wins\nAnd it could also produce tornadoes he warns damage to the power structure could be more significant than Florence emergency officials across the Carolinas they're also warning residents to monitor hurricane Michael which is likely to move through the states after coming ashore [noise]\nThe death toll from an earthquake and tsunami in central Indonesia has topped two thousand as NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from ... near the epicenter the government is ending the search for more bodies and ordering foreign aid agencies out\nBeginning in my addiction issues started did you drink hard it right away um parties on the weekends you know we just we drank\nAnd then in the week days even back to normal lives but that only lasts for so long\nWas there a time soon thereafter that you thought you were out of control or did you always think you had control of the\nUm [noise] I\nPicked out of control pretty quick and I was well aware of that um when I started college next semester and I I realized that um school work and addiction issues don't really mashed very well and I wanted to actually start to drink full time so I dropped out of college\nYou dropped on the couch to dream in um did you have people in your life telling you this is\nA nobody in my life at this point really knew the extent of which I was doing it it was I was hiding it pretty well at this point\nWhere you drinking I'm sort of privately so either and in cars and other places where people were seeing you\nKnow at this point I'm going out with my friends like every night a week and partying with them so it's definitely not private more of a public thing but it was every day at this point\nOkay but what happened last year that put you in the motor kind of job wasn't necessarily related to the alcohol right so how when did you end up doing 'cause I think your story takes you to heroin ... how did you get there\nWell um\nI started with the drinking because I was driving a vehicle and I was so drunk that I was being really stupid and I decided to see how fast my car can go a long story short I had a ... I had a tree going Ninety five miles an hour I woke up in the hospital and um hang up to the bad but after I got released they gave me a tradition for opioid painkillers\nAnd that didn't addiction ... you know take over right then it\nIt's very gradual at this point because um I started taking those pills and then I realized that you know you take more of them and you start to feel a little better so I started to take more and more and then they have they have less of an effect on the more you take so\nI had to keep it in a stronger substances and eventually led me to heroin and when I actually went on to a detox center at this point and everybody in the detox center told me I needed to dry heroin or if I was doing all these pills so by the time I left detox man everyone was telling you that I mean other patients into these acts under that Haitians\nWere telling you you need to heroin and you went out and found\nWhen I left a detox center I had every intention of staying clean until I cross the threshold of those doors and the first of all through my mind was I Need to try this at all the patients are recommending it I mean that's just the way my mind that point when was that by the way we're uh [noise] I Can't I was probably eight or nine years ago\nIt was All right and so so it's been a while but ... and what did you find in terms of your own um either ability to handle heroin or your desire for it did you use regularly from that point on\nI'm ... from the first time I use heroin that was a regular thing yes um and it\nAs as steal their sole honestly it gets to a\nPoint where it becomes automatic and it takes over all the priorities in my life because\nUm when you don't have it you get so sick and the physical withdrawals from heroin are are so intense that I'd be willing to do anything to make that go away and so right then and there are all memorials go out the window and heroin become the only thing I'm thinking about\nDid you have moments over the ensuing eight or nine years where you really did want to get yourself fried of it\nI'm almost every night I Would tell myself this is enough I I mean I'm going to die if I keep on his way but then every single morning as soon as I Would open my eyes and I would feel that pain from the withdrawal set in my mind but just go straight back to how am I going to get my next fix\nAll right so you end up last year in a situation where Brandon I were talking before the program began because the before and after picture that that maybe you're looking at on a very social media feeds 'em rent really looks like a different person\nAnd but it was early in last year that you had a moment where you thought you know you need to tell your family you may not you maybe go on to what was going on early and twenty Seventeen\nUm are your friends when I was in the hospital yeah yeah oh okay I was admitted to Armstrong hospital um I don't remember how like over the last thing I remember was being taken out of the apartment\nI was in on a stretcher and then I woke up in ICU about a week later I was told that I had been in a coma the whole time\nUm I had a a blood infection which traveled to all over my body I gave me an infection in my heart and in my brain and I spent a total of Seventy seven days in the hospital and I came so close to dying that when I was first admitted they told my mother to prepare herself for the fact that I'm probably not going to make it back to the hospital\nDid you have conversations with your mother to to fully understand what was going on and\nUm I Believe she did um [noise] I don't know like there's been certain times where I think that I hit it well enough from her her but then there's other times I think moment she she had to know can I ask how do how do you view your relationship with your family\nUm today I mean my relationship with my mother is very good today but um I Try to most of my family alone for the most part considering I band and you know falling in their side for so long now I tried to give them space at this point [noise]\nUm but I can always reach out and talk to them and that and they're very proud of me today\nSo that's tremendous self awareness but the work that you're doing we're going to talk in a minute about dealing hope and some of the work that you're doing is part of recovery so I imagine they are very proud of you because you go through out last year your family's warned that they may need to be prepared for the fact that you're going to be gone\nUm you you survived that Seventy seven days day but you end up back in front of a judge on September twenty six and he puts you in jail and you have written that that was the best thing that happened for you to take me through that\nI was a part of a drug court and I only took a drug court because I wanted the freedom to be able to continue to use but I didn't realize that and the jail pretty quick so I um I get sentimental county jail on September twenty six and at this point in my state of mind is telling me just to comply with whatever they need me to do\nSupport for W. argue our digital media comments from our members\nAnd from ... a small batch ... brewery located on railroad street where fermentation meets flavors like ginger beat and more open to the public on Saturdays from tend to to what growl are available to go on line at cat boots ... dot com\nI stopped\nThinking I knew everything and I started to realize I knew nothing so I was open to being guided\nWow what did you need to learn most\n[noise] um [noise] how to\nHow to stay occupied and not want to use drugs and alcohol because um as far as long as I can remember I've always needed you know social lubricant to have fun so um activities with sober people and sober environments was definitely a very big\nAmerica how did you find these guys how'd you find recovered [laughter] [noise]\nI'm recovering fitness came into the facility I was in an inpatient and I actually didn't get to attend\nThe meeting I think I was asleep and nobody woke me up\nBut all the patients were coming back from the meeting and they were talking about it like for hours and I was like I got a check this place out when I leave and that's exactly what I did now were you somebody growing up did you work out much grown up no no I was the exact opposite actually I was a bookworm I was with a computer guy I majored in IT like a\nComplete one eighty meeting and now I Would I people will meet you probably assume you played quarterback on the football team you ran track you know know lifted I'm so that was new to you yes and I'm I'm Wondering how much you Wade\nThese photo essays miss a whole side of the story in the end the portrait painted as so stark in dire that not only does it not reflect the current reality it feels like a representation that could end up being harmful for people living with addiction who want to get better\nBut feel helpless and hopeless and people who have overcome their addictions are an important part of the crisis Dr Nora Volkow\nDirector of the national Institute on drug abuse best explained why in her recent piece for Scientific American she wrote quote viewing addiction as a treatable medical problems from which people can and do recover\nIs crucial for enabling a public health focused response that ensures access to effective treatments and lessons the stigma surrounding condition that afflicts nearly ten percent of Americans at some point in their lives and quote\n... how do you feel about that or do you think that too much of the media focus by\nEither social media or news media is focused on what Segal and slate says is will be a disaster porn as opposed to the recovery side\nI Do I'm buying\nThe gauging the recovery piece um you're showing people that there really isn't hope and the truth is there's a whole different way of life for\nFor us in these people who are out there are still struggling\nMariano how do you feel about\nThe um I haul hide how high deadly agree Neal an article and you read the heading yeah I'm I've read I shared at I think it's focusing on the problem is going to a great to make the problem worse when you focus on ... do you believe this recovery\nThe recovery get stronger meeting somewhere in the article that talks about you know when you look at cancer does the media shell ethic dying of cancer patient and you've got the message of health or is the message of hope a person that over comes in is in remission from cancer to brand him\nYeah I mean I see the media does cover of the problem a lot more than this loose in the ghetto was saying but um\nThat's one of the biggest things that I think all of us try to do is focused more on the solution and then the problem a lot of the speakers that I hear and try to ease up on the war stories and how they were before and focus more on the ads are part in recovery just for this reason\n[noise] yeah I take the point I mean I think if we were to just share Brandon's photos before photos which are really gripping and and hard to look at really and not share the stories now your fitness your recovery your health\nThat would be a problem at the same time I think I think there has to be a balance and I think the recovery community as part of the balance the the hope that comes from knowing that recovery is going to be difficult but but you can do this is important and it's also not a perfect straight line and I will I Will share that I was at um\nAt the recovery fitness five K. a few weeks back\nUp near Lake Ontario as you mentioned five six hundred people came out it was great and you know Sean of one of the reasons I reached out in and called these guys was showing us telling the story about recovery and you shared a very hard story about ... and\nUm I don't want to take the words out of your mouth but I think part of what you were saying was relapse as part of recovery and don't let people\nYou know tell you otherwise and and I I was hoping you could share that story um with our audience today sure\nUm I've been in recovery since two thousand ten [noise]\nUm and it's been a a a bumpy and rocky road um and I have bounce back from several relapses I'm right now\nI'm coming up on six months you know um when ... founded recovery almost four years ago I didn't suspect that I'd ever relapse again um and for for it to happen again\nWhen I did trip up and and did relapse um it was just as painful as all the other times that I had um I felt that shame that re Morse that guilt and I didn't want to face\nThe world I was drinking alone in a hotel room I'm essentially wishing for death um it had gotten to that point and it got to that point in a span of four day\nUm it was just me alone in a hotel room in a bottle of vodka\nAnd\nYou know if I didn't know recovery was possible you know if I hadn't been there already\nI think I'd be you know I'm\nLike you said you know you see this bleak picture painted out there of what the disease of addiction looks like you drive down the expressway and you see the faces of math\nYou know um these big billboards with people's faces destroyed by drug addiction um and I know in their recovery as possible and that I had a group of people that I could reach out to um\nI wouldn't be here playing simple can you\nTake us through what you decided to do who reached out to and what the response to your relapse was\n[noise]\nI [noise] it was more of them reaching out to me really um they knew that I was in a\nBad space um and I just started receiving multiple phone calls and tax saying hey you can do this let me come and get you let me come and talk to 'em and it was the people\nThat really cared for me that rallied around me it was just it was this group of people that I had known either for years or that I had met Iraq coverage that kind of just rallied around\nMe and and put me back on my feet and actually walked me into detox um drove me down to detox and ah [noise] in ... New York at the VA facility there\nDid you feel in some sense that the shoe was on the other foot because you've been playing that role for others for a number of years now through recovering\n[noise]\nA big part of my recovery of service work and you know provide me with that sense of purpose and and yeah I think everybody that's in recovery has that need to give\nBack you know because we've been there and you when you see somebody in so much pain is just natural to want to help them um and I'm just fortunate enough that I have a crew of people that want to do that for me\nWhat message are you feeling like has to be shared regarding relapse because you know Brandon story and I think it's important to kind of mentioned again Brandon story\nHe hit recently hit a year and initially didn't think much of it because he's actually had cleaner period longer periods that he's been clean 'em and and so he understands that relapse is part of it but I think for people who are going to be entering this for the first time\nThere may be a concern that relapses failure or relapse is the end relapse takes you into a ... totally different space\nI think each time that I relapsed I did feel that initial failure I'm\nIn time you know I was able to build the strength and realized that I have the resilience to bounce back\nUm I have the strength within me demands back and I have the support to help me and guide me along the way and just as long as I showed the humility and and willing to take some suggestions from the people that love me I'll make to the place where I'm supposed to be um so anyone that does fall flat in the face again and does relapse\nDon't look at you know a failure it don't look at relapse as a failure um you know I I I heard the speaker say something that really stuck with me after this last ... it was felt forward you know don't fell backwards you know when\nWhen you do fall down get up keep moving forward um find that people who have supported you in the past and are going to support in the future and and walk down the road with you um you can if you did it before\nAnd do it again and you know I I think there's this big push for people in recovery to remain ... and I think that's awesome I think it's essential but relapse does happen and when it does happen\nI don't view it as a failure necessarily you know it's it's a learning opportunity for me you know I'm just not done yet I'm I have more to learn so hopefully I've learned everything that I Need to learn from this last relapse\nAnd or I'm going to continue to do what I've always done 'em and and that's ... and the people around me and listen to them\nAt rock debris you've gotten to know you and you're on a special gotten to know so many names and faces um\nAnd there's a lot of great success stories and you guys are sort of the pillar of some of those success stories I Know you're not going to take all the credit for it but I hear all the time from the recovery community how much credit they give to you for that\nHave you also had moments of loss have you had moments where you know you have to get the news that um it does either been a relapse or worse\nYeah um\nSeveral times and there was a period where it seems like every month we're getting the news or once a week at times that we're getting the news that another person that passed and you know I lost my best friend um in March of two thousand Seventeen\nUm when I was down I was down in Georgia training for the best ranger competition and I got the news and I immediately flew back to be a part of his funeral and that probably out of all the law says that won't hit me the hardest one because ... was one of our founding members that recovering\nI'm and I'm too it's you know I just always envision a future with him and\nThat's the way it is with everyone that walks through our doors I don't see them you know ... and think oh this person's going to pass away you know I always envisioned a future when so which was really is hard but when you see the people that are living in recovery\n[noise] it makes the mission worth it um and when you see the family members the families of loss um it also makes our mission all the more worthwhile 'em to memorialize those that were lost and living there on her [noise]\nAnd will be will what will be will what is what will be\nIs that how you kind of felt about it my that was a little bit more literal for me\n[laughter] I was\nLiterally down three quarters of death and and I'm like well I probably stop one wants to needle starts to come up I guess I Want to get more and I like I Do notice though that this is the new you and sobriety yeah and it's also complete ...\nChange I don't I don't think the same way anymore\nHow what are the other ways in your life do you think you you think differently now in sobriety versus when\nI'm addicted I have a positive\nAttitude today and I had something I've never really ever had in and that comes from the people I'm surrounded by that are also a positive attitudes and it changes the who I surround myself with because editors are contagious and I think I've only recently actually realize that\nSo I have to surround myself with positive people because negativity rubs off to\nWell I ... and maybe this is an important point to squeeze in an email from Eric who was just asking can you help someone who isn't ready to be helped you kind of touched on that briefly with some of the friends of the people around you that you see who are in the position now that you were in before\nBut what you said on this program as you don't often know what to do you do know how to help them if they're not ready can you help someone if they're not really ready for it\nI'm honestly I'd have to say I mean you\nProbably not they have to want for themselves they have to hit the low point where you've you've had enough I I Know I had to I didn't get the message into I had to go through what I went through was sitting in a jail so nobody to go and go into the worst pain in my life like I had to go through that I really believe\nYou can you help someone who isn't really ready for it\nAnd he gets more as not having regrets so letting them know that you're there for them you less than a whether it's from Jeff in whether it's just being available to the person and getting help for yourself as the person you're trying to help\n'em and you're not you can't change somebody else's mindset and that you can just be there and whenever that looks like whatever that means for the individual gets to be present in their support if they need ...\nI think we're there to plant a seed um whether they're ready or not um and also if you're living in recovery just lead by example you know if they see you live in a right life\nA fun life I'm a life that's worth living um they may jumped to the other side of the fence you know and ask you hey how you get this way I'm just wrap your arms around them when they when they do decide to ...\nKnow that words actually I think probably really important is is fun such as healthy in you're enjoying life\nAnd what your modeling at least certainly looks like a recovering and all the events that you do and brand and ... just kind of checking out what you're doing now um I I imagine it it takes\nSomeone who is seeing that and it makes them realize it's not just that I can get cleaner get into recovery but I might actually enjoy life is hard when you're in the throes of addiction to envision yourself happy again shown\nIt is and you know twelve years ago I wouldn't equate that to where it's fun and sober [laughter] um but now you know when I did get clean\nThat's what I did I took it back to when I was a kid and that's what we do on these walks on these kayaking trips on these mountain trips are on these camping trips everything that we do you know we've kind of taken aback to argue and then taken back to when we were having fun without substances\nAnd she just showing that the world that recovery as possible and it's not just passport but it's a whole lot of fun too\nIf you want to contact recovery

Jennifer for from your work with Paul what's happening right now and where do you see progress or frustration\nSo a couple of things our prevention is well prevention from a little bit different aspects of it and see ADD what we focus in on is\nCommunity organizing bringing the community to gather to collectively solve a problem we recognize early on that this is not a simple problem it's not going to be a simple solution\nSo often the media would ask what one thing could you do there's not one thing there's multiple multiple ways we can attack this problem and to do that we needed multiple sectors involved\nSo that was the purpose of calling together representatives from across our community early to Hassan sixteen for the ... task force ... county that still is alive and well meeting bi monthly so it's really about\nAbout that you know bringing bringing folks together with everyone with the same objective to increase access increase access across the board that's what we focus on we early ...\nSome of our own barriers and certainly there were multiple ... we also early indentified what would we like to see and the biggest message was increased access so that not one more person needing treatment would hear the message come back and uh we come back in a month\nSo we focus on prevention and treatment and recovery resources so see organizing community education\nSo we're we've I you know trained over like not at this point several thousand people in a variety of Venus so that's working with the community community education educating families\nI've got educators going into the school joined now to by Dr Mendoza his wonderful work and deputy chief advisor to his work so we've got multiple partners during this\nCommunity awareness taking advantage of every opportunity to do longer interviews with the media because I echo\nSentiments of the report or the ... the article you read in the earlier hour and the reaction from our three prior panelists if we're only to focus on the death and destruction of this horrendous\nIssue around around opioid center on heroines we're going to be a community T of hopelessness and helplessness so I've taken every opportunity to focusing on\nAll the access to services that we now have that we didn't have six months ago or a year ago they continue to expand access\nIs sometimes it's invasion sometimes without patient services um different people have different needs are different points in their process what are the biggest needs right now when you say you never want to see someone be told you gotta wait a week got away from what's it going to take in our community to get to that point where that doesn't\nImmediate access and we have that through some new services so let's focus on the person needing help\nThat would be access to a relatively new group which is open access it's not a new treatment site it's a site where one can do and get assessed evaluated\nAnd a so called bad or treatment slight be be a dental fight\nUh soon as possible available treatments site if there's insurance various as can be negotiated if there's transportation issues those can be helped as well and from the opening of open access which celebrated its one year anniversary just this past August there spend five new\nOpen access opportunities at five of our treatment providers who also have to walk and access to treat people\nKnow about this I mean it seems to me that if if if I have a family member has addict or have a friend or if I Know some they may not even if they're already they may not know where they can go is that part of it\nExactly so getting the word out and that's why I really appreciate it for a pre shade opportunities like this I I Wish I Wish every time the media talked about another death\nAnother overdose that they would parrot with the increased access it's it's such a different message is something that we're like we're turning a blind die or sugar coating what's happening around\nBut it's not prevent uh presenting any picture of health and hope if we don't accompany with all the additional resources so go wherever it's a few where would you send someone at for an access hoping accidentally access it's at university avenue it's co located with the new health which is a deep tax evaluations are\nOkay that's a great first step and we will stay on the subject of access throughout the hour that's part of the questions in the work the document does it has to deal with what's ah what's foremost on your mind is to deal with this\nWell you know I think it's very important to reflect on the fact we've had so much good collaboration in this community I mean you're looking at the collaboration between the medical community even within the medical community I mean you know years ago we would never of invasion of the two houses\nIt was getting together and working together on this a\nVery important a problem and we're seeing that right now I think that's a really a sign of of hope\nNow you're seeing collaboration between sectors you're seeing collaborations between law enforcement and medicine and the criminal justice system and the community and I think our job together as a community to figure out what is the role\nThat each of us can play that that can have a substantial impact on this problem or within the medical community alone um you know I think stigma Israel and I think a part of my role and I think it's perhaps a unique role for us you know the panels that I Know one of my goals is to try to eliminate the stigma that happens within our medical system\nYou know I've got colleagues who are still learning about addiction and to try to speaking their language to help them understand that addiction as a chronic illness and when we think about it and the same way as other kinds of illnesses\nThan we have a a model of care that we can wrap around it and then you know we're not starting from ground zero you know we're starting from a place where in this community we've we've got\nSo many interventions that are geared around how do we manage chronic illnesses how do we prevent people from going to the ER unnecessarily how do we keep them out of the hospital keep them in primary care to keep them at their work and their jobs and in their communities\nYou know that is the model that I'm trying to adapt to this new and very difficult problem\nStigma within the medical community essentially is it because a lot of the training that people get when they are becoming doctors this is a crisis that has kind of exploded in recent years maybe it wasn't part of the training wasn't part of the education when you were back in ...\nCertainly there's room for improvement and when I was in school and and and residency we we didn't have this very real problem to use as the jumping off point for learning about this very important topic but\nYou know as we learn more about it and the people in the field of known about this for for a long time but but that's not enough we need to find a way to bring addiction into the mainstream so to speak of regular health care\nAnd we've got a long way to go you know depression for many people as a mental illness that is not properly treated yet in the primary care and we've got to find a way to integrate mental health into primary care but the next step is to integrate substance use a care into primary care as well\nWhen it comes to stigma what's the possible um the risk if there is a stigma within the medical community about opioid addiction what happens to to patients and treatment\nOr you know the first thing we're taught as do no harm and you know our job as professionals as to to meet people where they are you know and regardless of what that is that whatever it is that they're going through it to meet people were there were they are and to not turn them away\nAnd if if I if I can imagine myself in the shoes of somebody who's struggling through addiction you know contemplating recovery you know it takes a lot of courage to share what we heard earlier in the in the past hour with a stranger\nAnd I take that responsibility very very heavily and for somebody to disclose that to a professional we have an obligation or to make sure that we hear them and listen to them and not judge them\nLess there's if you want to call the program and our second half hour we're going to take some questions from the audience right here in Studio um and if you want to call we can work in some of your feedback as well eight four four to nine five talk it's toll free eight four four to nine five eight to five five four to six three to ... Rochester\nTo six three nine nine nine for Jennifer fair and you mentioned a number of\nQuestions on ... an access to care\nOne of the the subjects that has come up both on past discussions on this program emails from listeners isn't church you briefly mentioned the jurors how are we doing now in making sure\nThat if I have an addiction and I have an opioid addiction\nThat my insurance is not going to cut off right when I'm moving into that crucial days because days and weeks are are humongous when we're finally ready to get treatment and we have heard stories and this is not my expertise but we've heard stories of well insurance only covers X or insurance won't help with this is that changing that getting any\nExtra why is spent on them and you don't necessarily know what though tell me a little bit more about your concern there\nWell that's the problem you know we are interesting you know for lack of a better word or the future of these individuals to people who really have no regard for their well being\nAnd if I'm a dealer I Want to continue my business and continue to supply and the person who's a struggling as just using drugs to feel normal\nYou know we're taught in medical school that you can't die from opioid withdrawal\nTend chemical that is true but we know in practice that is not true or it is so severe for people who are going through it that that some commit suicide\nAnd and that is that the the gravity of what we're dealing with what's withdrawal and so\nSo when people are struggling through this ah illness they will do whatever they possibly can and bread an exam Brandon's example earlier of of seeing the the gas tank on empty and and going further you know people who are struggling through addiction are doing the same thing they're just trying to to close by and ah and do what they can and we need to\nYou know that's why collaboration with law enforcement so important you know we can't solve this one from the from the safety of a hospital or clinic\nIs there a general estimate that law enforcement for the crime lab or analysts have that for every deck of heroin if that's the term that we see on the streets here what percentage of or or if they're for every hundred decks how many are cut with central I mean isn't isn't half as more\nKnowledge it's we're we're finding decks of cocaine or ... or what we would think heroin would feel touch them on the on the road\nSomewhere national looking heroin in the bag you know so we have no way of other products in her one of the profit margin you know they're making a profit on the ... way cheaper and you get a better profit margin than you cut it with other stuff uh and then just last week you know the I'm In Florida we the heroin task force\nTook all heroin off the streets you know so\n... that's the Russian roulette people are playing they don't know what they're buying they don't know who's produces as a doctor said there's someone at the other end of this manufacturing scheme that doesn't give a lick about them and we killed him in a second uh and and people in the addictive state or not hearing that reasonable talk that we we find sleep that's common sense why would you play that game\nUm but the point where Macon is you know we're testing bags on the street that there's no sometimes no heroin and the bag while according\nTo the national Institute on drug abuse among the more than Seventy two thousand drug overdose deaths estimated in twenty Seventeen the sharpest increase occurred among deaths related to fentanyl and central analogs\nWith nearly thirty thousand overdose deaths in that category so once again the email from Matt I appreciate that email met that's important and again sorry for your loss um if you want to email the program it's connection to W. ex excite dot org\nYou can call the program and our second half hour eight four four to nine five talk it's toll free aid for four to nine five eight to five five to six three to be ... in Rochester to six three nine nine nine for after our only break in the hour we're going to come back we'll have a question of our studio audience here wants to come to the Mike and\nUh with questions for sheriff Todd ...

things considered from NPR News\nTonight at seven\nWelcome back to connections I met the dos and again we're on Facebook Live in the W. exercise news page and we're at WXXI Saturday but were downstairs and our television studios are we've got a live audience here and we're going to turn now to the microphones are right here on the microphone please say your name and go ahead with your comment or question\nThank you for a very important program my name is Scott and a document those ah you said something that really resonated with me he said that the goal of medicine is first do no harm we hear that as being the\nThe um hallmark has medicine all the way around and we've heard from the sheriff about these um\nDealers who are really very in various and so forth peace we have not heard about in this particular segment is the\nMedical industry um Brandon's story that his path to opioid addiction was initiated in the medical establishment initiated with um\nOpioid prescribe pain medication and so many people are victim to the overuse of prescription opioids and the medical industry the profits from it what do we do about that\nMakes you a question you're absolutely right you know I and I think it's important wherever I go to to speak to an audience that I acknowledge that as a position as a member of the medical community that we played a very important role unfortunately\nUh in the genesis of this crisis and so uh as I see it you know one of the tenets of of our opioid action plan is through the advisory panel that I've convened\nTrying to educate my colleagues on the appropriate treatment of pain\nYou know we got into this uh unfortunately because we were trying to treat pain in a way that was a you know and now we know are not entirely safe\nAnd uh we we don't want to make that mistake again and so part of our work has to educate people about how to treat pain appropriately because we want to acknowledge that pain is very real to or we don't want to uh alienate those who struggled struggled through chronic pain 'cause that's a disease onto its own\nBut you're absolutely right you know I think it's important for us the medical community not to be defensive about this to own what what happened\nI acknowledge what what we did to potentially contribute to the issue and more importantly a figure out what we can do as a community and it's unfortunately not a solution that we can own entirely but uh there was a good part of it that we need to own and and that's part of Michael as much\nAs I Know you are certainly aware of people who are on pain medication for various reasons\nI think if people like my mother and they would be very fearful of living without the possibility of using an opioid for pain and um\nAnd I wonder what the message is for them because when they when we've had this conversation for in fact we had a a live broadcasts where we sign will cast it in Cleveland in Portland and Rochester\nAnd to just to the subject of pain management there's a lot of fear out there that this is going to result in eliminating opioids entirely um but I I Know I see you shaking your I Know you don't think we ought to eliminate opioids entirely for pain management\nBut generally speaking do you have an idea that it ought to be a lot less in terms of prescription we gotta try other methods first ... where do you think we're headed with\nThis well you know the CDC has come out with recommendations on how to a more appropriately treat chronic pain with opioids and their recommendation also is not to get rid of opioids completely it's to think about the individual patients think about the risks and the benefits of all the different treatments that we're going to consider for that individual\nUm but there is unfortunately no easy way to take care of an individual and so we've got to meet that person where they are but I I definitely acknowledge that there is significant fear and I feel it in the office when I see somebody with chronic pain\nYou know they're already on on eggshells because they're worried that I'm going to take away their opioids\nAnd the reality is that you know we need to consider people from the standpoint of what they're going through in ... and what their individual circumstances are\nMarried to an email from a listener named Stephanie who is in the audience today she says I'm so grateful to be in this audience I'm an addict in recovery from alcohol prescription pills and long term eating disorder I also have multiple college degrees a sex a successful career in business a family and friends around the world my point is that\nAddiction where's the face of every one is the great equalizer what are the opportunities for those of us in recovery to be involved in the recovery of others in the county can we make\nA those resources available from Stephanie it's a great question Jennifer alternative you on that\nYeah I Would say I mean you heard the devices time recovering fitness that's that's ... fitness become involved um work with them\nA court is another a drop in Centre located on west avenue you know those come right to the top of my head\nI'm certainly educate and help us work together to eliminate the stigma also in a community if you are part of the community coalition their school community based coalitions and what will for example ... and C D D is through our I think like prevention Research Center\nMy three staff support twenty coalitions and the finger lakes region doesn't school community based who's the focus is really to address the variety of addiction related issues in their communities so I Would certainly say that\nYou know how I take the time to become trained in North Canton ... particular age so if you come
