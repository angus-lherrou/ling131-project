TV reports that Saudi Arabia is no longer blocking Turkish police from searching all well on the grounds of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nYou know but now I Love the process actually of campaigning I really think that's fun I enjoy getting out and meeting people that fundraising tired of that definitely is a problem when I ran for family court judge the way I handled that was I sold the house that I had it was a rental income\nAnd with the money from that I paid for my TV commercials because in those days you really needed TV commercials\nI agree that judge chatter right now you don't really need the commercials and if you paid all the money to put together you wouldn't even know where to run it because there's so many stations out there now so social media is the place to be and meeting people a day to day wherever you go as it is the way to do that\nUm the part of it that's most troubling to me is that in New York we have a bunch of different party lines in the Democratic party we had a process that's pretty fair and open I think for the party to pick who wants to have run\nAnd I'm In this case I'm here late in the race because we really had trouble fielding a second person to run for that the two positions that are available now\nAnd I think it's really important that the voters have a choice a matter to me that we had a choice so that's why I came out of retirement to run so\nI'm On the line with a judge chat channel and I decided this time I'm not even gonna try to raise money last time I was ... there was a little bit of money I raised and it didn't really bother me that much either because when you're on different family court nobody's going to get it very much the people that appear in front of the rich lawyers that are going to\nHave a lot of money to get the aside raised a little and I paid for the rest of myself and\nI was fortunate to be in a position to do that it is unfortunate the elections are publicly funded that would be the best that they are publicly funded that does take money\nYeah I'm On the money said let me just follow up by saying that you know I opened with the story of soup ... in Alabama where the rules are a little different in Alabama would be judges are allowed to ask for money directly and as we're again as Radley horrified okay you would never want to have to do that at the heart okay so so in in ... then that distinction we have an advantage you're right\nBut what I I understand intellectually voters who are struggling with this idea that even though you can't ask for money directly\nYou can be in a fundraiser you can see people in the room lawyers are there what about putting up a wall sooner lawyers active lawyers cannot give money to to judicial campaigns you have no\n... I think that will never work if you actually want lawyers running for office to raise money I mean who's going to get money to people who are running so it's an inherent problem I don't know that we have a solution for it because you don't also like just the wealthy to run for office that's not a good idea so I think that's happening now is it's\nAnd in private practice hair and a famine dedication and that was almost entirely state Supreme Court litigation so then the court that I'm running for an hour I did that for love or four years and then I went kiddy appellate division which is the court right about the trial court that ...\nAnd die so that was all relevant to the work at it they doing as a state Supreme Court judge\nAnd after that I was really lucky I got hired by out really well respected an honorable ... and the really amazing thing about getting hired by hand life he had me in part because I was a woman and he was a man and he thought that was being balanced as decisions that because they do a lot of divorce work in\nSpace by any author hired me because I was a Democrat and have as a Republican and he thought that would also be balanced as decisions that I was really fortunate that kind of thing doesn't seem to happen much anymore\nI'm and she worked hard he loved the loudly rarely had lunch we tried to do everything right that's what you do when you did a lot on the politics who gave the money had didn't get the money that really is irrelevant if you're doing the job right and I think lost touch as really our\nCell I worked hard and long let him and I'm enjoyed it very much and they're like I was a lot that for\nJudge O'Connor and family quite and that's when I learned I really love family clock because I hadn't had much experience at all in family court and after that I can attach for ten years and and part of my ten years of the family court judge I was an acting Supreme Court judge tests I've had an immense amount of experience right in the part that I Want to serve okay\nJudge stretching you I was born in the run the white um Catholic schools um ... high school's Colgate University in Albany law school a middle school and um [noise]\n'em and he got better okay uh and he is turned his life around completely round is no role model for young men are in Rochester so people do get better in corrections does a a very good job with the resources they are\nBut I Know that you're not a minimalist in that you're not someone who thinks well don't let them study don't let them learn to let them take classes it should be punitive you know ... those are luxuries\nAs I said they get out of jail and have to be reintegrated back into society they've got families that they are in contact while they're in jail they're going to deal with the correction officers while they're there why do we want to make them is angry and his dad and his violent or as possible by treating them less than a human being OK Patricia\nI'm I visited one prison um and it was one where people come when they're close to getting out and I was impressed um that was definitely a place where there are definitely classes I was training for jobs and a woman running the president was able to walk around that prison\nA beautiful suit in her high heels and talk to the prisoners in the grounds and they would answer her questions and our questions\nAnd I can tell some really good work was being down there with a lot of good people\nAnd I think the key to that as is training them for a future job because if you let them out of prison that's great that's a start but they need to have a job and we need to reintegrate them with work that has a real and that pays them a living wage so they can have some dignity back\nAnd I I think um when you're dealing with kids so we had\nWith say the younger people their brain hasn't developed jet you have to be twenty five according to the doctors have judgment and to really understand how to behave in this world so I think until people are twenty five it's kind of helpless for them to do everything right and some lives are so tough we can hardly imagine it so\nI think our presence try 'em and sometimes they succeed\nAnd the key I think is to keep people from going in who shouldn't go in and the first place\nAnd um [noise] you do they'll have to protect society I mean that's just a flat out reality sometimes the president is just as punishment and as protection now the next thing if we can figure out how to make them better people so they can get out and survive and thrive gray not all people are going to be able to do that\nWith just one final word on that of an you know there are some crimes that people commit that are so bad\nAnd it's very deep in the race of people to want punishment to be imposed a person and and that's something that has to be reconciled but there are some crimes that people commit that are so bad\nPeople want to know need to know the person who's being punished and that's why sometimes there's a push back on on some of the programs that are in prison but we are talking about internal crimes that were a person's actually do twenty five thirty forty fifty years in jail and I'm an ... very well it was appropriate for the crime that they committed\nWith fake are only breaking the let's get your some emails and phone calls we have a lot of listeners who are deeply appreciative of the candidates for being here and having this opportunity to hear from\nSome of the candidates on the ballot for judge ... positions because American voters routinely say that is where they feel most in the dark and here's Kate in pitch for writing saying I don't vote for any judges I feel totally unqualified to do so when my dad was alive I followed his advice as he was an attorney and was familiar with the candidates\nPerhaps the members of the bar should choose judges and that's from Kate in Pittsburgh we'll talk about that in our second if are there some other proposals that are out there or maybe ways to sort of keep the system but amended in ways that um maybe take even more of the political filling up but our our guest in Studio\nInclude judge Chris ... who is Monroe County court judge elected in twenty Thirteen and appointed acting Supreme Court justice in twenty sixteen running for position on the state Supreme Court seven judicial district\nAnd Patricia gal her was a Monroe County family court judge for ten years in for three of those years was also an acting Supreme Court justice for New York's seven judicial district Vicki are gentle judge or John too\nIs dealing with a continuing trial today that came up I had intended to be here and we appreciate that was unfortunately in the last minute not able to do that but I encourage you to look up as much as you can and learning about judge or gentle same with judge ... who was ... to join us\nBut is ill and had to decline just this morning so a judge ... good wishes to your health and uh so listeners again there's for candidates to positions a great chance to hear them directly so let's go ahead and get that only break of the hour and we'll come back to your questions for them next\n\nComing up in our second hour the story of adoption and the story of the orphan train\nStory many Americans haven't heard about will bring it to your next down with a conversation about the current state of adoption as well you probably know someone who's been interested in adoption what is the process like for parents what's the emotional impact on she'll talk for all of that in the system [noise]\n\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from the high falls women's film festival working to change the landscape for women in film with features shorts workshops and talks with filmmakers at the little theater November first through the fifth passes and tickets available at high false film festival dot com\nWelcome back to connections I'm Evan Dusten I mentioned Jim sugar man who wrote a book about the history of the selection and the election of lawyers\nIn this country and he had an idea for perhaps how to changes uh merits system for nominating judges he writes for Daily Beast on this quote\nMerit commissions generally are composed of leaders of the state bar representatives of the legislature appointees by the governor and often achieved judge or retired judge they select three names from which the governor nominate one pending state Senate confirmation after a few years on the bench\nThey face a yes or no retention election the system is also not perfect doesn't you'll always the most ... candidates for the most diverse slate of candidates but it tends to weed out the cronyism the ideologues\nFrom this kind of a process so that's one idea from Jeff sugar and Kate in Pittsburgh says what about members of the bar should they be choosing the judges are Patricia do you think one of these systems is better than what we have here\nI suspect as a way to improve our system but I'm not sure that anything other than just letting the voters voters better um the by association locally aside real hard to help give voters and put that they have not felt they've done is I've ... I've stopped doing it\nI don't know that they'd want the power to just choose judges I don't know how you can take politics out of it as the reality I don't think you can you might be able to simplify the politics and um by taking a by having a system where\nYou can only ran on one line the Democrats are and they're Democrats or Republicans around there by public ends if you're a conservative party person they'll have their party person\nAnd that might be a way to take some politics out of it because I think the the most\nAnd most significant politics of the whole thing that people don't say is that the individual little parties crossing Doris Becker party people and that kind of decision is made by just one or two people often and that can swing tens of thousands of votes so\nI guess I'd like ah that's something I'd like to say can set it as something that might go away but I don't know how do you ever take politics out of it because people have\nTheir politics and then when you say election\nJust by definition means ...\nOkay judge shut you yeah I'm I'm asked on the campaign trail a drudge don't you think we should have an appointment process ... less political and I say if you've watched the Kavanaugh hearings how could you possibly say that\nThe the appointment of a Supreme Court justice isn't political of course it's political\nOr do we do use that merits board that you've talked about in naming a judge to the New York state court of appeals to the off they offer up three or four names and the governor picks on those names so it takes politics out of that system a great deal but it it would be inconceivable or or just too difficult logistically to do that for every judge ship\nIn New York state so we're we're back to the election process and it probably isn't perfect but it's not a bad\nSystem in my opinion and I'm as I said it's an opportunity to get out and connect with people and I think people want to know that they're connected with the judges in terms of being able to know who to vote for\nFacebook is is fantastic tool that if you go on Facebook for for me anyway or you'll find out a lot about me you find out a lot about what my interests are well my background is a cases I've handled um\nAnd uh that's available to anybody on the Internet so Facebook is this tool that really has democratized the process of picking judges it's it I Can't emphasize enough\nOkay now you you did mention before we come to Tim and Bonnie on the phone that you did mention judge Kavanaugh and the politicization of of that kind of a process\nAnd it's got rice resting says evidence the single issue voter I'm disappointed in your failing to ask the judge is the most important question do they like beer I understand what you're saying and scar and I understand that in some ways\nIt it became a bit of a punch line it's not necessarily healthy then the Supreme Court the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process becomes a bit of the punch line I became very contentious and a judge chapter you brought it up as as politicized was it two political and did you were you disappointed in any of that\nSort of veering off into what areas that we I'm really not it's not that our leaders are desperate to hear you on a so let's let's put a cap on this quickly [laughter] do you think it was too political\nUm\nI think it it probably did get a little political um typically\nLook look typically the Supreme Court nominations do reflect the ideology of the party that's doing the nominating I'm so judge judge Ginsburg and and just sort of merge and be more liberal than I'm ... and George Thomas who were appointed by by a Ronald Reagan and George Bush\nCivil bars concerned that there are too many who lack meaningful civil\nExperience yes or no well I Love that question because and I'm sure a Patricia Gaylor loves that question too because each of us have extensive civil experience yes in criminal\nCourt county court my my experience has been criminal uh but I've also been acting Supreme the last three years doing civil and in private practice for twenty seven years\nI had an extensive civil practice in addition my criminal practice I've handled cases ranging from a motor vehicle elections to commercial transactions and\nAnd environmental I'm a waste issues and everything else in between in each of the county so that certainly doesn't apply to me and it certainly doesn't apply to um my ...\nOkay oh right yeah my my experience is mostly civil I did three years of judge Galloway doing just criminal a button mostly several experience but I understand the concern is the premise of this question available there than it is very you know about him\nIs okay um and again I certainly wish all four candidates for the two judicial positions here for the seventh district to\nThe state Supreme Court we're here judge teddy I'm a drug charge into could not be here for this discussion is our both had to cancel for very valid reasons individually this morning um but um but I appreciate that question and let me get Bonnie in Rochester on the phone next go ahead bunny\n... hello I'm actually this is a concern not\nThe level of of course the personnel were talking about now but it also involves the locals are situations involving primarily civil issues\nUm number one is that I think by and the Hetherington at the end for justice\n'cause a few years ago or ... or\nThe number of civil cases that actually were not able to get a lawyer for primarily because probably people don't have the money or the free system uh is is overloaded that's that's one of those things ... to before I say 'cause I Know what time is it that I really hope I'm\nJust program does another another episode on the judges and the at the civil level locally 'cause the other big pieces [noise] the um areas such as a a tenet landlord\nOr issues are very narrowly defined and um as you want to your guests are golden set a while ago about\nSomething else there's these drugs coursing other options which have proven to be effective because they broaden the discussion the many of these issues that I'm Talking about uh the most broaden they get is you know if you're going to be affected can you make up for my in the next two weeks ago but beyond that\nThese civil cases involve a lot of hardship and paid for people who are often low income and get caught and not not being able to really get\nThe kind of trial it kind of balance to people who own a lot of properties and landlords who frankly some are fine but not many of them are not fine may them suffer from\nThey kind of ... and I'm giving you a favor to have an apartment so I you can't criticize me the whole thing of retaliation all these issues which I Know we can't explore everyone now but I really would urge a series of of open discussions about these very\nVery important very painful issues that we are not addressing and my comments are based on experience and three years of being a social worker which I see these things\nAre continuing Hank bunny\nThank you I'm Patricia I'll start sure\nUm I really understand what you're talking about having been in family court I was lucky as a family court judge we were able to have\nAttorneys appointed for free virtually and everything in every aspect of of the case and that was a luxury oh my goodness oh it was wonderful I think what we need to probably come up with is another whole\nFree law from like the public defender the conflict defender legal aid another law firm to help some of the people that really can't get justice or at least not having a\nBelief that they're going to get justice because they can't have an attorney and then I Hope and those people get U.S attorneys that they will appreciate that these people are dedicated and doing hard good work because I every now and then I had those people\nIn court on I'm On real eternity you know and I'm going wait a minute you've got a public defender you've got a committed real attorney and\nWe're heading the under twenty seconds you agree with that [noise]\nI Would say the Monroe County does a fair amount in providing legal representations of people are limited means through vulture legal services programs with illegally society to the importance of this project and it was the ... project of previous judge\nTo judge

families would have to um they're required to go through in order to become an adoptive parents um I also want to take a couple of steps back um and share that\nOur focus that children awaiting parents um has always been a waiting children on older children um children with special needs children who have waited a long as and are considered harder to place\nUm children who um [noise] uh who may be part of sibling ... a sibling group that was the place together kids who are school age\nYou know it could be teenagers are minorities um ah kids with both emotional and physical disabilities so families who are interested in adapting um that healthy and sent\n'em or international adoption\nUm that's not an area that we specialize in we do have family who call us and we we direct them to the right organization but um I just want to ah make that a little clear for your listeners\nWho may be considering adoption and I'm considering us\nSo we do have that training that's available and that is required\nUm that the families take the training class and the training class like I said a moment ago is to help families identify their strengths and to educate them on the needs of the children\nUm we focus on issues such as loss\nUm attachment issues stuff like that and just to give them a better understanding and and equip them with the skills needed to help those children overcome and I'm overcome and possibly um you know uh uh well not possibly but overcome there in the\nShort run a couple of questions for we're kind of get into what Veronica delicious experiences which are are are they really ... illustrate exactly some of the benefits and some of the the great stories that can come from um do we know if I miss it again how many children in our area are waiting for forever homes do we know well\nMonroe County um has over four hundred children in foster care system currently um and and you know New York state um I Want to say\nWe have what is it about he teen thousand yeah yeah yeah and within the United states we have over a hundred thousand um children who are waiting for you know adapt to family so there's a large enough\nShe'll okay so ... hundreds right here in Monroe County alone and of course as our listeners across the finger lakes all the way down to Africa most of the way the Syracuse [noise]\nStretching into Canada but what's to buffalo you know to bid wide range as we're talking hundreds well into the thousands of of kids that you waiting for what they would call forever homes and when you talked about the training that involved helping families understand what would it would require [noise]\nUm I I don't mean this cavalierly I I'm I'm genuinely curious if that [noise]\nUm [noise] for some kind of reduces the amount of families are ready to have families to start that process and say whoa like I don't know that we were ready for this\nYes yes we do and some of the families realize that this is a bit much you know and that is not something that they can handle you know um and and that's okay\nThat you want them to realize before they are yes yes okay I'm In any idea what what percentage of most of the families we start to training do they go through with the full process\nUm a large percentage do you know uh we we have a couple who\nHave um said you know we think that we want to do the Ensign adoptions or we're going to try the international route so and it's understandable and it's okay because we need to know that ahead of time\nOr if you want to get in touch by the way ... throughout the hour if you're you're when you're hearing about the services in the work done by this particular organization children are what are your parents with the best way to get in touch\nFor a while we have our website and that is WWW children awaiting parents dot org or they can also call our office which is a five eight five to three to five one one zero will turn to Alicia ... who um I I I think\nYour experience should should really help a sea of central here and it goes back to um what what what are you kind of take me through your family's story and and how you ended up involved here\nI share about nine years ago um my husband and I wanted to start a family or didn't happen the biological away and we looked at all the different routes there are two adoption and the\nFoster adoption route seemed like a good fit for us um there's a hundred and eight thousand children in our country waiting for a family and all we wanted was a child so it was definitely a good fit for our family\nUm we met Veronica black and she was actually\nOur map trainer map is the name of the classes that you have to take to adopt from foster care for it to be a foster parent I'm so we took the ten week classes Los ... do you remember what that was like I Do [laughter]\nIt's intense um I I Will give it that it is an intense process it's\nIt's a lot of information um these children that are waiting for homes they've been through a lot in their life and you simply can't just adopt them thinking that everything's going to be perfect um you have to know their background and you have to understand that\nThey have to overcome a lot that they've gone through in life\nUm and so you know there there were definitely some of the training classes where you left\nWith feeling disheartened and realizing all that these children have gone through but for my husband Josh and myself at just lit a fire under us that we can definitely help these children um they need parents who are supportive and willing to walk them through everything they've been through\nHeal from that and move on\nOkay and so again it was what did you say ten weeks and weeks had to wait for them in that and then what happens\nSo from that point you get a home study done um they come the eight children waiting parents will come to your home\nAnd basically go through your home make sure that everything is safe to make sure that everything's up to code that it's unacceptable home that there are bad for children and that it's clean and\nI'm from there you have an approved home study this approved Tom study is what gets sent to the caseworker of potential adoptive children\nSo from there you can start sending your home study and I'm hopefully find your child and\nDid you feel any frustration with the process was always I mean was for lack of it was a pretty smooth for you [noise] for\nUs it was um [laughter] thanks to Veronica black it was food [laughter] um we did have some hiccups with some other case workers um in other agencies but children waiting parents has always\nBeen amazing to us I'm really really truly amazing people really good agency organization um have helped us through any rough patches have helped us advocate for our children have helped us advocate for our family and I just can't say enough good things about them\nAnd so now you've got a pretty bustling household yes [laughter] so can we talk ... hour how are your kids doing they\nAre wonderful and we started a almost nine years ago with just Alix entering our family Alex was five he was five and he was four or five when we adopted him yeah\nGovernor from the foster care system I'm so now that there's many kids will get to ... seconds yeah but you started with when you start with Alex yes I'm for families were thinking about this thing about this process\nWhere do you what do you remember you know maybe I'm 'cause this is not a newborn you're bringing home during a ... a book of turning five years old from foster care system and you've gone through training you thought about this course what you want but what was maybe the biggest anxiety or fear that you have that\nPoint I think\nThe biggest shocker for us was that he didn't trust us because here in our minds were these trustworthy supportive parents\nBut to him we were strangers and he didn't know if he could trust us or not we needed to prove that trust and the only way to do that it's time an overtime repeatedly proving your trust it's not something that's earned immediately\nWow that is that's a big powerful point because you're you're probably thinking\nWe'd been going through this process you know she had no idea how hard we been working on there's your your everything we won yeah and you want them to know all the coming in the door but of course he doesn't and of course you know some kids who go through the the the foster system\nUm may have many reasons not to trust right um so how does that relationship develop [noise]\nUm for us we did a lot of 'em\nType regression therapy type stuff um you know he was he was a big five year old but all he wanted was to be treated like a baby\nUm and so there's just some of that coddling and smuggling and racking that you have to do because that earns trust with children and always making sure you follow through on your word if you say\nWe're going to the pumpkin patch today and it doesn't happen you just totally erased any trust that he had built up and you you always have to follow through on your word while I'm or\nTimes is Alicia was describing the story of\nOf the growing daugherty family that she looked over at Brown and black and they shared a smile or Veronica started to kind of have a big broad smile 'cause obviously you have this relationship but also Veronica has her own experiences so what I Want to do is take early break of the hour and come back and we're going to talk to ... Turner who's going to tell us about\nYour family and and what you've experienced and we'll make sure again you understand not only is November national adoption months um but we're here because there's a lot of questions about how best to help kids need in our in our community there are hundreds of kids if not thousands right here in western New York\nWho are looking for what they would call forever homes and we're talking about that process the organization I'm is here to help you understand what they're all about what they're doing it's called children awaiting parents so let's get that only break in the hour and we'll come right back with them next\n\nI met a Dawson Thursday and the next connection parcel five gets removed\nIs this an opening for parking space green space or something else smear wars points to Kansas City and their power like this to learn about that and more we talked parcel five first our second hour pedaled takes a look at revitalizing\nRust belt cities how can we do it is a performing arts center on the river part of that is Arthur [noise]\nSupport for your public radio station comes from our members and from you our medicines highland hospital providing care to the Rochester community for one hundred and Thirty Years' highland offers a women's services total joined replacement geriatric care and other specialties learn more at highland hospital dot org\nAnd two points Capital Management uh Rochester based investment firm using a proprietary discipline to create portfolios of individual stocks and bonds to point Capital Management live a richer life to point capital dot com\nWelcome back to connections I'm Evan Dusten here is an email from\nDave who just says listening now all I have to say is what an ethical family what a beautiful story so I'm Alicia that's a that's from a listener named Dave\nAnd and yet they have you may want to ... ... beauty all the time sometimes it's pure comedy so Veronica selling me during the brain that everyone should be following Alicia what what are you telling and tell our listeners what you're told me during the break\nWell Alicia has a I'm a law that she writes and she also has a large following on Facebook\nShe is hilarious [laughter] okay and I think what makes 'em her successful at this as um that she she's not uptight there not uptight they they they they're very light hearted they're flexible there you know easy going so they don't take things personally they're not\nUm where some families may um may get upset or or feel like the world is coming to an end um you know based on a specific behavior where Alicia finds humor and everything you know so I\nLove the pitcher she shared for pre school of her son first day of school and you see\nHim on the um outside the front door on the mat laying face down [laughter]\n\nAnd she was trying to get a picture of him for um for you know schools every wants to take you know ... yeah yeah it's their first day of school pictures and and it was just hilarious um she has some stories\nThat you know it's you can't help but laugh at it and um and I think you know that's what makes her so great is the fact that she's not alarmed she's she's willing to see things but what it is but she's also um she's not\nA uptight she's she's she's like OK we'll get through this you know will work around this but she also finds the humor and stuff and\nYou know I I Love that about her she she is a major\nSolar should better tell us where we can find your on line\nI'm On Facebook you can find me and Alicia I met him daugherty or they'll let Brady Bunch and the the ... ... that was a name given to us by foster team that\nWe had at one point and you're like a lead Brady running right [laughter]\nOh that's good that's good I'm an ... Brady Bunch so so so they get for that David ... and now we've opened the door for you all to be following Alicia family story\nWhere apparently the one of the themes there's always room for one more who knows how big it will be the next time we talk to them [noise] um I I Want to turn back just dumb or a different email and much more serious points most name see tea\nAnd running how I Want to read this email and ask if you\nIf you agree with how C team views the system so here's the Ritz has no conversation about foster care and adoption should happen without the realization of what early childhood trauma is and then it can often result in ... and reactive attachment disorder\nThe foster system he writes does not want to potential adopted family to know the true background the foster children and the results are often tragic with many families torn apart you agree with them\nWell yes and no um now I Would have to say no when it comes to the foster care system you know not wanting um the families to um have that information or know how serious the needs are of the children because that is not\nTrue you know we don't want failed adoptions you know we we we don't and through that training we focus on attachment we focus on I'm I'm a trauma we focus on abuse sex abuse all those type of things we we we do that and for adoption what we do is\nOnce the families have been matched with a child we go through that child's filed with a fine tooth comb okay we question everything we read everything we go through it with the families and help to help them make an informed decision whether or not this is for them you know and\nUh so yes I'm a ... the beginning part of the email where the the trauma peaches yeah it's all down yes that Israel that Israel and um I Know my own children um [noise] ah suffer from the TST\nAnd other things but um we do want our families to be aware okay that is that is a fact we want them to be aware we want them to be educated we want them to have the skills needed to be able to parents children with special needs so um yeah that's the part that kind of\nI think something different that children are waiting parents does um\nOther different from other agencies is that they have a mentor program\nI'm so whereas myself and my husband we're currently parenting three children with reactive attachment disorder\nAnd Pete GST and it is not easy but what children when parents does for their families is that they match us with new families so that we can walk them through this process of how to parent these children effectively\nWhat does a reactive attachment disorder how ... how would you describe them\nSo this is where their needs were not met as a baby I'm just basic needs food cleanliness shelter um love and so from then on they have learned not to trust that they will get those things in life\nUm and it's like I said is something that they need to learn over time in their new family that they will have\nFood love shelter clean clothes warmth\nAnd as we've described here but I'm just going to go back to his pointer you didn't feel like you didn't get the full story on your kids when you were going through sounds to me like you are very aware of the challenge and the possible issues that may come up through the training through the conversations yeah\nYes um and this does go back to what agency or working with because not everybody as is as informed in the disorders that a child might have and what those might look like [noise]\nOkay so see defense for that though I mean I I certainly respect to the red viewpoint and that concern and it sounds to me like the organization that's at least with us today children her wedding parents doesn't want to as Veronica said doesn't want people to have end up with a filled adoption I mean nobody wants to sue I\nUm and can't speak for everybody involved with the entire process everywhere but this is an organization I think that\nClearly cares about that in and run for your own story I think sort of reflects that's what's uh [noise]\nWith cigarettes from the organization was talking about your personal story and when you take me back to your the process or that you undertook\nWell um [noise] I've been with children awaiting parents for\nTwenty years okay and\nBefore um I was employed there I knew nothing about foster care or adoption I knew nothing about it and only what I heard you know the miss the um the the stereotypes and you know that negative stigma that's on there but I didn't know the meat of it I didn't know the facts\nAnd I'm working there I learned about the children who were in care and their needs\nAnd how they enter into care because you know with that negative stigma so many families\nUm believe the children are in care because of something that they've done not realizing that children are not in care because of oh they're just bad kids they're in foster care because we fail them you know the system or as adults as parents you know\nThey're not there because of something they've done so that was something that I had to learn first\nAnd and once I learned that\nI decided you know that I was going to open up my home you know as a single mom I'm I talk to my son about it and I had to prepare him okay how old was he was four when I decided that I was going to that mhm and you know at that time um", "year":
