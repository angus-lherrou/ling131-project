in the program yesterday a lot of nodding from your own so I'll start with you\nUm yeah I mean I I think I'm I'm not an along these are things that I've heard 'em over the years I mean I spent a\nAbout six or seven years of my young adulthood I'm as the education coordinator over at the at the outlines on answering and hearing these very same concerns from folks um I think that um when it comes to a talking about the transgender community and accommodations as it were an equal access is really what it is um [noise]\nThe the issue of bathrooms in locker rooms come up continuously and they continue to come up and I think that it's it's almost um [noise] uh someone irresponsible to\nBe furthering these misconceptions and stereotypes about the transgender community in agreeing that yes of course I Would be concerned if my child was in the same bathroom or locker room as a transgender individual because that helps to equate the transgender community with\nSexual predators I'm with criminals with people who are are we only have the worst intentions in mind when in fact in states that do you have\nA equal access bathroom in the locker room a policies on the books there have never been any recorded instance of a transgender individual acting inappropriately in fact what actually happens is the transgender individuals are the most vulnerable and at risk for violence in those situations\nUm so I think that um I see where people come from when they're concerned about that because the larger narrative around the transgender community is that we are dangerous and if that's the only narrative you've ever been exposed to of course you would be rightly concerned\nBut I really think that folks need to dig in and learn more about the communities around them and see that the transgender community is this is just another community of people um\n[noise] so I I Would absolutely we bought 'em what center if like you said a around that but I also I also disagree with his uh assertion that because we have an executive order it's all done in dusted and we can all pack up and go home because we know the executive orders don't have\nIf your constructions true\nWhat do we do but\nHave to get parents to get better to better educate themselves so that can teach\nTheir children to be the open minded the day when I'm not I mean the first time I took my girls when they were little took pride parade\nAnd my daughter was like oh mommy those letters that so pretty and then I had the talk with her and I explained everything that's what they grew up with native now lodged in pride parades that's you know when you teach your children\nAnd it was too much negativity and too much narrow mindedness based not on sax ... spread it shouldn't it scared me\n[noise] okay well ... thank you for the phone call I Know and we wanted to weigh on some ... God in one of the things the the misconception\nIn the far right what have you believe that we are sexual predators but let me tell you a little secret from my personal experience because since I've started hormone replacement therapy I don't have a sexual Dr ... it's not there it's it's and it can't be turned on\nIt was before that's why Jerry Sandusky is much more of a danger and those type of figures than anybody in my community as a trans person that I read your own sexual drivers impacted by medication correct is that common Dr Greenberg\nYeah sorry I'm not Dr Greenberg but [laughter] and they are the kind of experience yes um it is a a it is very much the kind of I I'm ... tests testosterone is a really powerful drug\nAnd it is it is an overwhelming thing in the bodies of of children and there's very little attention being started to to to teach young men and boys how to handle this and I recognize that as soon as\nUm I had an architect of me so I just completely eliminate the problem a ... and I I realize all of a sudden that all of these\n... this underlying aggression that I had was was gone\nUm it did most certainly affected the the way I look at that having testosterone certainly are affected the way I looked at the world and very little work is being done with\nThat and Dr Greenberg ... when we talked about misconceptions that trans community faces to the extent that the idea the the stereotype of a transgender individual is someone who is\nUm either dangerous or overly sexual ... is an important to point out that and again transgender individuals it's a it's a wide range of experience and decision making transition or not\nUm you know sort of self expression in different ways and I want to acknowledge that but for those going in terms of the medication route does is important to understand that this idea of this overly sexual ... dangerous individual is actually medically probably less sexual is\nYeah I well it's it's just not what we're going for when I start right at people on hormones like they were not going for a ride rage right similarly we're not going for that sort of hyper sexual driver going for normal\nPhysiologic levels that will help your body do and it needs to do you feel Congress let your sense of self and then I also deal with younger people and parents will come back and say oh it's definitely a hormones and like well\nIt could be the hormones that could also be the teenage [laughter] and we have a lot of conversations about as penny pointed out\nKids and you have lots of things changing in their bodies and so when we add crossing their hormones that next for carefully selected patients with lots of other sort of safety around and and things in place\nWe talk about what sort of normal development and what's the hormones and I might phrases we're not going for my age if you tell me a ... going to check and see what's going on there I Am\nVery round well I also I I think it's impulse important to recognize that a large chunk of the transgender community um in their kind of cross hormone therapy are now taking testosterone higher levels than they were before so we're talking about transgender men are not buying their individuals who who wish to present as such um\nAnd so I think you know as important as it is to recognize what a an impact it has on a on a biological sense so much of it is also the way that were raised I'm In the way that we are supported by our families by our\nA social groups by our communities um you know just the simple act of introducing testosterone to the body does not make somebody a monster it doesn't make them aggressive it doesn't make them a sexual predator\nI mean that goes for sister under your voice and men as well it is so much around the accountability and the understanding of who you are as a person what your boundaries are who what your responsibility is to yourself and your own community so I think that that's a very very very key aspect of of how people um learn to um find their place in our world and in our community\nAnd that's that's you know that that I Would like to I don't want to make kind of walking back but to clarify I don't think that this is a semi what I'm saying is that there's very little discussion about the proper way to act as a man in the world and and then most of that is happening and then that's where the that's the stem moved me to\nA movement is coming from that\nIs this a reaction to that you know allowed wilderness in in in boys and men\nCan um I'm gonna get a phone call from Kevin in fair port next go ahead Kevin\n... of it I bet all of that just so please excuse me I'm a contractor for years I'm middle aged go living with my middle aged ... okay and as far as running contracts you know some of my best clients event gay couples alternative lifestyles transgender so I have no issue with them I don't care it's great to me\nIs just my feeling is all due respect that they have a bigger issue dealing with themselves and then my street itself has dealing with them I just wish there can be a point\nWhere you don't have to be in my face about what you are who you ought to be I don't care I just think you could deal better with yourselves\nWithout accusing me of being an Archie Bunker on me and as far as raising young boys and how to control their testosterone\nThat's ... sorry that boys are going to be voice in this world still needs met\nI'm Sorry ... got\nBigger issues raising sons and grants us into how they're going to emotionally handle you I I'm not going to have them pick a new or make fun or be literally you but once again that's your issue to deal with him to\nGet all the deals yourselves that's all it took a Kevin limited God Bless you all okay and and let me just ask you a quick question\nIf I could before you go here when you say when you say that you think they have more of an issue um you know with\nThemselves then maybe I'm ... yes oh okay so you do have a presidential administration may want to define them in terms of legal terms I'm as as as essentially are not really being real work this thing do you got to look at\nThe end of the day at the end of the day of and when you come all told them if you have a penis you're a boy end of story okay by now that that is their issue I don't care what they ... I don't care what they think or want to do or what I Want to be I don't care it's fine with me at the end of the day when you come out the womb you're you got a pianist boy\nAll right Kevin I I gotta jump in here I mean I I I take point that we've heard that for um\n[noise] so apart from the last part um [noise]\nLet me uh let me turn to Amy Amy with signaling during some Kevin ... comments there when Kevin and saying well the trans community has more of an issue with itself than the rest of the world does with the trans community unfortunately Kevin last kind of sort of trace that but but something that all that aside\n[noise] um\nLet me ask you about your experience because Amy I'm you know life has changed for you it's it's changing drastically and it will continue to and as a trans person out in the public space I see the side way looks I see this near you do I see\nI see the cross side glances most of the people and I can deal with that I can put up with that\nIt's the it's and I've been confronted by people in public you know already already what did I and it's just making fun of you you know giving you a hard hey sir and it's it's\nIt's embarrassing it's done to intimidate you and it's done to make you second guess yourself do they do they do it in a way that his laughing at you yeah okay it was done mocking\nAnd you know what and I appreciate Kevin you know at least he's honest in saying where he is and where he's at and he's you know what find Kevin\nI appreciate that you know what you're going to let me live my life\nI Want that same respect back from society and it's all that and really asking for you if you're religious conservative great you live your life but let me do the same thing but I see it in a lot of society the scariest thing to very religious conservatives\nIs happy well adjusted algae B. T. Q. community because we upset their whole definitions of what gender and family are\nAnd that's where\nThe animosity comes in because when we're well adjusted an operating within society we're not we're not the boogie person anymore [noise]\nI'm kind of ... and I and I'll\nI'll I'll echo what when he had to say Kevin I'm Glad you called it's important that we are all kinds of perspectives and they're all welcome here as we continue to try to understand what an God putting 'em\nA earlier this week I was actually on a pod cast with a Rochester Business Journal\nUh talking about this issue and one of the questions that was asked ... to me at the end was what can businesses due to ah help the transgender community and my immediate response was believe us\nThat's really all it comes down to is believe us when we say we are who we are\nAnd if we get past that if we get that at that legislation is is important and needs to be done because not enough people believe us\nYeah I mean I I think we're it's such a such a small subsection of an already fairly small percentage of folks um to to be honest I mean um\nKids explore and they express themselves differently um and I think that an index Greenberg and jumping if I'm if I'm wrong here but I think so much of um the um psychological and and the medical community is looking at it just giving these children\nIt's to explore what who they are um and when they come on that very country our understanding to give them that support and\nSo of course there maybe one or two every five years who decided actually this wasn't really for me thank you so much for the for the the space and and the the time to explore but the vast majority of of kids who are looking at like this consistent insistent persistent idea of themselves from like the time that they're able to formulate words\nYou got to be able to take them seriously and they have to be able to listen to those children whether that's coming from them at three or whether it's coming from them at seven just briefly Dr ... agree there\nI absolutely agree and it's important that people understand some aspect treatment particles again that's kind of beyond the scope of this this radio show but it it really is at its acknowledging where people are believing young people when they say who they are and how they feel about their gender and then giving them safety\nAnd with their families with themselves at school to explore and not every young person who expresses that cross gender identity and that's the term is going to be persistently incessantly and consistently transgender that it would be a fallacy to say that every young person he says that says you know inexorably headed towards\nAt long term transition but it's about giving them space and safety and believing that it's not believing young people and allowing them a safe way to with their families with their communities with health care providers figure out what the right and accept our\nLast gave me just a little bit more about your own experience because again as as you said when you are living as herself in public you you've already experienced some marking things like that I'm I'm Wondering if you're concerned about whether living as yourself will impact work that I think my biggest\nConcern is you know I can handle some mocking I can handle some insults and putting up with some stuff in the public space that's fine but you know having a family and having you know home and needs that need to be mad and bills like everybody else\nYou know if I ever got to the point of a full full time transition and that's my biggest concern is what happens to me in the workplace because I have a public facing type of job and so I Need to be able to still support my family I Need to be able to support myself\nAnd that's so interesting that my biggest fear about transition isn't the other party it's me being able to provide\nFor for my family my will be ... you know that's that's my big fear and ruin the law\nDoes or does not protect a nice job in terms of firing on the basis of her identity\nAnd that's the tricky part and that's where we get to the patchwork I'm so yes the executive order 'em in many ways does protect 'em it gives a more deference towards public employees so folks who worked for the state or or local governments um within the city Rochester we've had a ... an ordinance of protection since two thousand\nUm which is we were the first city in the state to put that in place and one of the first cities in the whole country to do that a ton of writing has passed\nA policy legislation as well\nUm but you know where we don't have this larger a larger law in place um you know if any were to be transferred to a job for example I'm In the north country or places in the southern tier even places in central New York um who don't have that very strong language within their city law within their their county legislation\nI'm oftentimes a private business owners are often uh a lot of little more leeway and when it comes to employment discrimination well as we get ready to close\nProgram let me just ask growing to let our audience know from your from your work is communications director of the alliance you've done so much educational work\nUm [noise] just there's this idea that well you know it's twenty Eighteen or they're really misconceptions about trans do do people really obviously yes or whether it's at the federal level was one of the legal level whether it's at legislatively whether it's\nA you know going out to the mall just to go shopping and bumped into people who are yes they're misconceptions but for people really of good faith we're still trying to have open mind to want to understand more and I think that's most of us\nHere urge them to call you can call you and and how do you learn more\nUm yeah I I think it's it's reaching out it's taking that big step to say I may not know everything about this that I thought I did\nOr maybe there is more for me to learn and I think all of us regardless of our identities can benefit from learning from other ... of or from other people um I Would absolutely encourage folks to get in touch with resource center is like the odd alliance I'm with ... or even with with truly um um\nBut also reaching out to their friends and neighbors their trans people in every single community and every single town every single neighborhood we exist places on we may you may not know that were there on but we are and so being very a very kind and respectful of that\nAnd learning more or less than we can get an alliance online where our livestock Oregon on Facebook thanks for being here so it's always nice to have you indicate Greenberg director of gender held services you our

film and watching it when I was for things like that to me that's all built around the fact that that is just a perfect movie for me no matter what okay All right so Halloween\nOr I'm going to go to Texas Chainsaw massacre ... that that\nFreaked me out for for years and it's just everything about it the the atmosphere of at the dread that that sticks with\nMe India and I think about when I'm Alone in a house in\nLike this is why I don't get we're gonna come back to the maggots [laughter]\nOh this is weird I mean I think that the the scariest like good movie\n[laughter] I feel like holiday movie as opposed no well that's just you know I'm going to explain what I mean I'm so I'm gonna say ...\nBecause that is an assault on the senses but in such a beautiful way that you can't look like you want to stop looking within the colors bring you back in and you can't quite figure out what's going on but you know it's bad yeah Dario jump on the ... the original not the new one that came out but um\nBut my argument sometimes they're selling as you're watching and um watch them going they went out in the woods with a camcorder and I'm hoping most of this is fake so that's a different kind of fear like I think someone actually got injured you know but that's that's not fun fear that's like oh God\n[laughter] so I like when like oh no I don't want us on the set and they got a crab service break everything's cool just harbors fine\n[laughter] okay Lisa I'm I'm going to choose a very old movie night of the living dead and black and white very low production values but one of the scariest movies I've ever watched and I can't watch that movie without another person in the room\nIs why then do you like it [laughter] I like it because it's incredibly suspenseful and you've got you already have a sense of my desire for suspense\nBut it's black and white and it has a quality that Meghan is talking about the Blair Witch project kind of low production value which I thought it was a pretty clever film it and that scared the crap out of the new but um night of the living dead is\nLooks very almost like the news footage for that you would watch from old well Walter Cronkite broadcasts if you're my age you know what that is\nI'm from the Nineteen sixties and for some reason the low production values and the use of suspense makes that movie terrifying\nEven though it's old and probably cost Fifteen thousand dollars to make right yeah I don't remember the budget that overloaded with very small budget yeah okay but you like the feeling of being scared\nUm I Do occasionally I crave that feeling occasionally so sometimes I I turn on the television or go to the movies and I say I really want to see a scary movie right now I'm In the mood for that\nI can I can explain like go out to restaurants you like what's the worst thing on the menu on five of those I don't crave thing that I don't get it like I can tell you this\nIs weird this is coming from somebody who when I was a kid I couldn't watch the thriller video and I had to leave the room\n[laughter] okay so I I was not a horror kid a but eventually a like a a switch flipped right\nAnd part of it I realized what it is is um it's it's it's a controlled fear like you can't think of anything else when the back of your brain is that like you can't be struck you can't ... you can't worry about what's happened in the next day can't worry about your job when for like an hour and a half\nOr two hours you know so you know you're just like\nYour your feral brain is activated like you're going through a fear and you come back you're like oh no I think it's cool I mean like tomorrow's gonna suck at at work or something by\nLike I'm here and it and it took your mind off a yeah I think it really rebuild to my brain like I find like if I'm stressed out or stuff's worrying me the world's wearing me like I sometimes I Can't watch anything else but like a horror film because it's so primal\nIt just goes right to it skips every other part of my brain and just like goes right to that back part of your lizard brain it's also\nIt's a catharsis you're expressing these interferes that you have maybe your stresses in your fears you have of life in general I mean it's it's\nIt's no I don't think you can the conclusions drawn between where we're at in terms of like war in in fragment in in our society in popular popularity for I mean the biggest um I was just reading a research on Halloween haunts\nYou know horror Hans things that people go to around this time of year to get scared they had their biggest year two thousand one\nRight after nine eleven people have this fear of society and you know all these fears built up they want to express them in some ways in horror movies are safe way to do that it's catharsis you're sitting there for Ninety minutes\nExpressing all these fears on screen where you're not going to get hurt it's like a roller coaster was going to say you're not going to get hurt I mean more than a more often than not you're not going to get hurt and roller coaster but you're going to go upside down you're going to take these twists and turns are going to be always G forces and you're going to walk away from it horror movies you're never going to get her from watching or movie ever\nBut the new Halloween is evil because they actually put the killer in a closet and the kids you know of course they're going to stereotype well that's that's going to screw up kids for a whole general as it should I mean that's the thing is that it's awful but that's the other things\nThat we saw a lot of us all these movies when we were much too young to really probably see them I saw me when I was four and it when you were four dollars for network premier Arlen I Try and want to Texas [laughter] right [laughter] right it's so you know I was told to go watch TV at a friend's house and I ... in that was on so\nYou know I watched it and it deeply affected me but it's become my favorite horror movie of all time because of that experience I had an ... most people I Know that are fans\nHave had that experience when they're young they saw evil dead when they were for because they were being babysat and they weren't supposed to see it it was all just forbidden fruit and they put themselves as experienced that they lived from the they they they got through okay so it's like hey I was able to get through the movie and it scared me\nBut I Want to see if I can do that again and you're testing yourself and your honestly I think it really has a lot to do is forming who you are in some ways I Louis oh let's talk about Texas Chainsaw massacre you said that that freak you out in your words for years yes\nHow is that good I think is exactly what has been touched on already you it it's it's a release like even like it's as making said like it's there's nothing else nearby and that's it's kind of becomes you want to get into a dark card night and literally checked the back seat I Do that sometimes it\nHas to do that I Do now face the guy wasn't going to training [laughter] enough horror films like I'm ready and by the way there's somebody in there what are you going to do I got ya well no I don't feel like you're just going to that I\nSort of check the ... and then open the door or a court like somebody else getting his cars and ... you like it yeah it looks like the the tickets are says that the release and sort of experience that and what scares you but in a controlled way I'm\nAll right so now now I Can't understand why you know like I Can't get inside your mind but I can intellectually understand because we're all very articulate in describing why you like that\nLizards if you want to talk about your favorite horror films like slasher films a ... thing or eight for four to nine five talk it's toll free aid for four to nine five eight to five five\nFour to six three to be ... if you're calling from Rochester to six thirty nine nine nine for let's say I'm a somewhat serious subject and I was talking to bend before the program began my understanding is new Halloween film is is kind of a feminist romp\nAnd my concern with with the friday the thirteenth series or things like that or you know have a very feminist you know it's sort of a ... ... women getting violence against women and really graphic ways particularly when women are engaging in drugs or sex and I'm not sure that that's a good thing to be\nCelebrating but does it either disappears me of that or tell me about the new film or how do you feel\nI mean I think that's true to a degree ... certainly for the slasher era of of Nineteen eighty to Nineteen eighty four what everyone's slasher movies were at their height and they were copying Halloween friday thirteenth and all those and they're definitely what we're tropes that were carried out in almost every film where\nYou know women maybe you were having pre marital sex and doing drugs and they got killed the irony to that though is that there was almost always a final girl who was strong and stood up to the the person who was a killer so it's interesting and I I Want to hear everybody else's takes on it too but\nI think you know there was definitely a lot of you know\nI don't know if it was a massage or whatever going on with those phones but the again the irony is that there was always a final woman that stood up to in killed the killer\nBut I my close friends who were really offended by that have and I\nHave felt that it was very politically incorrect actually I felt I was sort of moved by that program but that movie it to me is I Would not watch it I I remember watching when I was growing up I remember watching the TV version the serialized TV version which was pretty good\nUm and I read the book but I'm not going to watch film is it scary to see in the the TV version it's sort of a no no the recent movie of the recent movie\nThat yes I that the imagery of any ... is it good it's good I Do is sort of scary for me but it was good it was worth seeing I I actually connected more to the emotion of the story than the scares\nOddly that's like ... good at horror has he writes characters you care about your hair a fight yes every time you know actually in the shining everything oh my God like there's a windy and her child and they're just stuck in\nThe little boy who plays Danny who went on not to be at an ... a professional actor but his performance is just magnificent and they had to um because of the rules the Screen Actors guild rules they had to tell him that he wasn't in a horror movie\nAnd the shots had to be made and the sound stage in London because it would have been too traumatic for that child to have actually seen stuff that's in the movie it was only enough\nYeah so as an adult he saw the movie and he just was completely horrified\nIf it is any good I I loved the new film I loved the way they updated it um it's definitely different from a book which is fine um but I enjoyed it definitely creeps me out um I saw it a couple of times in the theater and\nI really I just enjoyed the the updated telling of it and I really did love the new\nAnyways I thought it was incredibly effective first of two movies right correct to the next one is September sixth next year the books like twelve hundred pages yeah it's pretty fast when people agree yeah well yes well for Thirteen hundred yeah somewhere of flown to he had no editor\nSo um [laughter] let's get our only break in the hour and we're going to come back with more your phone calls

break you know like a play the character you really like get freaked out by her know that to me I cannot watch horror film that I Want to do it I think I watched more films Halloween among them when I was too young for but two young disorder to get it and it just did not sit well\nWith me but um\nBut all of the guests are are at least the changing my mind slightly on certain issues because I'm an open minded person and I like saying I was wrong so they're doing a great job of that so far it doesn't matter to go watch these movies I'm not crazy so ... owner Frank rags where do people find your

... not\nAll right so here we are got twenty more minutes to convince me to go watch some of these films and we've got a lot of phone calls let me just ripped through as many as we can Tom and Rochester go ahead\n[laughter] thank you I'm One of my ah scariest from got us all my life when the original often the pill house which is made in Nineteen sixty three were the British girl\nAnd what really impressed me about it now that I'm an adult was a background was in black and white there was no blood and guts know minimal violence yeah that would butter which is really work on your mind and brought\nA member of the walls bending and and the noise isn't the statues and all all the stuff that really work on your mind instead of you know having the film scarier with special effects that don't always terrified me because it kind of made you think of what's going on suspension someone so forth\nAnd it looks to me is is one of the original great horror films that I don't think I ever get credit for helping how scary it was without any special effects the border I just like your comments on that it that anybody's seen as a Nineteen sixty three one\nWhite I'm Tom thanks God mega\nOh no no I I I've seen it but like I think that's the difference between wind to see go or not I don't think it's better or worse it's just a preference there isn't a gorgeous black and white scary haunted houses are great because that's where we most of us live so it's that that place where you live on it [laughter]\nOh sorry [laughter] you don't live in a haunted house oh no [laughter] no\nNo I mean the power goes out every other night I don't know why um there's there's nobody else on the street lots of ... but you need to start watching you still get\nReady to have a planet [laughter] get ready or we haven't mentioned psycho is does that hold up can knock\nHitchcock's movies many of them are classic classic horror film timeless so I agree with that I'm\nThe I'm calling about the ... the hill house ... story and surely Jackson actually lived in Rochester\nI'm the author of the legend of hell house um and also the author of the lottery another scary story but yeah I'm pretty Hitchcock the master of suspense and use editing very heavily in his films as in psycho the\nFamous shower scene in psycho has so many shots in it that I'm Seventy three something like Seventy three years you know I actually never actually see any violence went all the violence is conveyed through the sound and through the rap and action if the shots\nAnd that was with his TV crew he didn't he didn't think this is ... he thought oh man I was watching TV Now I don't want to put like ... like you know I think he just did vertigo\nSo he had a big full movie and he's like I don't know if it's going to work on the TV crew it was going to be a two part episode on health but Hitchcock presents any of the regional plant so let's hear what the kind of threw out some of the stuff that he knew it was like let me let me see if I can get these people to you know scares some people\nWow I didn't know I knew ... thing has something to do with some of the story boards although I think that's been contested but\nYeah I mean I could I could see I can talk myself into that [laughter] I'd want to hear something like that idea\nWell I got an email from Denise on the hill house so that's something I had a ... the Netflix series so I didn't I'm learning a lot this hour that I Will never use a rich in Rochester it's taken us to a film I Love this film concept and I don't think it's come up yet go
