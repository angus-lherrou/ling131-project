really nice it's a beautiful song um it's one of those songs that like everyone kind of knows and you're like\nWell everyone knows the song and then you're like oh that's ... it's incredible it's really I don't know it's really like one of the most optimistic modest mouse aren't you because I feel like when you listen to them a lot you're like kind of shooting yourself into a deep depression but\nWe split on it's like right like things are going to be okay\nYeah yeah I agree it's like they're they're like happy on the outside and then you listen to the lyrics more it and you're like oh no yeah yeah it's OK yeah\nWe're all going to split on um but yeah and then that will be on the the sound system just want to say again I Love them\nThat's it [laughter] um W where I did like an event or
