doesn't released\nA lot of music or in the last few decades Jim she's been very I'm\nSmart with the ... cording she's put out but I Would say each one of those is very carefully considered\nAnd is a small gym in its own right and I would put this record in that category that question how much is enough there's a lot of questions on this record\nWhere we live when they'd conquered the years when they break down the doors to easy street will they leave anything for you you know this is her apocalyptic yeah that is about you know we're on the precipice of an ecological disaster\nAnd uh she's going to uh\nYou know remind us of the fact that we're in a fragile place right now is the world are ruled on sticks so brave so small it's a key learning direct direct\nAnd at the same time you're going to manage it sounds really oppressive\nI mean it sounds like I'm being lectured do or what is this going to be\nBut the music she she approaches the music with a light touch 'em you know she's ... she's got a great group of musicians that love to work with her uh especially the drummer Jay Bell arose he's a credible drummer I think the Castro field he brings to his drumming to accompany the songs\nAnd she also plays with a small string section the section quartet in fact they're called uh they bring a real by to their parts it's not just bushy and soft\nAnd and that's very very nice\nA counterpoint to the way filter write songs you know you always get a hooker phrase or a little surprising there that sort of sticks with you\n... long after the songs done these are very very sharply edge songs there's not a wasted note on the record you know you you mentioned that she's a songwriter songwriter and I think once again she's made the case on this record\nI Know you're a super fan and and I am not in a particularly grouchy mood today I just want you know I I'm hugely disappointed by this record\nI usually just hugely disappointed I'm a huge fan Phillip span especially that nineties period of power pop effervescent or what she's doing here it seems to me wait to Tom Waits want to be in the sense\nOf a ... century cool now dabble in direct vile cabaret\nI Am now a dream\nOr not what I ate about Tom Waits I'm I disagree with you about the drumming I think it's it's way over the top\nIt's distracting the strings bug me are veering between this cabaret and this sort of any more Coney thing at times\nUm I just don't think the music is up to the lyrics which has always are excellent I Would have preferred to hear these songs in much more strip down fashion which is what she gave us on the none such records or in her pop mode there are two pop gyms tears in the ground\nAnd how much is enough and the rest of the album or I go in there with her\nI didn't

[noise]\nAnd then I went on to management I kind of circles around this for a long time in different directions and by the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came\nFrom a recommendation to ... that was the first film I ever did on my own you know I approached\nIt like this is what my artist once Jillian this is what he wants and I'm going to figure out a way to get on the [noise]\n\nYou know Susan your job essentially didn't exist for a long time and it was one of those things that sort of evolved as music and movies built to sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that or or Castro scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a placing songs from the pop music Rome or whatever genre into the movie to sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack album addicted to the swimmer\nYeah the swimmer though that the most beautiful Marvin handling the\nYou know in Spartacus in acting my record collection had almost equally soundtrack vinyl soundtrack visited bam you have always found that interesting and I you know never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was his job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into movies were record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always wanted the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people bit on the soundtrack after that\nAnd not kind of work it in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think where it's evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to San opinions I'm Greg ... he's gyms regardless and this week we're talking with music supervisor Susan Jacobs in two thousand Seventeen Jacobs when the first ever Emmy for music supervision for work on the HBO mini series big little lies directed by John Mark ... in that show in particular Jacobs a profiled a lot of you\nThere's many ways I think music's Rogers or the new challenge gouging the music world because they're introducing millions of people to relatively unknown artist I'm thinking of somebody like Michael ... whose song called little heart was essential to big little lies [noise]\n\nRacial thing it's all about whether the strongest popular not obviously ... has a certain cache Michael ... new or\nDoes not for mainstream audience certainly so are you kind of feeling like oh I don't care about judge shows which is what you're about\nWhat the song is saying and how it's going to work for this for this scene or this character or the show\nThe I'd always it's always what's going to convey the emotion that you want Michael ... was actually in big little lies and kind of fell apart so that was what was such an interesting discovering was that he was sort of in a scene already and Mel\nUpwards into that title but when you look at the power of what that has done for his career and ... ... bridges career just went right back up on the charts and then you've got something like ... so come down\nChain ... yeah yes\nAnd oh yeah\n...\nThe the\n\nAnd the acid with someone lights it's really exciting and I also think that's a power how ... music because it\nIt's a motion of it isn't just you know it's really he's a painter he's a Weaver\nYou know she uses little bits of in here and there are so you hear that so when I come down at the very beginning with them roller skating it's really cool but then it will keep coming around and around and and it it it beats as a people really feel like they have a relationship with that song by the time we get to the end of the series\nI think that's what to me makes a big difference about\nHow it is and it's and it's always puts conveying the emotion that the director wants to convey as you know I always tell people music as a point of view are chopped his supervisors is to make sure that everybody's understanding the different points of view that are possible\nAnd for someone like John market's really working backwards from where he's trying to go with the characters because he's\nThis is how he this is him you know I'm working with him at it more in the composer capacity and this is what we need to do here and we're going here and he's\nHe's very clear about the emotions of ... what he wants to do and there's no nothing is in their casually\nI Want to talk more about your work in movies you did the music for I Tanya that twenty Seventeen film but Craig ... be made about a Tonya Harding controversial figure skating\nAlways time yeah [noise]\nThere's no such thing as truth everyone has their own [noise]\nAnd he was still restricted by the time period but you have to pick music from\n... although I Tania ... nineties soundtrack almost entirely seventies hard rock why was that well I\nWas a film that I came in fairly late on and it was a film that had\nThat Craig ... had caught his film using a lot of sorts music and those songs are tend to be really expensive but also nobody wanted to be in that movie I have to tell you what are they\nSo when I walked in the door kind of more as like\nWere hemorrhaging over here and we don't know how to save this film and I was super busy and going oh my gosh and I looked at the movie and I thought it was really good the first thing I realized was that we have to change the narrative about what people think about Tonya Harding and to to do that and to you know try and\nFlip that around and so she had already known that he wanted to use a lot of seventies music which was a little odd because it really doesn't have anything to do with that period that time\nThat you know Tonya Harding didn't happen in the seventies so that I Would have formed her right\nWhen you say that but it's really for ... you know this goes down to the ... music and film was that when I said why all the seventies music and there was\nA lot of Matias already to American Hustle that was like wow that was already featured in American Hustle or this or that which I which I Love you know and\nAnd and taping a Russell does to you know he he said you know when you influence other directors it's amazing and she was like well I you know if there's something really emotional\nAnd warm about those rock songs and the seventies [noise]\nYou're my wife\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n\nWe met at an ice rink where I was\nWhen you sit down and try and jump in Asia and you're right you don't\nHave some more stuff that goes with the sound of it so it really started with Fisher such her first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher\nSo those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm\nAnd that she said that we could and have power because otherwise you wouldn't like car\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things and it was totally film didn't want it and it may turn holder so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed in I Want seventies music\nAnd then we just worked really really hard to get what we wanted and to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing is like Tania was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told\nAnd you know we mark ... was so gracious because he has turned down\nThe dire straits among Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out spent four hours writing the right letter and sent him the first real and said I'm just asking to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can send the rushed and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet so I'm [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\nPretty [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] anyway and that\nReally remote and it was really great but it was getting him and\nThen he wrote the sweetest note and said thank you Susan chickens I would've never knows that was it and he was so happy to be part of that film them so I think it's really about communication artist's artist you know we're ... turn to do why\nIt's important and why that music belongs there is a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O.
