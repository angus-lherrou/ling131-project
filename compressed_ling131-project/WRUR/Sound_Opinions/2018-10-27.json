song that I think typically ... this whole notion of the theater of imagination you talk about this a lot of movies where\nA guy like Alfred Hitchcock was terrific building suspense in building anticipation\nYou wouldn't show you what is happening but what might happen and planting the seeds of doubt in the viewer's mind about what is about to happen to these characters and I think this cure song subway song does that perfectly\nBasically only eight lines averse I great I'm In a baseline in this song\nWell make is that aren't you legs like queen and I went with that song because it used\nTo scare me when I was little when my mom would play it she has a faith that queen fan and that time is terrifying\nBut generally speaking queen is a pretty nice spam [noise] you know Freddie Mercury nice guy\nYeah that's that's how I felt listening to the song that I was younger [noise] it's kind of like friday is that you you know you're so angry\nI Do not like you know and you read my

song and you know right at the start they have that repeated single piano note and for me just that first seven seconds you could stop it right there and I'm already sorted out\n\n[noise]\n\nOh

Halloween special we've been hearing from some of our listeners about some of their scariest songs of all time and Gemini or going back and forth some of our selection and uh right now is gyms turn\nWanna throw another one to another dedicated listener who wrote in with a killer suggestion one was so good maybe go instantly Dole how come I never thought of it before\nShelby Peterson from Chicago said hard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cash to it and when she gets out near the end that alerted yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nEunice waymen need it smells real name is singing a song by ... wreck and Curt Vile from three pending opera\nIf I look at it as just the two that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part of her coming to rescue her the black ship on the horizon and the these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the desks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe weight Nina Simone plays it now she was a civil rights activists\nShe changes and very few words and does it skillfully\nIt's suddenly a southern hotel and that she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and the black ship suddenly becomes something else if it's going to become justice when societies equalized you're going to get yours\nYou know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed but that's what's creepy about it\nA powerful tune a scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone unsound opinions ...\nYou can watch women's grab a nice bourbon the laws while you're getting\nMaybe one student tempt me and it makes you feel well this is from Robin towns crummy old hotel but you'll never guess who you\nKnow\nYou ... you\n\nKnow one night they scream in the night and you wonder what that is\nBeing ... and you see me Ken green and ...\nWhat she got into green all\nHang out here yeah as is\n[noise]\nWhen the snow on it smack\nDead will be coming in\n[noise]\nUse human ... minutes flow as bad as what's wrong with you on TV yeah you're talking to me it seems to send them out in the hips but I'm happy\nFor tonight [noise] nobody's going to sleep you know\n[laughter] I think more than it connected with whatever they are already feeling like no love songs really expressed right but I was feeling and then that one dead [noise]\n... Oh thanks for having me [noise]\nOkay great we've got one final listener on the line Stacy is in garner North Carolina\nState year there yeah great tells about your favorite song for Halloween\nWell it's not a definitely a traditional Halloween sign it doesn't have a lot of traditional Halloween and but it deep red bell I make a case and he said in interviews that it sort of a reflection of how she felt growing up in Washington state while the Green River\nKiller whether it's um it's kinda murder song and that that kind of me\nMe\nMe\n[noise]\nShe does have that sinister streak under her but she didn't you just know she likes her movies in our novels and she likes scaring people yes and why this song in particular\nIs dizziness every voice the kids I mean he's not a big fan of hers but on the imagery in that fashion kind of in cages all five ... there's a line about hedge translate driver's side and there's a deep\nRed bell but the thing that really gets me is a line that says that's your health care without like an old paper bag and see what the early grades that just gives me the ... every time it's just such a great and it does you know\n[noise]\n\nYes the ... things beneath the surface of a beautiful song I grab stuff back safe to be ...\nI think if I had anything that was Nico case with a deep red bells a listeners pick or you ... you had a Greg I Know your your sugar in a bit over there it's time now for our final scary song we've got one more each Whitey guy\nJim I'm going to play one of Bruce Springsteen's creepy his songs state trooper from his Nebraska I'm Nineteen eighty two\nI think the brass stands alone in his catalogue as by far the bleakest album he ever recorded most people think of Springsteen is kind of this uplifting guy finds a way to find a little kernel of hope in almost any scenario if he thinks about\nYou know the born to run out and as a classic example of that he was talking about getting out of town there's this bleak existence that he's living but he's going to get out somehow in Nebraska the entire album bunch of characters who are kind of at the end of their rope I Can't find a way out\nSo we inside the mind of this guy who was driving along\nBegging the state trooper not to stop the only thing we know about this guy is that he's got no license no registration and what he says there's a clear conscience about the things he's done\nMaybe there's some contraband in the car some drugs and guns is there a body in the trunk you know what I think of that scene in the Coen brothers movie in Fargo will hold over by the state trooper and suddenly things go from the tension is in the air and and then things go horribly wrong\nThis is almost a set up for that scene in that movie that is a brief snippet\nOf a moment in the life of this character and he's about to snap in about two minutes and you can hear this little Yelp from Springsteen that becomes a war a few seconds later and you get the sense that yes he has finally turned the corner to just completely losing his mind and going off the deep end it's Bruce Springsteen state trooper unsound opinions\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nA\nGood ... book um ... the ...
