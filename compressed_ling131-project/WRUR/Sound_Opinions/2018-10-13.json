now it's time for another round of buried treasures Gregg is one of my favorite shows right indeed indeed what's buried treasure it this is a recording we define as something that's probably under the mainstream radar you probably haven't heard of is a a week collect these we try to do the show every once in a while and turn you on to great music\nThat deserves a wider audience Greg you get to go first journalists\nIt's an exploration of garage rock one of our favorite genre is going to ever since the sixties right every band that wanted to be you know we just talked about the Beatles were there was a lot of bands cropping up all over America that want it to be the Beatles playing music in garages\nAre in that tradition is carried on a long and glorious history in Chicago or the last decade we'd ... we've had a a ton of these really great garage rock combo in other words these are veterans from that seem that are forming as being eaters\nAre two things that make eaters stand out from the ... one is the songwriting bone Hampton in particular is writing a deeper more introspective lovely lyrical than you would expect from the typical garage rugby on\nThe uh the suicide of an older brother ah has really informed a number of the lyrics on this I mean it's impossible to miss a that vibe that melancholy tragic by that that courses through a number of these talks but it's not a donor at all this is a great band\nI I don't know if I'm explaining it right [noise] um you know I'm going to play a track called getting to it\nIt's got that uh you know hip hop ragged oh she oh thing but the humor and then also the sense of community I got seven words ... game but you know for president and mused for mayor bringing the city to completion touch the sky it had me reach and now I'm gripping on this cloud hope it will let me down\nUm I you know I think he's got a really from sense of hip hop history\nOr he is proud of his roots he said he wanted this record musically does sound like the tunes blaring from an old Cadillac driving around on the south side as well we're actually he wanted to talk about the press\nGetting to it by Matt use from nappy talk down to\nI think back\nMe I was bad but we\nNow\n\nWhy why like I got a name for president for me please be reaching out and let me down we\nMy\nI Can't wait I don't\n\nKnow do the wrong enough so you're right\nYou're

about him and he's turned me onto a lot of great music he's the music columnist at the Chicago Reader we want to share the buried treasure well we are welcome ... you've got some treasures for us I Do indeed thanks for having me All right man most pleasure to have your what what is the first treasure you're going to lay on us\nOr the first one is a group from St Louis called boxing there and an ... uh about five years ago you could see them play the first four bandit township\nExactly a a former\nFor those would be non Chicago which is about the size of a thumb tech and uh they have shown tremendous growth over the course of several ... this is their third album or nearby God came out\nA couple of months ago and it is just enormous uh I it it feels like the world opens whenever I hear it um and particularly the the title track um this is a song that uh\nThe co producer or Chris Walla of formerly of death cab for cutie uh apparently went to the mat for ... is what he told stereo gum the ban was going to cut it\nA an angel who did on the record not even put it on the record which is funny because it's a it's the title of the record [laughter] and uh I saw them play and Lincoln hall a couple of weeks ago which is a slightly larger space than township [noise]\nAnd ah they introduce a song as a this is for anyone who has worked on something creatively and felt like giving up and uh\nIt's it's so clearly put themselves out there and that they took real rich it sounds like a pop song it sounds like a pop song from the eighties it sounds like a pop song that is very much of this moment as well\nUm there's very little hint of of contemporary you mow up to thousands email in it out of the emotion revival yet or young yet ... yes or what I like to a group called the fourth wave you know [laughter] I Love it because they took such great risks and\nPulling off a song and I think I think it works tremendously Mrs boxing with near my God and sound opinion [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAlright boxing with mirror my God on sound opinions Lee or you know uh I Love you man that's why you're on the show I hate this traditional I hate this band I don't think it's a good idea to combine emo with news\n[laughter] yeah that that's going to came to my head actually was musing you two or something like that there have been other critics I deeply respect like yourself\nWho have been raving about this record and I feel like I'm the dumbest kid on the block is I don't get it I ... for probably similar reasons to have you done not at all it sounds like a really bloated arena rock record you you mentioned the eighties\nYeah this is like something I just hear in the in an arena and the eighties that's what I'm thinking and run for the exits so what am I what am I missing here to me\nBecause I've been watching this ban since the beginning the progression is part of what I find so appealing ... there were really shabby at first but clearly had\nA great ambition they ... they sounded like they want it to write for an orchestra\nAnd there's something about a few their ability to combine like Ninety the markets are says with huge production in in the case of the new album that uh is so compelling to me is uh unusual and unusual for the scene that that came out of to me it's a this record is symbolic of a ban it's\nAt the edge of something that could just break up tomorrow and are just studying just throw every idea\nOr maybe they could become a Twenty one pilot so either way\nIf you've got to pick a of an album that we really need to hear
