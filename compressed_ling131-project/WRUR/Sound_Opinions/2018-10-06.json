I'm going to regret is my partner is ... caught and our guest today is empty five sitar is Wayne Kramer\nFor ... years since he's here to talk about his new memoir is hard stuff do crime the MC five and my wife of impossibility I think first Greg we have to start with who was the MC five the motor city five\nRock band out of Detroit young musicians looking to make an incredible noise building on the music of the fifties taking in New directions with touches a free jazz and what would come to be called punk rock\nArriving at a time probably the most controversial year in American history up until recently Nineteen sixty eight\nThe wake of riots in major American cities including Detroit height of the Vietnam War the aftermath of the civil rights movement the Democratic national convention here in Chicago\nThe MC five never hit it big commercially as as was expected by many people until years later when generations of musicians have since\nTaken inspiration from their work punk rock in the seventies and you know the ... or the janitors in England Sex Pistols clash groups in the alternative ever like mud hunting your rage against the machine\nThere dozens and dozens of artists who have taken inspiration from what they did the emcee fought in Detroit in the sixties\nSo it's a fifty year anniversary general that debut album ... kick out the gyms was recorded fifty years ago this month that was a you know we talk about a calling card right it was chaotic very live you've got the sense of being at that Grande Ballroom watching this band at its peak\nThere was also a political veneer\nAs well that could not be discounted the the ... the ban was associated with the white panther movement their manager John Sinclair was noted radical and self described revolutionary he wrote the liner notes for for a kick out the jams\nAnd the emcee but happily went along much to their chagrin do or the establishment didn't like it so much\nI mean the big department store in Detroit Hudson's for example wouldn't carry it because of some of the outspokenness I mean the FBI investigated this bad ... the FBI file yeah so you know waiting Cramer talks about his days in the Detroit seen has struggled with drugs and alcohol addiction his time in prison\nIn his memoir and he also talks about his career as a solo artist and music composer for a film and TV\nNow Wayne is currently on tour celebrating fifty years of kick out the gyms and we'd like to welcome to sound opinions Wayne welcome to the show\nThanks guys have happy to be with you all are always happy to speak to you to\nWeigh in let's start at the beginning the MC five comes together around a cast of young mayor do well in the Detroit area Fred sonic Smith a guitar with you Michael Davis on base you on guitar and vocals Dennis Thompson on drums and the great Rob Steiner as the lead vocal is\nPart of what I loved about the MC five is that you guys were not polished specifically Rob Steiner he had these glasses this weird wild afro he was kind of a chubby your guy he didn't fit the mold of a rock star God like Robert Plant\nNo but he was the world's greatest rock front man yes 'cause he looked like nobody else he sounded like nobody else and he had a a vivid clear vision of the future of rock and and where he wanted to go with it I mean he wore glasses and he had a gap in his teeth and you know the\nThe big shoulders in this little tiny waste skinny legs and he wasn't like\nDirect from central casting that's for sure we worked hard to develop on an idea about what our band was trying to do and and what our message was and it was a message of self advocacy and self determination and that you could change the world if you\nDid it full measures you know if you've picked out the jams holy and completely you could make something happen [noise]\n\n\n\nYou know when a lot of fans in the late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical ... revolution as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War\nSpiro Agnew was vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new left says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that's this making some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar of the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they had against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before our court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretap case led to the downfall of Richard\nNixon I basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book you kind of openly admitting or you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I thought mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much\nBut the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation that just could not stomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know at my core I always saw myself as a patriot\nIn a democracy is participatory it's not just the word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it and I protested with everything that I had\nWelcome back sound opinions I'm Jim viewer got us my partner is great cash and today we're talking with musician and author of the new memoir the hard stuff Wayne Kramer\nBefore the break we reflected on how despite never becoming a household name the emcee finds radical lyrics and it's expressive onstage charisma inspired musicians in generations to come on going\nBut when the group called it quits in Nineteen Seventy two wings problems with drugs and alcohol had become a pretty intense in Nineteen Seventy five is called selling cocaine to a federal agent spent two years in prison for the crime is many years sober now\nIt took a long time and a lot of effort I wanted to know to what extent he blamed the crazy rock and roll scene and the atmosphere of that time for any of the challenges he went through personally with drugs and alcohol\nTo zero extent I I don't I don't blame the arts or for my lapses in rational thought to\nOr or principles that's defects of character that I developed on my own power saw you know I created most of the trouble in my own life\nAnd not all of it I I put a fair amount of it are right on the doorstep of the war on drugs or which caused me immense anguish over\nI live and still pains me to see that we have to point three million of our fellow citizens are in prison and in jail in this country [noise]\n\n\nObviously the policy ... stood on its head but he went to prison anyway and they will be five or ... and\nThere are several cocaine you went for over two years of Lexington federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky you know some people talk about\nHow miserable they were in prison and it's ... the sense I got to reading your telling of it in the hard stuff is that there were some good stuff that came out of there for you personally you know I don't know rehabilitation has the right word or but there was some learning going on you made good use of those years that you were in prison [noise] am I reading that correctly\nWhile humans are enormously resilient and able to find value and meaning and enjoyment in the most terrible circumstances\nAnd people in Brazil do right now as we speak they have the same fears and ambitions as we do out here and in fact we're all the same and um they made a serious mistake no doubt but um there are still just regular people\nAnd yeah I I was able to to use the time to improve my job skills took advantage of every program that they made available to me and I tried to understand\nWhat was wrong with me and what could I Do to make sure I never came back to these penitentiaries again\nMhm I mean obviously work do you never you didn't end up in prison again um\nWell it worked ... years right yeah I mean I don't believe president helps anybody number I think it may have saved my life because I was doing my worst drinking and drugging in those days and the people I was hanging out with were very dangerous people\nSo it's it's save me in that sense but these are dangerous places where you're never safe or you're embarrassed jury mask elated you are powerless and here in a world of the violence racism bitterness and defeat\nAnd nobody comes out ... better [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nTell us about ... you know ace organization\nYou in Philly brag or just idea can we bring music to these people behind bars ...\nWhat we do is pretty simple we find people that work in corrections that are willing to use music as a tool for rehabilitation\nToday our instruments are in over a hundred and twenty American jails and prisons\nWhat we do and besides just supplying instruments is we operate songwriting workshop programs which are self expression programs\nUm where we can help one learn how to express complex\nAnd uncomfortable feelings in a positive way ... you know everybody has a story and everyone's story needs to be told and it's the beginning of the hard work of positive change you know most people in prison they don't like being there [laughter]\nThey don't want to be in prison and uh if you give them the tools\nAnd the incentive they will make the changes they need to make sure they don't come back to these terrible sites\n[noise] started [noise]\nYou know it's\nInteresting because the politics and the arch in the music show there was a it was a huge melting pot of that in in Detroit and [noise] you know you think about back on that era it's just it's such a\nCollection of characters I mean between the MC five and what was happening and Motown which\nIs extraordinary but then you got you know the wonderful ... pop telling me or any any chance he got\nHow good the MC five were to him and his band\nThat couldn't get a leg up here was these guys who were made it or we're perceived to be making it giving a hand up to a ... a baby band that was trying to find his way you know he's become obviously ... I mean he's it'd be kind of care were you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers that danced with the band and and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances where I mean he's one of the great front men of all\nTime um uh so yeah of course if or when Danny Fields or does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five which he just seemed like the only\n... [noise]\nAll you know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise and we all smoked the same passion we always at the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nYou think about the characters you know coming through that scene again I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper the time but he wouldn't name just a little bit later I guess a a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all your characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't\nPrecisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we've all been together with all known each other going back to the record hop days where we're all\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and and uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between mall\nThe a Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time in Detroit was driving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible in\n[noise]\n\n\n\nOne of the oddest thing I found that you have a good buddy [noise] his name is Ted [noise]\nAnd I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place and the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah [laughter] you know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until\nI'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of arc and they were he was looking for something new to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Rochester", "day": "06"}
