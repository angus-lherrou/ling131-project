writes the popular ask a manager blog where you can write to her or to us with your thorny workplace or management issues next for weighing in here\nHi David thanks for having me we talked to some people before the last presidential election who had lost clients because\nPolitics came up and they did not see eye to eye and people fired them it's still going on we have a very polarized America give us some advice here I mean what do you do if politics comes up at the office and you're the person who don't want to talk about it\nYeah it really is okay to set boundaries if you don't want to talk politics at work you can be directed at that you can say you know we look at these issues pretty differently and I'd rather keep politics out of our work relationships and other people may actually be relieved that someone is setting that boundary\nBut the presumption or your answer is that it can be acceptable\nTo talk politics in some offices in certain situations\nIf everyone involved is consenting to the conversation that's fine I Would say you want to be aware of trapped bystanders you might not appreciate the conversation as well that's a good way to drive your

are very different from those people around them that people are assuming that they agree and they're drawing them into conversations sort of making them feel complicit envy points that they find

reactions\nI think it can be useful to to think about it from the other side of your coworker we're talking about a candidate all the time who you found frankly harmful or had a big sign in their
