yesterday leaders of some top us financial services companies are pulling out of a big conference that had been planned for Riyadh\nNow to us real estate not looking great which is an economic indicator in itself marketplaces senior economics contributor Chris Farrell is here this morning to you\nGood morning David what do we learn about the state of the economy when we see these housing numbers turn a little bit south let me just give you a couple of quick readings you know the Case Shiller index is is the main home\nPrice index has followed by Wall Street home prices are rising less than expected number existing home sales that's declined\nThe exchange traded fund that tracks home building industry it's down by almost twenty two percent this year so it's not that surprising that the mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac they came out and they predicted that home sales are going to decline this year\nAnd this is what our central bankers are engineering they're raising interest rates to tap the brakes on a little bit near the brakes coming\nRight we have mortgage rates are nearing five percent so to one extent you would say well okay this is the pause that that refreshes and the central bank is kind of raising these rates for the overall good of the economy but here's the question David and this is a question that's going around Wall Street a lot more these days\nWe have a strong economy and typically in a strong economy housing market stay strong so is this weakness in the housing market signaling something\nBigger about the overall economy and less about the fed raising interest rates\nOr can be signaling something about us we consumers of I mean many of us have debt and maybe we can take on more debt\nWe've been taking on a lot of auto loans we've been taking a lot of credit cards student loan debt is now one point five trillion dollars so that means student loans are now the second largest component of household debt after mortgages I mean that's really a striking figure\nSo that's one half of what I think this decline in home prices is telling us people got a lot of debt right now\nAll right so dead but what's the other half of the equation as you see it as well\nIt's slow income growth and I think what we're seeing in the housing market is that investors are recognizing that the gains in the housing market has simply out ran the income growth and\nInvestors are sort of saying I don't think it's going to change that much I think what this what's happening in the home market is telling us is that wages are going to stay low income growth is going to stay low they're going to improve but it's not going to be great that the signal from the housing market\nMarketplaces senior economics contributor Chris barrels in St Paul Chris
