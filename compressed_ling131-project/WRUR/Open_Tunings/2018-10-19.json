my last night in Rochester and her and I got together and um the since it was my last night we were going to spend the you know the evening together\nWe had dinner and um and I told him I said you know us some kind of wonderful some or write a song about you [laughter] so that's how the song came about [laughter] so when I left the next day\nAnd I was a driving with a band to ... to Philadelphia en route or she had pack a lunch and at at the age of sandwiches that took the bag and I started writing on the bag I don't need a whole lot of money\nAnd the reason I wrote that it was because at the time you know we were we didn't have a lot of money we were\nJust struggling musicians and I said I don't need a big fan car that was because the car that we were driving in\nYou could look through the fluency the highway [laughter] so that's how some kind of wants to shame about a lot of people think that uh especially when they hear the song and they say oh that's\nGrand flop railroad songs that song was seven years old when grand funk railroad record it and the way this all came about was\nIn the sixties as you know I'm Ninety nine point nine percent of all black music was played on black radio stations\nGrand funk railroad used to listen to a lot of black music and they played it in the clubs where they were playing in their manager approach them and said I'm you guys need to do a cup a version of this ... this is a great song\nAnd um so they went in the studio and they recorded it and it became an instant hit for them\nA prior to them recording it which a lot of people are not aware of another art is out of Philadelphia recorded some kind of wonderful his they called him the fantastic Johnny see I don't know if you remember the song boogie ... down Broadway\n... he was on a label called Philly of soul in Nineteen sixty nine he recorded then in Nineteen Seventy four grand funk railroad record law so today some kind of wonderful it has been recorded\nBy sixty seven different artists this pretty astounding and it is\nThe third most played song in the world it's been on the radio over six million\nTimes I have received I'm about thirty lifetime achievement award for that song wow that's great congratulations and what it was a lot of people would also amazing is that\nSome kind of wonderful is known throughout the u._s. or by grandfather railroad but in the in uh Europe and in the u._k.\nThe soul brothers six issues recognize for some got wonderful and you play a lot in Europe is I Do I actually I I was in um it totally in July of this year and I was also in Madrid I was in um the Canary Islands\nAnd or I'm leaving right after I finished here in Rochester I'm going to Amsterdam or Tuesday\nNo kidding so have you have you been playing in Europe since uh like the sixties or did you go there with the soul brothers six and\nA after the ... the original sober the six we broke up in Nineteen sixty seven due to management or during that time you had a lot of crooked managers as ... and so [noise] so [laughter]\nMaybe that's appliance [laughter] I Wish I should we should we should mention to [noise] we're just entered in dollars for our challenge had only ... dead we are in our pledge drive John Alison here [noise] with me and I'm Steve grills John playing on the plane tonight after a while the room\nI were also in our blood drive so we'll just mentioned the phone number and say that's a dollar for dollar challenge\nThe gallon for a gallon challenge from a wonderful\nListeners supporter volunteer you know who you are thank you so much eight hundred to two nine five nine nine nine for the number to call to make your pledge to take advantage of our good friends generosity and to support public radio sport different radio and a great stories here I'm an ...\nAn elephant so odd are corrupt management\nYes ah they call they were actually the reason the group um uh we we broke up or they were stealing our money uh\nAnd I was fortunate enough or in a lot of people ask me how did I retain\nA the publishing and all that and the song writing a I was fortunate enough uh in Nineteen sixty seven I met a gentleman in Philadelphia his name was Harold let's see is a he was an attorney\nAnd he also owned a publishing company and uh he heard about my writing and he said John you a great ride I Would like for you to become a writer with my company and uh he offered me a thousand dollars and at the time I hadn't even seen a hundred dollars\nA thousand dollars sounded great so he's he um said OK okay here's a contract signed a guy and I said\nHe should take it home let your lawyer look at the contract\nAnd that's what I don't need a lawyer I see you pay your paying the thousand dollars for it he goes no no I don't want you to do that is that I Want you to read this\nTake let you allow you to look at it and a while I don't have a lawyer he's he goes I don't want you to come back a few years later and say I took advantage of it and uh he after that he said well if you don't have a lawyer I'm going to explain something to you\nHe said if you signed with me he said I'm I'll make you a lot of money he said I'm I'm sure you had to protect yourself uh you know you'll never have to worry about in about taking advantage of you\nAnd so this man became like my godfather uh that's uh I signed with him or he is he's put my music all over the world\nMost people know know me for some kind of wonderful but\nUh I have I receive a\nRaunchy is from over three hundred songs mouth and or were they are ... ... all these songs covered by other artists as well I Know no not but\nA lot of my music has some of it's been covered by the art is a lot of it is just um\nBeen released some with

songs that been recorded after that boom boom boom bubble and the bass player\nWhose name was ... Benjamin he had a church right here in Rochester New York\nAnd he passed away I'm about ten years ago so I just want to\nYou know acknowledge that that people know that uh the soul brothers six really in coming from Rochester\nThat should be something that should be recognized here in the city that a group that has made such a mark\nIn the history in the history of music should be recognized here in Rochester which we haven't been [noise]\nI think you're absolutely correct we have to bring us up with the Rochester music ... well you know I did\nI N into for whatever reason\nThey would not acknowledge it\nI don't know why [laughter] I I Will come to her so I I think they were I think it's something that I and not just to pass on the back but I think it's something that would make Rochester proud to know that a group that\nMade such an impact on music it should be no here in Rochester that the soul brothers six is the reason some kind of wonderful and they're from here from right here in Rochester yeah yeah ...\nJohn Alison are gassed or Steve grills her eyes Steve hello and uh they're playing tonight after a while to room find out more about it a little theaters website a show starts at eight okay I'm going to finish it some kind of wonderful\nI got I had just a little idea there was a gentleman here in Rochester New York\nThat um he was a singer or ... or is there are all I don't know if you know early on that and that's why he was a gospel singer and he had a restaurant or won't Thurston road\nSo um I called him up and I told her I said earlier it's a ... let's do some wings was sell them\nSo he said okay so I brought this lifestyle we side salad and wings and there was this um skips meat market ... was right down the street from him so this is where we were buying the wings I Would go down [laughter] and so I'm the I'm butcher when I came down and get\nMade about three trips he said man you're buying a lot of wings I\nSee yeah so we're selling a lot of ways you say they must be pretty good I say yeah they are so he said well you bring me something back\nBut he was joking right so a couple of hours late I walked into excuse me Margaret would this I'm Trey wings\nAnd he looks at me so I you crazy [laughter] I didn't know what you say you wanted some wings and so he ... he tasted a few of them is a wild man is a good you see them or you got to let my boss tastes these\nUm I said sure he said well he's not here now you said how can you come back back tomorrow us yeah so I took a hotel and now the next day I came down to the skips meat market in 'em\nAnd went down to is the guy's name is Paul ...\nAnd I went down to see him and he said uh what's his I hear about you got some good wings as yeah they're pretty good is it will go up into my ... to give you what you need\nAnd he said and go ...
