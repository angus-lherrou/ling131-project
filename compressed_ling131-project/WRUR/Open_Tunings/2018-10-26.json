an economist in New York University's stern school of business the other day he got the news that he was one of two winners of the Nobel Prize in economics Dr rubber welcome to the program glad to be here\nI mean since you won the prize the other day I've been trying to catch up and read up on what you call conditional optimism trying to understand it better this isn't just rose colored glasses aw shucks technology progresses be patient a lot of this gets worked out\nCan you give me a sense of what the nature of the conditional optimism is\nIf you think about the fears people had a century ago about mechanization and the way this was gonna destroy jobs the complacent attitude would have been to say uh it'll all work itself out everybody will be fine that's that would have been the wrong attitude what we had was the sense of we've got to do the right thing and the twentieth century\nThere was a high school movement that said we've got to get everybody up to the level of high school education\nTo be able to do the new kinds of jobs that are that are coming so if conditional on doing the right thing in that case a big investment education everything turned out better for everybody but if you just our complacency it'll work itself out\nOr you're you're not going to be happy with the outcome\nYou know it's funny you should mention that historical example a crucial story we

this time around\nAbsolutely ... and there's a cautionary message here because people can look at the past and say hey you know the twenty century turned out fine so there's no problem it turned out fine because we did things to make sure it turned out fine and so there's no basis for complacency in the success record that we can see when we look back\nTheir new things we need to do in the labor market in education and didn't thinking about the future of energy sources as long as we do those things everything really can turned out fine\nNow many of our listeners will know that your dad Roy Romer was the governor of Colorado for more than a decade you probably think of it pretty good sense of how politicians chick but help me understand that you don't think that economists like yourself

people do something else that they're good at the net effect is better for everybody\nSo there's a process that involves a kind of political entrepreneurship where you know someone like my dad or any other politician builds coalitions they try to make a case for some kind of decision\nThat's something that that I could see he was very good at but I didn't want to compete with him because he was so good at it so I wanted to go off and do something else what we can do as economists and scientists more generally as say\nWe're not going to join the fight between the different sides that's got to play out but all sides will be better off if you start from an accurate sense of what's true and our job is to be the ones who can say here's what here's what we know and there's some things that you could try but you will likely are the ones who make the decision\nAnd before we go duck to remember at UC Berkeley when they win a Nobel Prize they get an assigned parking spot did NYU give you
