could discriminate against women job applicants a story we covered the other day\nA powerful trait and tech organization the Institute of electrical and electronics engineers they just come up with a new ethics certification process it's designed to help engineers make technology that on balance helps rather than hurts and his transparent about the assumptions built in\nJohn Havens is executive director of this artificial intelligence and robot ethics project thanks for joining us\nMy pleasure to be here this is about what a\nPutting human needs first when it comes to autonomous robots self driving technology\nOne thing in general it sort of an idea of a contract when you buy a piece of technology and the expectation is will be safe and all that but with autonomous and intelligence systems there's just new things that people have to understand are trustworthy\nSo for instance as engineers work on autonomous vehicles self driving cars and trucks they have to program in different preferences of self driving car has a choice of saving the occupants of the car in an impending crash but at the expense of killing pedestrians\nWould the certification program demand that we know about that particular choice\nThe logic is to write out all the potential scenarios that could happen but right now a lot of times those conversations happen outside the context of how many humans unfortunately are killed with cars is they are right now\nBut the way the technology answers that question is that something that the sort of a Geisha process wants to know more about or wants to the end user to know more about\nIn the sense I'll give you an example it's more of a cultural thing recently autonomous vehicles were tested in Australia\nAnd the lidar the technology that's used to sense surroundings hadn't been programmed to recognize kangaroos [laughter] so the big kind of like bouncing jumping around motions weren't recognized whereas like squirrel dirt emotions were recognized\nBut the point is is that you have to ask even more questions than you had before when you have these new types of technologies and then actually goes back to safety it's just a different type of safety question than some people may have asked before\nAs the technology advances it requires human beings to decide what are our values and what our values in different countries you have to ask you define them and be aware of them all\nEthics questions oftentimes especially in western media is coming from a Greek background of ethics whereas when we have the entire other side of the planet and the global south\nHas things called Confucian ethics or a boon to ethics and it's a reframing of the paradigm that's how we come to these questions and so it's when you ask those questions that much more this is where the word safety your trust can really be elevated to more global levels and that's what I Believe about consensus building globally\nIs to say we don't know we don't know yet but we have to ask\nJohn ... is one of the architects of the ethics certification program for autonomous and intelligence systems\nThe eye Tripoli John ... thank you my pleasure males who wrote a
