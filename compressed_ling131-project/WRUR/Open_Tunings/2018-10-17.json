R. U. R. W. I. T. H. just let them know will make a note of it all the hosts know\nAnd uh let us know where that money why that money was pledged so eight hundred to nine five\nNine nine nine four dollars or doubled and only until eleven o'clock so hurry up\nJess I I've been listening to a mark rubies mystery train since she was on the air a bunch of years ago yeah and I remember listening to it and started just sitting in my dining room table and having it on thinking why he's taken us in real interesting places on this show\nOr on such a great sense of curiosity and discovery a and each ... each week I listen to mark and you're taking those places every time the voices a he brings to the radio that you don't hear any where\nNo anywhere else and then you hear him talk about the other way to describe the show and promotion tucked but it really is a little Voyager ... and yet quite sure who is going to come on and off but in the end you realize you've made a a a journey that actually made sense you know what I mean it isn't just fragmented it's a terrific\nUm trick program yea\nWhich can only be done on public yeah because it's not we're not playing for to to get ears for advertisers\nAre not playing to the the lowest common denominator not that ah those stations don't play valuable music of course they do\nA but the ability to get outside of that little box that they are in and served just I get out of the box altogether and go and all sorts of directions as a a rare thing these days on\nOn the radio and it's only made possible because of times like this when we ask for your support\nAnd now it's a dollar for dollar challenge your dollars are twice as far as eight hundred to nine five nine nine nine four and I should mention too that\nUh maybe you only have a little bit to to put it in the tip jar just a couple of bucks here there whenever for as a one time a gift or those are double to die so you wherever you are able to\nAfford or twice as far and we get the numbers more so the number of people who called\nThe number of dollars that were pledged so and that's a that's a ... that's a valuable a statistic because it indicates how much of a\nA a desire there isn't ... our need for the style radio if if we don't get a lot of callers just like well you know we're not getting that many ... I don't think it's that and I think maybe is fading away or something like\nThat because we also not just colors 'cause a lot of people over new their membership we also measure the new colors people who've never pledged before\nWho play music are you are in W. R. th they do it because they love music you'll see them in concert just see them out in clubs you see them listening playing they yeah it's their fans of it first\nAnd I can tell you Scott what's high to they want you to enjoy as much as they do you know it's like anything else we talk about hockey and baseball earlier and we have it hard to believe that people don't love as much as we do is just going to look how how do you not love it you know let me give you more of at least show your white so good in this kind of we do here every day\nIf you don't like if you don't like baseball and you have to be in a room or baseball is on just turn the radio and\nIt's so watch their baseball game and listen to radio you doubt they love that yeah [laughter] and the average ... miles off [laughter]\nSo multitasking type of media I ... I was talking to fence you're talking one time vote 'em kit your son's watching baseball and you try to talk to them ... ... ... watching the game you know talking talking while watching the get go [noise]\n'cause ... racing turn the radio on yes and um\nAnd rationing for\nYour support right now or ... or a dollar for dollar challenge is just for about another twenty five minutes eight hundred tonight five nine nine nine for eight hundred to nine five nine nine nine for a dollar for dollar challenge twenty five more minutes ago this is Terry Hendricks [noise]\n\nYou\n\nTend to go [noise]\n[noise]\nOh just a game you know\n\n\n[noise] um [noise]\n\nAnd I ... for our fallen membership break John ... here with me\nYes in fact this morning I was driving in and the weather forecast here are like you know possible snow showers so [noise] yeah do you go\nThey're from her covers city in check a log wild love it from the tribute to Roger Miller called king of the roller to his version of England Swings great phrasing from Lyle Lovett their tusks Sean out\nAn streets of Baltimore with gram Parsons John plenty accurate me again a dollar for dollar challenge just for another four minutes eight hundred to nine five nine nine nine for\nFour minutes ah we've had a question the last guy I pledge on line will still be doubled and the answer is yes we time stamped those pledges so a few of 'em three and a half minutes now you're pledging on foreign same thing on line three and a half minutes um as soon as you start your pledge we start the clock and uh\nWe'll take your pledge fast you'd be in and out no time carry on today and knowing that your pledge to support his help move us forward in this really pretty short pledge drive five days were\nToo in the ... now and uh next week we will be here asking for your pledge to support so are\nThings you continue as normal do you get Scott without me which is the best way to have got\nAnd ah you'll know does make you place this week that uh you've done your part and it's a it's a great feeling we've talked about your number of times the first time I realized that this uh public broadcasting public media and public giving works um\nWhat drove us what makes us you know give consistently and if you'd never had before\nUh maybe this will be your story or listen one time the dog got doubled and I thought you know what I listen all the time I think I Want him you know be next member and we're looking for you right now uh for music that you love 'em it's important to you or your pledges port right now dollars doubled eight hundred to nine five nine nine nine for\n... three minutes ago or three minutes plenty of time eight hundred tonight five nine nine nine for the dollar for dollar challenge thinks they're Steve Sloan a member of the board of trustees say he put up his money to encourage you to join him as a\nContributing member of a different radio um we're talking about playing these songs and there's it's great to have a platform\nFor songs that barely had a platform manure around yeah I mean gram Parsons got played on college radio stations and\nUm maybe here and they're on and commercial ... or maybe when he was with the birds you got to be All right but I but he's a he's a he's a\nA you know I I a very strong historical figure in music and it's great to have a place where you can actually playing on radio and people aren't going to come and say\nWhat are you doing ... persons or attribute songs to our Roger Miller I mean yeah it's great to be able to do this and sort of explore the personalities of the music that we listen to and and how they influence each other and how they\nTake from ... in the past and writers from the past and keep it alive\nAnd then to create their own things for the future it's really amazing uh ability to be able to do that on a radio station where they let you and they only let us do this here all the DJ's because\nA membership support is a public space is not a corporate space the public space allows us the freedom\nTo do things out of curiosity instead of profit\nYeah and yeah that's what we're doing the ... challenge isn't necessarily us to get more money and even though it's always been doubled its to bring people off the sidelines into the game\nUh that's why you know these phones done it that's why all these challenges in effect to get new members people who maybe have passed and not come back encourage people to\nStep up and and be the next person to ah support public radio and WBAI or it's no different to all public radio stations we want people just want to be like Scott because we play is like me because once you get it and we know you're going to enjoy your key position to stay on the drive and so these ... challenges when it's about a minute left lesson that\nForce that we came in and eight hundred tonight five nine nine nine four and you're listening to eighty eight point five W are you are a famine HD Rochester and Ninety point won W.
