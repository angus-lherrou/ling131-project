pledged to train millions\nOf people for the jobs of the future tell me more about that and how it's going\nWe did we joined that effort and Republicans committed there to provide training and scale development to at least a million of our US associates over the next five years and that's going to be through education and training and you know it's really an extension of something we started back in two thousand Fifteen\nIf you're working you have to find the time to retrain and it sounds like you've been doing some thinking about this because you may have family commitments you may in fact

literacy gaps and three quarters of the people have numerous see gaps they're already in the workforce\nSo what we're trying to do is make it the norm not just at Walmart but across employers in general that people can learn on the job so we've come at it a couple of different ways one is through our own training programs and then what we've also done is a program that allows people to get access to four year degrees\nA dollar a day on their own time\nMisspoke often I have to ask you why is this Wal Mart's problem\nIt's in the interests of any business to address the challenges and opportunities that that have to do with the systems they rely on in our case our people are critical that's how we serve the customer our associates are the front line to the customer\nAnd it really

surprised 'cause we never had a big in your\nOr ever since I grew up in my mind sort of event like playing live uh in the studio It's MORNING shift tomorrow night along release a big would have to check that one of her videos yeah just great you are doing research for many years now so\nShe is she's a wonderful a performer great songwriter um that we're we're going to talk about the about your version of danger zone going from your album\nI'll just seeing it to a base what I'm worried that that idea come from and are you a person field founder or did so much to judge that song how does that come about\nSo so um I used to go see Ellen ... play in my hometown in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan she used to come to the local booze bar and do the six nights didn't and part of their deal with they had to come to the local gym and do a few tens to promote the night show\nSo I was a an avid patron of the local blues Saturday afternoon\nBlues jams I I used to go as a teen and uh and learn about blues and play blues and said I saw Ellen there and I thought I Would actually and I loved her music and didn't get to see a lot of female musicians coming through my hometown\nSo it was a real treat some nights I'd go to a bar would let me in the ... out the kitchen door if the cops come in which never happened but I sometimes go to the bars a Fifteen year old six nights a week to listen to Ellen play\nIn any way sister to Medellin a recorded\nThe I think in the eighties with an album that jak Bruce produced for her and um\nI uh started guitar at nine picked up base as a teen and bases my main instrument I eventually moved Ontario was invited to be the bass player in the Toronto blue society women's blues review we do an annual blue show every November So I think this is going to be the thirty second or third or something it's been on going on for a long time\nAnd we get women musicians from across Canada and Ellen although she's American\nLives in Canada so she was our guests I got to play bass for her on the danger zone tune and and they ended up doing in a few tours with her as well after getting to work with her on the blues review show and it was such a treat to get to back up one of my musical heroes\nAnd uh so sorry for a long story and making it longer but [laughter] I was at a folk festival and I was asked to be a part of a bass players workshop and I thought what the heck am I going to do and then I went\n[laughter] funny when I saw her\nUh do you have people often suggest to you that you are\nPeople send me stuff OK generally um and I'll listen and if it resonates in some sort of way then then I then I Will take it on but it takes it takes a while sometimes and sometimes it's not the right moment it might take me a while like\nThe new record there's a tune called ... that I download from my friend can't in early to thousands and I always like the demo with it but the records I had done just it didn't have a place on them and then when we were putting together the material for the new record it was like [noise]\nThat'll work on this one so yeah I'm just tuning up here 'cause I just because you care because I carry her and that sounds like a ... this morning\n[laughter] ... you have a a a few songs and like placement songs in a ... a couple of hockey related want to work and\nYeah I was saying that you were single ... well the last year my my jingle aired was twenty eleven okay in a few years but\nFor five years I don't know if you would have gotten the amateur down on this side because it was all through Canada as it always fish always to ... and I say that for five years so and I say and they say that if it and I still say that it shows in Canada and I mean aside from the little kids that I never knows it probably well they\nDo they freak out they laugh mechanical what went on in that class\nIt's it's such a part of our our culture up there the ... coffee and and all that so so it was ... it was fun to be the the voice of to mourn\nHer she was a hockey player but also the secret lives of hockey wives or something like that\nYeah I I had a son in that show and I ended up doing like a quick thirty seconds I'm van yet in there as a singer [laughter] it was really cool to actually be on a show and see what the protestors like I felt like I was in a\nA magical circus or something we got there the night before that we were shooting are seen and had to go do our wardrobe check and\nSo we've got came out of the hotel in end of this parking lot where they're all the trailers are set up and went inside and they check the word job and then\nAnd that was it for the night and then I went back up to my room and the next morning all the trailers regarding what they had moved to another lot or something but it's like downtown London, Ontario so well Susan that and I've had a couple of changing the TV show called heartland which\nI think is shot in western Canada I don't know if they're still area if they're still shooting at I should know about\nWas that the ... ... you were a character kind of it as a performer shot laws on the hockey one yeah yeah I was as myself and another is a new get to choose a song or they say we want you to sing the song I always from\nIt was a it was a a a fake soap commercial that we were singing a demo up but the the main actor actor in the film this woman\nWas wanting to be a singer in the show so she ended up being she was in between the two of us singers and we were all kind of working on it together for thirty seconds that with it and so [noise] but it was just it was really really cool and amazing to see how much work goes into thirty seconds of a TV show\nAnd um yeah and then we didn't end up shooting till the nighttime and the next day so it was\nSo we got there at five o'clock on say Thursday and then didn't shoot till friday at seven and it took an hour or two maybe to shoot or thirty seconds a crazy anyway that's how how it goes\nAnd the other one is a TV show I think [noise] or is that the idea of what heartland they place songs yes oh from seeing the obscene was placed in the ...\nI've seen one of them and it's just it's a cafe and I'm On the the music playing on the like the jukebox in the restaurant or something like that so and I think I think I've and I've had\nThere was another um movie I Can't remember the name of it dean Cain was in it it was in the nineties or something and there was a ballroom scene and one of my songs was background there too so it's nice\nAnd we just placed one in uh my friend I I don't know if you've gotten her record if it's come across your desk but there's a wonderful singer from Toronto named Samantha Martin and delta sugar three part harmonies very soulful and\nWe wrote a tune for her new
