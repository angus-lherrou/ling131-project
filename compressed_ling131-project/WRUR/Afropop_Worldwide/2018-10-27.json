California which they hold\nThat is a mother a band with four guitars and five dancers and that really kind of open my eyes to like what contemporary African music was and how much I Love it\nHave you back maybe\nThey're always pay me I was not an assignment\nAfrican in Congo says all my own earnings but gun I loved especially the traditional culture is still very rich there the highlights bans are kind of faded away a bit but there are still some high life are super cool and Cameron was a member of course and we could see\nThat was really hot in African music in like especially in Paris and elsewhere in the mid eighties\nBut really the mother lode was skin ... ... us it was the most musical city I've ever been in my life you go out at midnight to see your first band you wind up around the ...\nJust got a little up until dawn ... and so you might see two or three bands at night and every band had like a particular dance routines and uh my God the level of high male units and singing harmonies was extraordinary the level of guitar ship was extraordinary\nAnd and the rhythm section was fantastic to [noise]\n\nI kind of bumped into after interviewing him and this guy by the Franco who is grand a artist\nSinger composer bandleader legendary thing here\nI Am I I'm not I mean I went\nTo his house and uh his house is like a hundred ... beautiful furniture\nAnd his garage had like\nA luxury cars and I learned that you know Mercedes and all of us learned that he didn't he when when one of his impose your bands\nPosed a hit song he didn't pay him he gave them a car which is not bad to get a Mercedes ... hits on a and a bit of a control freak too oh yeah it was a so\nSo that the kind of a kind of seminal moment for me was\nThere I ... I was in this little dive bar you can also\nAnd this guy turns demands on my God it's Franco is wearing a survey and Frank was a big guy like three hundred pounds and a deep voice I'd interviewed him so he knew who I was I was an American journalists and he turned to me and said we ...\nWe know at least the Franklin James Brown Otis dean but you know Americans you know I'm a music\n\nAnd it was this like cry from the heart that just like pure my heart\nBecause he was right of course you know those phenomenal this is the best in Africa and why was it so little known in the world\nAnd that's more than ten years after the rumble in general when that was all supposed to be thrown open by that big festival that didn't happen so he was frustrated\nHe was very frustrated and he and he wasn't speaking about me not night 'cause obviously I was there and I was learning he was talking about me representing American citizen like oh you're right you're right it was really bad situation I'll I'll Try to do something about it\nI think something like that and that came through but\nBut anyway um and then the the the next time I went to Africa invited to banning to come with me as a co producer and we also went to ... you can just named the names of the stars at that moment where they're ...\nA four year old a media a taboo early I mean just so many are literally an artist\nAnd unfortunately you know because we have recordings you can actually listen to the artist yeah there's a lot of them are dead I'm uh anyways uh there's always new artist kind got so so we really were on a roll at that point actually we're ... we had gotten funding from\nThe corporation for public broadcasting so I came back from this trip in his life you could put together a little Thirteen part series and the big dog at CPB that and the radio program recommend\nRest in peace he said to me well San sternly the panel listen to your demo tape and we think that Thirteen programs is not enough we want fifty to\nGo I said well I'd have to go back several\nTimes to do the research to Africa doesn't do it\nJust you have an accountant no fun ones you have a computer no by what you know it's like you know basically gear up really quickly\nAnd yeah and then we're ... we're on we're new magic would never happen today [laughter] yeah yeah so you know an Indian in retrospect you know this is in the wake of Graceland you know God Bless Paul Simon and then we're kind of the right place at the right time and uh\nWe had the right concept you know and and and of course mostly the music are so powerful and unknown and that's the point of public broadcasting isn't it to introduce people to learn new things for their aesthetic enjoyment in for their spiritual consideration of\nThem are not might\n\nUsing it you can join and your trunk consideration to that is what we're doing here from up worldwide\nI always think back to excerpts from the ... to show off hard from an empty zoning which posed rose Mary ... book with Shawn Otto Banning Eyre\nThat's me George hey how are you I'm good I'm good at George I'm breaking for a parent leaping out of the pod cast dimension because I think\nListeners want to hear from you too about the birth of afro pop we've dug into your back story and other programs I Know but today we'd really like to hear your version of how you came to host this program how does that happen\nWe do okay time to reconnect with you now he's back in Nineteen Ninety we became afro pop worldwide and the point was to recognize that Africa is connected to the whole world\nSouth America the middle east the Caribbean that by now almost everywhere in the world\nAnd I would have to see that nobody has done more to enhance our coverage of the Caribbean and South America on our longtime producer also an author\nMusicians you can play a means to our\nOwn around ... ... where I specially indebted to net for producing over ... programs on Cuban music\nYou can find those on Africa bumped up bargain search on the human connection and now in next owner a track from Nineteen Ninety three combination Cuban gold released on his own record label Cuba these theories and it has to be out of the\n\n\n\nMain the main the\nMain one\n...\nYou\nAnd your own\nKnow\n\n\n\nI mean and and\nAnd and [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nMm the Cuban stone from as clean as the athletes\nCompany my company a captain of props Thirty years on public radio\nOne of the closest relationships that Sean banning them within the Johnny class white South African passionately information which room so deep into culture as a teenager to both music and dance\nHe later gains notoriety for combining the traditional didn't mean that the modern pop\nBand combined black and white sheep musician in the height of apartheid which was a brave active resistance his music is falling apart and you can hear the deeply rooted connection he had to African culture in\nThe next song is recording Sean and banning made if Johnny playing guitar and singing a traditional boots on in his home in Johannesburg in Nineteen eighty\n\n\n\nHe was sort of in a lot of ways like the voice of of freedom struggle apartheid in South Africa you as an important voice because he was white yeah and and he was willing to to take great risk to put himself in great danger to go and be with his little brothers to practice with his dance group when he was a teenager or whatever\nUm and has such off some stories about that yeah um but he's someone who like he is African buddies white you know like it's such a rare special combo that that allows 'em\nTo world to come together in a way that's actually like really beautiful because it's through culture through now he was important to me too because even before afro ... and and we we went to Africa when I was living in Eugene Oregon playing with my my uh reggae funk blues band a friend of mine\nFrom west ... who's a doctor had been doing some work in South Africa and she brought me an album of Johnny collects it was the scholarly selfish and uh\nAnd I became obsessed with it received particularly with the guitar playing but also that deep Zulu vocal stuff you know it was\nVery exciting to me but I didn't really know I had no idea where we were headed you know with with this journey you know but it but I really love that record it if it started me thinking about how loud cool music happening in Africa that we never hear you know and\nSo yeah he was very important early on yeah well and then you've got to meet him on the very first trip and after that and they are eight yep yep enjoy ... yeah and he was such a great storyteller and and he and he he taught me some of that to a guitar stuff that I actually still play\nAnd dancing is remarkable because there's this sort of certain style dancing where kick your [noise] your leg way high it's like how did you do that and you smash it then\nThey would know who they are like ... like I'm doing the splits but like bending forward with their like their trunks or whatever and then slow it down to the ground I guess like award adds\nAbout ... about ... about smashing the scale of your enemy ... that's a good way to finish off yeah there's always had to Johnny ... bands mates who as you say would go into townships where white and black\nBans were not suppose split with illegal illegal shows call and you got arrested how many countless times many ... step\nI grew up listening to Johnny click with my family because music was profoundly important and for a minute for me last October Sean banning and I went to see him perform at the became the New York city this was part of his ... or so it was a deeply moving and joyous but emotional experience well the thing is that\nJohn Johnny Was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a couple of years ago and he's now been through chemotherapy twice and basically is prospects are good but he was in remission and so he decided to do a world tour farewell tour it kind of\nMake the show that kind of summed up his life and you know I mean you've met so many artist so for years and sometimes they kind of remember you and they're friendly sometimes they don't remember you at all\nBut Johnny has always been really present you know he remembers right back to that first time we man and he's given us some just really spectacular very deep interviews over the years or so in this case he was singing one of the songs that he often ends the show with\nDella which is really a beautiful song it's kind of a song about longing and it has this great line that I think I Know why the dog house at the moon yeah and then he thinks this incredibly moving chorus and everyone singing along\nAnd then it has his refrain I burn for you and right when he hit it he spotted made the audience and he pointed right at me and and that I had a bird or you yeah and I was like oh my God that was\nThat was a powerful yeah yeah how did that hit you I was just really touched by it and then they send shivers down my spine I mean it really was a beautiful\nNo", "show_name": "Afropop Worldwide", "year": "2018", "city":
