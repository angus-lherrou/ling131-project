of my life for the past Twenty years my kids are Swedish American my family and I spend time in Sweden\nEvery year [noise] Fifteen Years ago I Lived and worked in Sweden and that was a middle school teacher and the school where I taught was introduced to me as an immigrant school\nAnd I became very quickly aware of dynamics around race and ethnicity in Sweden at the same time I was recently

want me to leave in Uganda or the water to kill me because of my um shelter works so I moved to ... that are being living here now almost\nForty years working as an actor and position\nSo here's a really important point people coming to Sweden and seeking refuge and asylum in Sweden did find those however the myth that many of them heard that sweet in was a place without race or that racism didn't exist in Sweden these folks came and discovered that that wasn't true\nOr yes most of the uh black people living in St ... experience and of course racism or you don't get as far as you can
