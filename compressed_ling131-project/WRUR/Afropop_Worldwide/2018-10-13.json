me by falls and yeah I mean a lot to do this now brings us to the sticky master of afro beat within the artists were hearing falls and yummy both to see the term afro beat as a way of paying tribute to stay alive how ever different the music\nI think mine Jerry and music the athlete down and I vote then even dogs ... the one who is like the Pan Am I supposed to be found itself I think were found a way to use that as a foundation and keep changing anything the way that\nIt's like I'll ask I just stick side so it's an evil than ever changing\nNow I think that's an afro beat the general term for every sort of music that comes out of Africa nowadays is the sound that we've been able to invent but I think it's a sound that is largely inspired by viola original afro beat\nWithout best now the original afro beat was obviously coined by the great set I could see the legend and you know she made his own south he was able to mix jazz and African precautions and now that sound that he created we've taken and we recreated\nYou know into something more than I think that's what it's called afro beach and right now is definitely catching up everywhere it's nationally just becoming something huge\n\nAs you might imagine not everyone is a fan of the term Applebee's to say the least\nAny kind of issues that we have to deal with this whole phenomena for being\nWith us from the end which is

where it becomes very worrisome let's not mix things up here for this kid's not being aware it's a term for everything I can but it's not out Jay you speak for popular music in the early on\nIn Kinshasa in when talk\nAll about it doesn't make sense but what is interesting to know time to stop ... before last that\nHe was actually calling that classical African music so it's interesting that people are jumping on that so that the originator I'd already moved beyond you know ages I pushed either way like I don't I don't do Applebee's anymore you know I Do plastic music you know from an applicant is like that you know\nAre they bond to leader of the band bunches monsters sound includes a strong shops and fill us afro beat [noise] here's what they lost son she has to say about the term attributes\nI feel the beat of lack of confidence in the way the media can be pushed to New Orleans this time in there and I think it should be brief just the pope arches\nOr you know for me being the most the most being music you have to let you out to Africa\nAnd they'd be like Germany and China and everybody's insurance ... you know so I think for beach within weeks we'll we'll give
