Steve Berlin Steve from Philly we only outside or the otherwise all Chicano banned his baritone sax from LA's the blaster joined last levels in the early eighties from Steve in a moment but first Cesar ... the only member of ... born in Mexico [noise]\nWell you know I I used to live in the desert\nFrom the time I was born to nine years old the only music I knew was when we come down your music which is the Mexican poker style recording [noise]\n\nThat's where I came from and then when I came to the U.S all of a sudden it was Nineteen sixty two was home right into rock and roll you know Chuck Berry and everything\nYou're saying [noise]\n\nI remember the first things I ever saw it at the theater were Elvis Presley movies going wow man who the hell is this guy you know and then of course I was there when the Beatles first came to America you know the Ed Sullivan show so I grew up with all of that then I got into like James Brown and read the all the R B stuff you know\nAnd I grew up also with the little transistor radios you know\nI grew up with all the cool stuff that ever happened in the history of rock and roll you know Beach Boys Beatles the Rolling Stones\nWhile I was looking back at just another band from east LA which I think David has referred to as the yellow album as opposed to the white album of the Beatles want us there you go but everything on that record\nIt do to us Diane bend your mix of a donation Jasmine ...\nMan you know it is then\n[noise]\nThen they started a little slow boys as that you know we were young rockers and we we decided to put together a band that was a dedicated to the Mexican folk music and the traditions Israeli against a grid that what's going on you know\nThat's a brave to my way up those crazy you know\nAnd then nine young one a\n\nDay and the guy in Maine man\nAnd he\nDid you feel then a political point of view and making the music and being out has lost loved ones [noise] well we always bumped out when we dropped the there was a need for us to bring back some of the culture that's the reason why we were doing [noise] we didn't get up and the lines and you know we didn't win the flags but we thought we could do with music and\nLet me ask you one other thing about this period um you're playing in restaurants and I noticed that you must have been plugging in here and there because I notice that some restaurants\nI got rid of you because he played too loud the first gig we did we were all traditional and stuff and then a few years went by and we got an offer to pay at another place and we were\nKinda you know we were getting a request from the audience who are being challenged day can you guys play the blues or a ... a stone song or whatever and we would do it we would play it on the acoustic guitars\n... people's minds because they did they like what the hell are these guys you know they just paid all this hard core traditional music Mexican music and now they're playing you know like a Holland will tune or something of beetles during a Rolling Stone tune you know the acoustic guitars and\nYou know kind of started sneaking in a small little fender amplifiers on stage and stuff and and that's how everything got started again you know the the rock and roll based on those levels and um\n[noise] and I guess we got fired because you started playing the Little Rock and roll\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nLet me ask you Steve I given that you would come from the east coast and we are not part of the original guys at Garfield east LA et cetera how did they welcome you into the band\nOddly enough there was a musical commonality jobs at a cultural thing couldn't be more different but you know for the first moment that we started talking about music and\nIt was almost as if we had lived in the same neighborhood are living in the same family for that matter 'cause it was almost all the same stuff you know I at that point it had ... knew nothing about the north Daniel traditions used was talking about the guy said well you know there's\nSex sports for the songs you want to come down and learn amongst yeah sure I'm started with that and then gradually are put on
