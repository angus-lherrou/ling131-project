Barbara ... is a professor at the University of Memphis and she specializes in cultural studies her latest book is called drones what I Do best hard country music and contemporary culture Barbour begins a new theory that part and explores the relationship\nBetween the blues and country music here she is Barbara change what\nWe're hearing country music legendary records and the truth or the truth than twelve bars were listening to American roots music that's grown out of a lot of shared territory particularly the American south well white southerners we're spare the experience of slavery and its aftermath\nThey played a lot of music with their African American neighbors to forward Bailey an African American her Monica player gave the grand old Opry its name on December tenth Nineteen twenty seven when he opened the show then called ws and barn dance with the Pan American blues\n[noise] [noise]\nI was surprised me most about myself and all this is kind of learning the business side of this and figuring out like\nLike being kind of attracted to that you know what I mean which is weird I don't think there's a lot of musician friends I have people that we've encountered business part they just go I don't I don't want to have anything to do with that yeah and um I don't it doesn't scare me in the same way\nLike music to me is this artistic form that we get to do and in music happens and then you've got to talk about the business part I'm not afraid to talk about this for because if you don't know your business\nOr something like a mess you up to me this is an artist and getting up there on stage writing songs is an art form but at the same time you got to talk about like what streaming doing or what's publishing and all the all those kinds of things and I feel like that's been a lot of fun I learned something new every day about this business and the interesting thing\nSo does Paul the entertainer what does he do to get inspired\nI don't want to give anybody a bad show yeah I don't ever want anybody that you don't care for this\nUh people or whatever however when people last like watch us to go man that phone it in the night you know 'cause I think people\nSpend the hard earned money that comes to show they need to see a show yeah not me just you know sitting in a chair on stage or whatever\nYou know so I think that kind of motivation to always like bringing\nYou guys are really good at engaging the audience to the point where they feel like they're in it together right there on this ride together\n[laughter] yeah I I think for me the ideas very communal\nAnd no matter where we come from a ... what you know you know socioeconomic or ethnicity or or sexuality all of those things we all kind of come together and you create this moment of like oh okay this can happen\nAnd I think that's the beauty amuse yeah you know what I mean it doesn't happen in a lot of places in our\nIn our in our society and I think music can do that and I think\nThat's important to me\nI still I mean I see it I see it you know when I went to go see France yeah he saw that you know what I mean and it's like this communal experience and it's like\nI I don't know I think that's important to me because it gives me face [laughter] you know and it is very church background\nOr you want to get to that tape that moment and everyone feels like they're having a shared experience and and I get to be the conduit that goes through that I think it's a beautiful thing and I don't think you can put that in the words exactly what it is\nAnother piece that often comes up is people with experience gospel music in the church they get out to make them feel good make them feel together and to give them hope for something bigger right\nI think that to me that's our that's that's the background I that's I grew up singing in church I just I feel like that's my ultimate goal I think a hundred percent that's it is to give that hope and I know it's a bit idealistic at times but it's like\nYou do all that you can and then when you come to a show you you hopefully you have that communal experience and\nAnd you do feel loved and then you have little hope and like All right man ... through and I think that's the power of music and that's the power of of and I don't know if we do that but I Know that I've had that in my life where I listen to records of songs or music and and it makes me it just makes me get\nThrough a hard time you know what I mean like the ... record like that and that's important to me\nMusically between you guys um Alabama Shakes what's going on in Birmingham\nA cheap rent actually [laughter] I think that's\nProbably a I'm coming from Alabama\nIt's hard to navigate because you know I'm a pretty liberal guy and so being in that state you kinda wanna be like no no no not everybody\nIs not everybody's Jeff Sessions how Roy Moore yeah [laughter] you\nKnow and and try to be a good ambassador and try to do the right thing and try to help those that that maybe don't have the same opportunities that you do\nHave you seen or for half the people who make comments to you with everything going on in the national conversation\nYou know I get asked especially overseas when Trump got elected it was just like I was just like we were in New York and it was just like there was a funeral goes crazy it's one of those things that you try\n\nI don't make it a secret how I feel about the things I and I don't think we should\nUm I also I'm not probably during the show them going on a twenty minute political rent\nYeah what's been bizarre is that when Trump was inaugurated we were in Europe and so we weren't we didn't we didn't get it and and we didn't get to see it and which I was really happy I was like oh\nCan still pretend it's not happening yeah it makes me sad and I keep trying to be like All right I'm going to I got to get through this and and figure out and this watch people's bags you know the good thing about being raised in Alabama and and believing different I mean I'm a very liberal God\nHe's you learn how to communicate with people\nBut I think when you start getting into prejudice and things like that that to me is not a political issue as a human issue\nYeah and I think that's where I start going no no no no he started talking about\nSomeone's ethnicity or there are the sexuality like why does politicized I don't know we need to have conversations when you talk about stuff and and I always want people to come from place to love ... I think the problem is that we're getting into this weird territory right now or it's like it's not coming from that\nAnd I use you read what like Dr King said any really talk about loving your enemy\nAnd I think people just kind of under estimate that state yeah do you know what I mean in trying to come from\nA place of love and acceptance\nHard I guess so angry and some man but I've been trying to navigate through that and I I think that's a good place to start\nYeah so for anyone who wants to find out more about the ban what's the best place for them to go\nI mean we've got a ... you know I don't know we have a Twitter and Facebook and you can't find it you don't know how to use Google\nWell we're going to go back with more music from Saint Paul broken bones that the mighty Mississippi music festival [noise]\n\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\n\nMm\n\nMm\n\nDo we do the ...\nWe\n\nWere ah\n[noise]\n... yeah\nAll those we never\n[noise] you just\n\n\nWell\n\n\n... [noise]\n\nBut you\n\n\nWell let\nMe [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beale Street Caravan", "city": "Rochester", "day": "06"}
