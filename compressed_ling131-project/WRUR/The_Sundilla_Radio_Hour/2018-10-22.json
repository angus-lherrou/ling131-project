with short of cash back to her album of two thousand for the album called apartments for love or\nThat's what I'll always be a little bit special for me because as we mentioned a little bit later on in our conversation shot I happen to be over dinner she got a copy of this CD like cats right backed by hotel really gave it a list that\nWas just knocked out by so here's the first phone call\n...

you why\nDo you ... ... ...\n\n... ... ... ...\nI remember I was just thinking about this yesterday I always had to be first like as the exam started at eight o'clock in the morning I had to be at eight o'clock because I could not handle the anxiety of waiting for my turn to come around\nSo I Do remember that being an issue and I I think it was I think the stage fright with an offshoot of anxiety in general\nAnd then when I started to get a handle on that ah between just figuring that out and and approaching any situation in life not just performances as not being a life or death or all or nothing situation which is a total part of anxiety\nUm that was part of it and then I think just playing more and more made it easier and easier and then when I started touring\nI think to her as a great answer to to learning how to just chill out and let things happen because you have to everything is insane when you're on tour nothing goes as planned you know you have to be ready to roll with whatever happens\nWhat really like to hear something if if if you're willing to play what would you like to to start\nWith sure I'll play one of the tracks that does appear on the new album is called never enough\nAnd it's really the story of a a mother and her son and I'm not a parent myself but I'm kind of fascinated by\nThe way that parents have to raise their children but at a certain point let them with their own lives and and sometimes that's hard to watch from the other side\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nNothing comes upon my mother's hard when boys and then she would know

conversation oh she's on a tour of the northeast\nOn tour for an artist like yourself and the kinds of artist that you and I do\nA together is a very different experience you know when you think to or we're not talking\nTo her bus we're not talking even the ... and three fifty which is like the the tour bus of the ... of the indie rock and roll set you know you pulled up in a rental car by even tell people that the in the folk world the cutter line three fifty of the folk world is the Subaru\n[laughter] everyone who has become like the the dominant folk music touring vehicle because it's so good and all kinds of weather and it can carry a lot of stuff so\nYou know when you're touring there's no real safety and a part of of while you were kind enough to stop here as you literally stopped here for the night just as a ... so you didn't have to make the dry from Syracuse all the way back to Toronto\nRight or sleep in my car which is what some people do the I've I've been able to to find very generous people who've given me places to stay\nAnd we are very fortunate that they did otherwise shot up by not have been able to stop by for this week's son Diller radio our actually that's a big things to Bob and Jill may for being guided up to put up shot a cast me and we're going to get back to more music was shot up more of this great conversation\nThe sun to radio hour continues please do stay too\n\nMom mom Richard Thompson is one of the obsolete heartbreak and he's still practices and I'm old coming from for\nMechanical skills you'll never believe what show to Richard ... reveal that and perform live music from his latest album\nMonday afternoon at two on W. are you are ... Rochester [noise]\nThis is the son Diller radio hour I'm Kelly Walker my guest on the program this week\nThe marvelous singer songwriter from Toronto Shawna cast be shorter was touring around the northeast a bit she played to date in Syracuse New York\nOr good friend Austin McCray another way between Syracuse and drawn to cut it off to stop off and joined us in Studio for some music and some conversation\nYou have to put up a little bit of everything when you're a tour do do like that I mean do you find have you have you found some joy in it or is it just kind of what you do in order to practice you are\nI think I just it just happened so gradually for me that\nI haven't had a chance to be afraid of it like I just I went from having a nine to five job where I had a steady paycheck and I was you know making me sick on the side\nAnd then going from that to to really making my living as a musician and as a touring musician because it's very rare these days that someone can make a living in in this kind of music without being on tour all the time\nAnd then to go from that to a really unstable lifestyle where you know being on the road not really knowing what's going to happen and and just having to take whatever comes I think it's just it was just a survival thing and if you just have to I just had to do it and now I've gotten used to it and that\nChaos seems normal to me now\nYou spend a lot of years studying you said yourself classical guitar classical voice\nYou know along the lines you store performing your own music that's a big jump from other people's music and literature you know ... classical literature to well I might as well be the person who wrote it as well when did you start writing your cells\nThat you're writing in high school like a lot of people do like bad teenage songs and died teenage poetry\nAnd I just started playing local shows in Ottawa an open Mike and stuff and\nAnd then when I moved to Toronto I started playing open makes in Toronto and then started meeting other musicians as going to a lot of shows I always recommend anyone who's starting out and music and wants to know how to how to get ahead is go see other people play\nAnd learn from them and I had him in Toronto there's a million shows a night that you could go see it any time\nSo I went to see a lot of stuff and I met a lot of other musicians took courses\nUm and just kept working when I was doing and I'm Still working what I'm doing and\nI think that some of the things that I I work at all the time are trying to access my most honest self as a writer and a performer because in classical music as you said you know you're doing someone else's material and you're interpreting it on your own\nBut it's not the same as trying to pull out something possibly really personal and and um and terrifying at times and you want to share that with people the the more raw an honest that is the better and so I'm constantly working on that\nAnd in the past few years I've been constantly working on trying to access my own real singing voice and it's just the folk voice and and my true voice I think is different than the classical voice that I ... for many years\nSometimes I help friends move who are a couple in a relationship\nAnd every time I Do it's fascinating to watch them interact with each other on moving day\nBecause I think that that is their most real raw moments in their relationship you really get to see who plays what role and who deals with stress better and it's just really nice to watch\nBut but cool because if two people are moving together they're also very much in love and planning a life together so why don't you write a love song for those people\n\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nWill sign of any ... drum\nMm no again\nHow do we know when it gets real that's a very ... ...\n...\nWill sign the moving van\nHad to the edges with as much as we can do anything we leave behind\nBuild again that for a living now [noise]\nMm Mm\nAny oh come on the you know\nWe don't show it\nWas set it up and we didn't go\n\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nWe'll start with the trailer go on the back window again given me a hard time\nMm me when I get off track\nAnd then the video trailer on that\n\n... will sign of in food down see\nBig long waiting on me\nGet out the kinks above me\nThat love in food down the\n... ...\n... and it'll come sit on the others\nNot we're\nGoing to show it\nStill was set it up right\nWe can go\n\nAnd we didn't know how we didn't know how\nWe can go Mm\nMm\nMm wheels but as you can [noise]\nWith your hand on my knees and your blood on the debt if we can get this low we can get out there\nThat I didn't know then ... ... ... and we all want a man\nLike that you want to know that we are ... well I don't know that that\n\nLove in a moving van is music from Sean I cast my guess this week\nOn the sun Diller radio hour just a beautiful song that appears on showing his latest album I certainly encourage you to

Diller radio hour continues please stay to\n[noise] do well by doing good become an underwriter to learn more about connecting your business with different radio audience is sending emails to underwriting W are you are not boring [noise]\nNa\nNa\n...\nThis is the son Diller radio hour I'm Kelly Walker but I guess this week is Shawna cast be let's get right back to our conversation when we know last year where were you in the process of recording this new album\nI had not yet gone into the studio but I had decided I had planned it out so I knew I was going to be recording and I knew that kind of out in that I wanted to make\nAnd I was just in probably in the protesters making demos for for my producer an engineer but I didn't start recording 'til a couple of months later\nMy my top line like my top impression of this old woman I think the thing that really knocked me a lovable affable thought it was terrific\nBut if I were to encapsulate why this one has really caught my year beyond the fact that I like your music and you said it to me\nWas this album is very produced without sounding produced it manages to capture the intimacy that immediacy of obscene you live you know I've only ever seen you live in a hotel room and conference\nYou know so I haven't seen you in an ideal but that there's something about that that environment that is very\nYou know somebody who showed the beds all up against the wall and they brought in some folding chairs and that's that's kind of fun and funky room to see you in\nThis album manages to be very clearly carefully crafted without sounding slick without so you know it didn't it didn't smooth off those those lovely\nWarm intimate personal as you would say truthful moments about the music ... have you worked with his producer before was this a lot of production from you\nThis is all the genius Don Kerr\nUm thank you Don [laughter] yes thank you Don for so many things I met done I met\nDown over the years he's a great drummer and he's played with bands like the static played with Ron ... so um and and he lives in Toronto and so I I had known him a little bit and then I knew he had a studio and I heard a recording that he had done for my friend any Campbell\nWho incidentally also does all of the graphic design for me that's on this record\nBut she's an amazing singer songwriter and she had made a record with Don and I was um [noise] maybe about six months before I met you that's when I was trying to figure out how I wanted to make this record I knew I wanted to make a new record I didn't know who to work with I knew that I wanted a full band sound but again I mentioned to still be really intimate and\nAn authentic and I was going on two were in the southeastern United States for the first time and that car did have a CD player [laughter]\nAnd um my friend Amy's record has this song where she has a line that says um Ohio bleeds into Kentucky and I specifically took that record with me because I wanted to hear that when I was driving from Ohio Kentucky\nAnd not just signing your trip yeah and that was the record she may be done and so I I put it into the CD player I'm driving around for hours and I'm listening to this record", "show_name": "The Sundilla Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "22"}
