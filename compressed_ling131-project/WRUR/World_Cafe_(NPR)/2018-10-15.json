I didn't have that much of a deal I Do but I felt that anxiety when I listened to the ... and because I was so close to ... ... you know steady and the value of my country\nI didn't want to listen to the second time because it was just who it was it was picked my son just turned my guts inside out and I'm not it's still with me in that same feeling comes after the election in November last year\nAnd I'm like something is wrong about or like we're all so how do we approach the how do we bring joy to people that are feeding lost\nIt it's a lot of things that comes to my mind when I decided to touch up on this and exactly because the ... the words the it was about ... and ... but it that ... not to um um [noise] it's not you know me you know you just\nThink ... ... you you have to go OK I Want to be some want to do something\nAnd for me that's why I wanted to do these ... cover all the oil out of them because some ... meaning for me\nActually keep Joe in Studio would listen

travelers maybe one car design really holiday strategy Johnny Cash and the next Monday water\nUm I didn't know the list at the time or in recent years that the talking heads based cultural appropriation issues would remain in light because they were influenced by say look who tea and afro beat and so people said they just took it and used it but yet you disagree with that\nAt ... okay because if you want to hear the the the the the afro beat they seem to mind is that we do the ... original uh we many light I mean the thing is we live in an era what it would have to be controversial and I think that\nBecause he's got to go see it is it is the new new rules of at least in the soup\nAnd it we don't have the truth it's real anymore but the most biting ... so I don't I don't believe in cultural appropriation\nGoes without probation for me I see a court will mention because somebody in spite of that you would you do your music you expanding what the president have done before ... it means to be talking about because of the appropriations no one gets the I've been in since the muddy water\nI Can't I mean you need a role model in everything we do\nBut they didn't take it literally from Santa ... you're listening to afro beat they didn't put it in their what they do was the loop of the draw on\nThe idea of looping something ... and ... and ... and and what if you listen to the talking heads is the best line that he knew that play ... at the same lines from the beginning to the end of the so they didn't do anything really from Fayetteville equity\nBut when that album was we need to get them to forget that the press release that said we have been in ... and we we we encourage you to live with this book in this book that'd be reading ... doing the

the girls go July appropriation run me doesn't exist\nFor me is stealing it could go to the appropriations Dick somebody's song mhm are you put your money\nOr yeah or there's a fine difference fine line between hearing the music of Fela Kuti and going I'm inspired by I Want to make something or just blatantly stealing something or not understanding your privilege things like that\nWe have to be

you go somewhere somebody treat you wrong\nYou have nothing to say because you've done that\nAnd I always say to people before you speak be mindful of people around you you can't just say things I think that it's OK mhm because if you say it's okay then somebody walk in front of you that you call your name's what you do\nIt's OK yeah but we just think that it's okay to just be aggression people find it funny when you do that means that you were miserable person yes and that you are not happy you are insecure and you have some issue with yourself to deal with it and leave a lot of your

we want to make sure we're just reach her shout away\nYour smart speaker to play different radio and you gotta live digital stream of our broadcast you can also ask your smart speaker about what's playing at the little theater as this technology continues to evolve\nPrint journalism what we do here at public broadcasting the journalist in our newsroom and our colleagues around the town and I hope that uh this week we're in the middle of the membership campaign and I hope everyone is thinking about what does it take to fund journalism what is my role here what's the value you know when sheriff says he's happy happy is around ... ... you're\nThere's something that that is positive about at least the community getting to see kind of behind the curtain because there's no way you'd ever allow in Georgia and max and we'll Morgan to be there you can't can't you can't guarantee their safety but the fact is there okay they were not injured\nAnd we got this opportunity there's value in at least seeing it more up close I guess\nYeah and being on the receiving some stories that I don't want to like him from journalism 'cause I'm a law enforcement officer I cannot imagine our country without great it is a bedrock of our community it's the bedrock of our constitution\nUh that we have this real ... you know journalism and and and can tell the stories the way they see it in the way they believe in let other people judge but um yeah it was a great glimpse into what we do it for law enforcement show the ... but it's it's also a bedrock of our of our constitution I Believe in a hundred percent\nI got a couple of minutes left so I I I Do want to ask some procedural questions or cause you mentioned a few different things um what do you have districts that used a slow car spike strips so so how does it work um as it is it generally pretty effective if if I go respect strip I'm going to be disabled\nYeah you're going to your your tires are gonna go flat a in probably several police cars phone you're going to are going to go fly to 'cause they're probably gonna have to seem like strips that the hard part have you gone over ... next\nOf but it's always a good laugh when a couple of ... or tires they're very expensive but it has a control but it's not a well you're very aware of them but at the white strips are also very dangerous to deploy you had to get in front of what you guys experience of this is going down one block them coming up the other black and she kept trying to predict you know where it's going to end up\nUh and then you have to get out there in the middle of an open road and you actually got to throw these things across like an accordion I'm pulling back with a string you were exposed we've had police officers you know in the ... get hit will deploying ... what was you know so\nYou know your your author no man's land but again you're you're an average of ... you know almost like Delhi physical force you got hers flying through intersections and ah the risk versus reward a but it's a very interesting to deploy\nAnd then on the subject of the chase 'em I I think I'm curious to know when there's someone who's committed acts of violence in his flying down city streets wherever the case may be any spirit and law enforcement chasing\nYou are I I assume chasing to to keep the suspect insight to understand where they are but ultimately are you what is the sort of end goal of the chase to sort of disabling and obviously the best case is that person stops but their heads up that we are you are you trying to force that person off the road or you try what what's the goal in mind to the chase\nYes so obviously we we've met the criteria to chase to every every player has a policy which uh pursue policy uh so we have the resources reward you know this apprehension has to be made roses me more danger to the public as as a simple example\nOr would that being said our our our our goal is for him to stop you simply put the car and park and put your hands out the window everything's going to be just fine uh from there on our you know it's ... suspect most often they the the the end\nOr where the suspected something bells and what we call bills they run you know they'll they'll hit a certain neighborhood they're comfortable in in in in a get out of the current and go as fast as they kinda foot hoping that we can sort of perimeter around where the running to get a canine out as quick as possible\nSo it's really our goal you know our goal is to stop or second goal is is probably gonna end up with the ... pursuit most often they do\nSo they are most often going to stop on their own and run ... what happens in in a I guess in in a situation where if you're coming from both ends here ... were you forced that that vehicle to stop physically will you try to ... I think to crash into it\nKnowing that the most policies they reconsider deadly physical force with like ... someone with a baton uh\nUh we're not allowed to several blocks as an example unless you're at a deli physical force scenario um so we're waiting for the ... and ... as you listen to the audio the other day you hear the the certain lieutenants talking about ... you know we've got several vehicles they naturally always end up in a train because that's where the suspects leaders\nBut then we try and get as many to the parochial streets as quick as possible because when the bell we were going to have a ... percent of\nGotcha ah we've learned a lot in this hour and I I Want to thank all three of our guests for not only telling the story of what happened last Wednesday but also being willing to do what they do share factor thank you he's here not only represent ... sheriff's department but today for\nDifferent departments are unnecessary there's none of your that thank you and we appreciate that and ... silver all from the Democrat and chronicle a harrowing stuff I Do hope you honestly you take a little bit of time for yourself\nI'm yeah I'm In a minute unplug for a little bit [noise]\nYour glass one sometimes sounds good maybe to bring a recession\nI mean we should object [laughter] yeah no I'm a I'm a ... would grab a few\nBeers and catch up away from work thank you for what you do my right to expand George you think so I really appreciate the work that you're doing that with the Democratic critical skater yeah thank you for having me rub right does the engineer\nAnd Meghan Mac is the producer of connection I Hope your remember because when we say member supportive public radio it's because of you thanks for that we'll talk to them [noise]\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views expressed do not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were under writers the broadcast is meant for the private use to our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent of double the ... the guy you're strictly prohibited connections with ... available as a project just click on the connections linked to believe what the news\nOut of work it is sometimes said that we are lucky to have public radio in our community but really luck had nothing to do with that individual listeners built this service up one of the time and very soon a new member Monday you'll have a special opportunity to join a generous group\nWill be kicking off the ball membership campaign with an invitation for folks that have never quite gotten around to making investments\nYou bet you a dollar for dollar match a wage plus a chance to win an Amazon smart speaker joined us this Monday to help keep public radio strong\nAcross the country prison discipline come down to murder on winning you can get written up or not closing your doors get written up or jumping on the phone without the mission and those low level infraction can have severe consequences like more time\nIt was sad because I'm a mystery yeah I'm In er here who are in low in\nAn NPR investigation this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nThis afternoon at four on do we are you are ...

I played violin for a second and flute for like half a second and I don't really remember much about it\nUm I just was obsessed with it and then eventually it just kind of happened\nTo me give you an instrument or like no I just I just ended up meeting\nLike minded people who played in bands or had instruments around [noise]\nUm and I really wanted to play drums and so I ended up making friends who let me play the drums ... the sort of sounds like the beginning of course of the five court or ... so tell me about that the ... or\nWashington state uh was very different then nobody knew about\nIt and Seattle was not an exciting place to move to Portland much less so we were kind of it it was kind of how people think of Anchorage, Alaska you know we're very remote and um we didn't have\nInternet and stuff like that to just bring us you know just pull the world right over to you you know what I mean and a\nBig companies hadn't taken off there yet it was it was pretty it was kind of and the line as far as you know the United states goes obviously Vancouver was nearby and so [noise]\nWe get bands from they're coming to but it it was pretty\nIt was pretty different and it was very dark it's a pretty ... in my memory it's a very dark place ... um they're nice moments but it it was a strange very strange place to grow up\nYeah um I went to play a little bit of of the song or if that's OK author record [noise]\nWay write this\nSensation is fading\nSleaze sweet the sound of a strange feeling right on ...\nKnowing that you're gonna get away with it and\nAre good men were football you know and I'm not saying\nAnd thank God so you\n\nThe color of your life I was on a\nLeash and shipping and right\nNow I'm scared about mystery\nHere as men extinction of all let us know again age coming on\nUm is the smell does mystery really the league in at a pattern not even not know and how um time a\nMan\nEvery man I Want to defeat them and then [noise]\n\nSource of the high court or off Nico cases new album is called hell on I'm singing that\nSong about the idea of leaving home I guess and faking an ID um why did you need to leave\n[noise] um my ... my parents weren't my dad was somewhere in rural Alaska and my mom just didn't notice [laughter]\nI don't know my my parents were a big drinkers and um drug users and stuff so uh I just really needed to get out of there\nWere you share of where you were going at that time no I had no idea where I was going so what did you like do you have money with you what did you oh I didn't have any money I moved into a friend's parents' basement and I tried to get a job for a while but since I was under sixteen [noise]\nThat was virtually impossible and I tried to go back to school but I was really hungry all the time and I just wasn't learning and I remember feeling really bad about myself because I'm just like well I can I Do good in that class why can't I wake up like Kennedy\nAnd really I was just really hungry and the kid when it was ugly hungry you mean yes it has very hungry and\nGod you know it it's not it's not cool to try to\nLearn if you're hungry [laughter] 'cause your brain just says no and it's really that simple like you need food\nFor your brain to learn and retain the stuff so and especially if you've maybe not had a lot of support at home for what school is you might think that you don't have access to learning and the same way that other people do because there's something else about you but really it's just that because like your physical need aren't taking care of like I'm just thinking with such them with such empathy about what that\nWould that would be like to be trying to figure out figure out your way\nWell when you don't have anybody to tell you what's happening you just think that you suck and you you think you're stupid and ... but then again I I guess I really you know kids also\nReally need they have a real strong impulse to survive and so you you do what you\nCan yeah and uh\nYou know just one thing led to another and eventually you know I I kind of moved home for a little bit and it there's just too much violence and and uh I couldn't say against you or against each other um everyone okay everywhere in every direction [noise]\nWell it's I think that's how most people grow up honestly I don't do you I don't really feel\nI'm a unique in that regard wow I\nI think that's most people's reality yeah I mean based on the people I Know not everyone grow up that way I mean I Hope it's way less than I think but\nYeah\nUm I guess a privilege to think that it's not you know what I mean it is yeah and and\nA man I Hope I Hope I'm so wrong about it yeah me too me too uh Nico cases my guest here on the world cafe or a new record is called ... and [noise] um it sounds like you did a\nA bit of historical digging up in the time before making this album about what it is to be a woman and what women's place in history a is can you tell me a little bit about what you were looking for I guess I'm what you found\n[noise] well I had a lot of\nBad experience with stalkers and a bad experience with the United states government in that regard and bad experience with the law we try to preemptively say things like yeah the country doesn't care about women we treat women terribly and then\nTo go to court and have them treat you really badly and it kind of be in writing\nIs a is a very\nSlapping you awake with the same information you already know and it's ugly it's really ugly and\nThe worst part was watching what it did to the people around me who care about me when did it as they were worried about you and then they watch do you now they are protected by that yeah and and they were destroying themselves trying to protect me\nI just was so angry and so horrible to be around and just hyper vigilant\nA little something extra the biggest reward all of this great programming we're enjoying a terrific performance from Nico case today on World Cafe\nIf you look forward to all of a terrific musical artist that you hear on different radio and especially over the world cafe I Hope that you'll supported that number again is eight hundred to nine five nine nine nine for or you can give online at W. I. T. H. radio dot\nOrg or W. R. U. R. dot org have your new membership\nMatched dollar for dollar from our new member challenge fun on new member Monday to support different radio and thanks\nHey welcome back to an ... of World Cafe with our guest Nico case her latest album is called ... and you could produce that she did some of the recording in Sweden ball her partner Jeff was back in the U.S at our house in Vermont and he goes recording overseas she found out her home was on fire and I asked her about it this summer back when I didn't have a cold\nWhen I look in the liner notes at the album which I really love there's this sweet call out\nMy deepest thanks to you for listening and being caring and curious enough to find out who the people behind them these are we need you and we all work hard\nBecause we truly want to bring you joy support and relief which I think it's such a beautiful sentiment and then it's jacks deposed with these these images on the front there's like a a singed home\nAnd there's all sorts of ... wreckage I guess in disaster on the inside and and I know that there was a a big house fire that happened to you to your home while you were making the album and I was wondering if some of the images that I see inside of here are actually yours like from your house\nAll the ones on the inside are blue you know some of the stuff was so beautiful and and weird and um it's it's just interesting to see what happens when nature gets a hold of [noise] I don't know your\nStuff I read that you had said that when this all happened you were relieved to find that you really did believe that stuff was just stuff yeah it's it's one thing\nTo think you believe something and and you know kind of intellectual lives it in your mind like well of course I Would think that if it happened but then when it really happens and you actually don't care you're like OK shoo I'm Glad because\nI don't want to waste my time or\nEnergy worried about a couch there are other couches in the world I mean I miss\nMy like all my family photos burned up so I don't really have any of that stuff left but it's okay my dogs and cats and everybody made it so\nAnd Jeff most important to me [laughter] so you know and and I was in Sweden I wasn't there for it and that that was terrifying in itself just because\nI couldn't help and I'm a helper and it was like you got the call when it was all done and it was to happen and it was ... happening in your across the ocean ...\nYeah I mean the sure the earring is of of what you were making at the time that this was hot that\nSo what's happening in the idea that the morning but you get this call you're supposed to sing a song bad luck where you think about it's not as bad as I thought it would be yeah but it's still pretty\nBad I mean that it already been written which is pretty I mean at that point you know I went in to the studio and I'm like hey guys my house is still burning burning down think everyone's okay you know I didn't know where the cats were you at that point but they were all fun and\nUh\nYou know I think the Swedes there so pragmatic they're like All right we're here to support you you know and and I'm like well I Know how to go to work so let's work on this so it really was you know I had to laugh about it like there was nothing else to do and\nThe guys were so great to me and you know ...\n...\n... it was really helpful because if you don't release that pressure in some way you're just going to get a little cancer diamond growing out of some charcoal we're Oregon's so\nIt was it was good thing they were given me a hard time in making jokes I needed it bad and so I guess the the vocal performance but you deliver on this song on the album is imbued with whatever you were thinking about it at the time like what do you think when you listen\nBack to the way that it was recorded on on the album on that on that day well to me it kind of sounds like I'm coming off the affects of like a train dart or something like I was a grizzly bear at the dumping somebody darted me from the forest service and I'm just kind of waking up like what what\nAnd I I remember speaking to ... who's one of the mix engineers and [laughter] you know he was one of the people who is really great to me that I Do too and uh I'm like I don't I don't know the local sounds very good and\nHe said well maybe that's what a person sounds like when their house burns don't give them a break men and so I thought about it and I was like okay and and then I thought well I think the thing to do here is to make the backing vocals louder than the lead vocal I think that would be the support the lead books leads\nAnd so in the end that worked out really well um well let's let's hear we did look listen to the the studio version of a bad luck\nGoing right [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI don't want me to do\n\nWith me but\nI'm dreaming is that uh [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh dragon\nJust called to\nTry to train him\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBad luck of headlined by Nico case she is my guest here on the world cafe that that the studio version recorded by in Sweden another thing\nAnd that I wanted to ask you about at that time that this fire was going on which was that it was being reported I'm In Vermont where you live and they were using your name I guess and you
