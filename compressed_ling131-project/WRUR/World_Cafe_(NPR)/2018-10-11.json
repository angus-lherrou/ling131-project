H. D. Rochester\nIt's an encore edition of the world cafe today Talia talks to Frank Turner so\nFrank ... album is called the more kind it's not going to save the world the idea would be more crime it's not a panacea for the love is not a bad first up bring Turner's punk roots an energetic anthems also show up on the album be more kind so do some of his thoughts about the state of the world\n[noise]\nIn the past ... gotten flak from both the left and the right side of the political spectrum and at one point he received hate mail and even death threats\nAre leftist I'm to be kind of a tough guy a punk and tell you I didn't care about the backlash that was generated by then but I did it was horrible Frank Turner coming up on the world cafe\nThis is such a cool conversation and Frank Turner is just one of my favorite a punk rock folk rocker is you know in the spirit of Billy bragging Talia really gets to the heart of that you'll hear that conversation in just a mother but let's get started\nChicken chicken shakes just plenty rate for the cafe\n\nYou get shopping street Schaffer leaves oh can I\n\n\nWell that's kind of you to say I'm trying to be more kind of I Love it I Love it no matter what you had how ... how how does that thing that you get to do work as well your audience I mean I I have spent\nA lot of my life wrestling much professional officers like wrestling with this idea about whether or not I have any responsibilities as a role model or whatever because first of all ... you know I grew up with a punk rock scene in and the thing that attracts me most was the iconic caused them and the idea that it wasn't about\nKind of individuals on pedestals it was about a conversation between equals in the ... punk rock music is supposed to be um I Know so you know my my ... my politics lean towards the ... the libertarian I'm not really particularly keen on ... and I don't want to\nWield the center of my ... is wanting to tell other people what to do having subtle that if I Am going to have people paying attention to what I say that I as I got older I suppose I've started thinking about that little more and\nAnd um you know ... people have said that they work in this album is kind of domestic which is interesting because in ... in terms of its genesis is actually probably the most pessimistic records written\nBut I Will own up to the fact that I'm an ... and I think part of the reasons for that is that I just don't see the point if you're going to make a a normative statement than you might as well do try and do something constructive with it you know so\nRight so you do dabble in on in the popular a popular eat those I guess the political statements\nOn I guess yeah I mean is it reluctantly but yes look like and we can get a song called make America great again yeah ... now and I thought it was not as what's going on in businesses a faculty get hit by the way that you\nYou start this song you say well I Know I'm just an ... ignorant Englishman uh but I like to make America great again yeah why did you want to start a song with that Cathy\nI'm because that was the obvious replacement ripostes that people were going to have those go like well you know from here sorry about my recognizing the several um you know I'm a Muslim actually grow out of 'em and in fact called the ... I was on tour in the states with our friends and plug him only in the summer twenty six team which is when everything starts going really high ...\nElection campaign and um and I should have had this spiel about was saying about um\n'cause I I don't I don't care for the Clintons generally as a thing um but I ... in the same time during the campaign in the ... to the extent anyone's interest in my opinion about this is just\nThe America that I Love I Love America passionately just struck me as back to than a kind of felt real estate agent who now plays a successful one on TV with the um feasible heck of a ... you know I'm an eye on it struck me as it is a\nRepresentation of of of America sort of washed instinct and I would say this on stage in the immediate thing that would come back it'd be like well what what would you know your English um on on some of those I can see that point ... you know myself I get I get ... slightly innovated when people people can have ill informed opinions about for example the parts of the bike\nBut the same time festival I spend the boss drug too much pressure touring locked in America and have done for a decade I'm I'm a complete politics not I I I've been to forty eight states now so you know I'm I played in so I've got some kind of holistic view of the country\nI don't want people to mature on what you said in in picking out and characteristics of the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the ... I Want people to hear that as as ad hominem I can because I think what you take on the on the song is if the principles and the idea that you see take Rite Aid I mean I think\nThat yeah the ... that was discussed in the background for there's some there's some yourself in really particularly about any individual and in fact\nTo go deep into the boats exist for five seconds or I think that the sort of the um ... tendency of the American executive over the last sort of Fifteen Twenty years is a collective problem on both sides of the ... I think that it would be wonderful if it might cost a lot less who the American president\nBecause the system the the three bumps to the legislature executives\nDid you just read what better balance you know I think that would be a good thing I'm an on I think that that's a criticism that as much as anyone is going to listen to what I have to say\nThat applies across the ... he launched um you know I I just think it's a bit of a shame that we're in this kind of winner takes all situation where it's like my God the president's so we're going to completely destroy our opponents for four years\nAnd then you got to get to have a gun is going to do the same thing\nAnd it's just like cool could we not just devolve power a little bit away from the center right so what did you want it to some well the central thing about the song is that I feel that the people who have the expression make America great game written on the hats\nHave in my humble ignorant English opinion missed identified what his great about America unlike brought you a long list of what's great about America if I had to characterize the some it's like that moment when your friends kind of\nLike Hamad in a bar and start showing up the security guy and you go over and you just genuinely kind of have a whisker in there and be like may\nChill out it's cool you know let's just go back to the table and just how to drive a glass of water\nUm some finishes with the lines you know it says um let's be a friend to our oldest friend than cold them out when the full three and a ... to me is part of loving America and wanting to be a friend to America is just putting your hand up when you think it's going the wrong way\nLike okay let's let's hear hatred that in some Mm\nWell I Know I'm\nNot [noise] I like to me again\nHere's my accent and\nShit [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI make America great again Frank Turner ... new album called beat more kind that is a rousing chorus yes and I would think that if people weren't listening really carefully to\nIt is that you're saying and the rest of the core is um\nThey could miss there's now yeah I did you have that fear like when I first heard the song I was like wait wait wait wait what's going on here yeah\nIt's kind of fun when ... lost to people who haven't heard it before because I deliberately don't quite tell people which side of the coin I'm coming down on\nAnd you can see some people's hackles go way way up in the crowd but I I'd like to think that the line about racism is reasonably prominent hopefully provide enough to stave off a kind of Springsteen's fell incident\nNot that I think that I'm remotely sort of on anyone's right our and that level anyway but um I I Know I Know what you're talking about I mean the born in the U.S side with the Reagan campaign that oil or so yeah um I don't I I seriously doubt that not in my future [noise]\nYeah but I think is interesting is that you\nAh you've\nGotten flak from from both sides of the ... that I've gotten flak from the left and from the ... and the right um\nI made me feel like I was doing something right by the way when when when when uh 'cause I actually I got a little five people in the left I'm actually gonna fly from people in the ... and I sat in the middle of ... maybe I'm doing something right well it's\nInteresting though because you haven't claim to speak to people from from any particular side than getting that you've been clear about is is is libertarian beliefs\nI mean I'm not even particularly comfortable with that would actually as I get older because it seems white to sort of stilted ... to me\nUm [noise] so in ... ... what we're hinting at it in in twenty twelve a writer from the guardian collected among political thing you you had sat on and put them together in this article and and and you got death threats\nTold me that ... to sound a little change as well I guess I mean there's some changes ... is sort of that that's kind of the essential idea or is it like\nRather than um if you're talking about substance abuse for example rather than just kind of trying to do that thing of going like ... or you know a an and then you be yourself and then if you if you'd trends grass then you you relapsed times ten because he hate yourself and you're just trying to prove that you're a\nLoser and all that sort of usual stuff that comes with addiction therapies instead of that it's just it's kinda like it's more forgiving but it's supposed to just about the small things it's just about kind of like deleting phone numbers from your phone or just like if you get a certain kind of twitch in the ad then sort of taking yourself to a different borrow taking yourself home or whatever you know it's\nAn and I think that that's the thing is like if you might small changes that up to big changes if you set yourself season Samantha ... tusks\nThen you defeat yourself right from the white guy you know and I and actually that an as some hopefully demonstrates that applies to weigh more than just my own personal foibles it it applies to uh to politics as well I think that if we change the way to go to suck all black my God look at\nIt um it just took about two hours talking beginning if you know um if you say ask yourself the question how do we save up politics than most people are going to end up scratching their heads and having no idea but you know how do we have a conversation with somebody who disagree with how do you um try and find something and\nAmong with somebody who voted for the other guy or whatever you know what I mean I'm the these are small things that you can do that my idol or one of my favorite ones much want to do this month so by the Bush wanted whenever I'm Talking about withdrawing considered the possibility that on the idiots\nLike first well begin with I mean we that well just to just try it and hopefully if you have any kind of like sort of go here in Studio ... will do you will reject that idea but it was just giving you the guard gentleman before you start pounding the table just going to go I'm only the one who kind of\nCompletely enough lay out of my mind that I'm an I'm you know the ability to say I've changed my mind from time to time or in deep to admit you don't quite know and you could do with reading more than the topic or whatever these little changes that we can try and try and make them I think they were up to more intelligent an adult discourse\nWhere we're going to go out on that song and let people like your little changes Frank I Want to thank you so much for being here to\nMonitor ... one thing\nThey did not\nRun\n[noise] wondering what you mean\n[noise] so\nDie for people to bring things and you're just joining or\nLine was drawn\nAngry or China\nThe
