use it for their own purposes and then they send it out to wherever but this this company is starting to like provide metrics and like insights with this data\nBut in reality what they showed there was a map and you can click anywhere on the map and killed at any store and they can tell you like how often people are there like what they buy like they're sort of demographic information I thought it was really a little bit scary I think it's promising for the advertising industry\nBut in my head it generates a brings to mind the idea of like those movies where there's just as everywhere and you can like they're explicitly tell her to you and it's like kind of dystopian future\nI mean maybe I'm like a little paranoid 'cause I'm like in computing security but it freaked me out to be honest\nWhat do you think\nI just think I'm I'm Wondering how this is going to revolve metrics and data becomes so one to one that they are just creating ads for you when you don't understand exactly what you like and when you press the billboard the billboard becomes the ad for you and I just think it's like a science fiction movie I I think this generation\nAs you can see from the discussion we had a super smart\nAnd they're not gonna they're not going to stand for like you know privacy issues and getting financial and healthcare nation out there there's got to be a point of you know that's a good thing from the old days I remember ... hours when one of the seminars\nAnd he looked out of the crowd and he said you know be careful of this stuff because you know in my day we just came up with funny yeah guys are going into people's personal history so you can track them more we just sat down with a pencil and a piece of paper tried to come up with my\nTwo things on that so so number one I think probably when I'm I don't know what the genesis of these sort of individualized uh I I always think about Facebook and Google ... you know the the big tech companies who are pioneering the way of catering\nAds and what we see for ... which is beyond my understanding I think they probably thought first of all that's a good thing you know it'll be more to what you like ... not ... people think that's kind of creepy [laughter] I mean like I'm feeling a little violated yeah um so I Do think that that that interplay ... there's a real fine line there\nI also think um you know going back to ... point on the importance of taking a stand one of the reasons I think brands of brands companies\nWill almost have to just because otherwise what's the point why am I going to watch it I don't have to watch out for the most part I may have to sit through ten or twelve seconds yeah before I watch a video on YouTube but I'm not watching appointment TV at night I don't have to sit through an ad block\nSo if I'm going to watch its advertising in the old classic form I almost have to choose it and I have to have a reason to want to so I Know a lot of people just about everybody I Know who watched the ... wanted to and then shared it and said look at this because you created something that wasn't just funny or a throwaway between show segments it's harder\nTo earn that you can say yeah and the value that you have on something like that can be much harder to create but when the companies do that in a way that they they create that they will get the attention of this generation but you won't if you're just going to just fluff around\nGotta earn it All right so a thirty second space you get to work in his what'd you work in this field I say yeah I Hope to you hope to help them and what and where does that probably take it in\nI don't think any sports I could go anywhere I could go to you know politics praying community pieces anything okay Abby um yes I think that ... really motivated me as kind of feeling a little bit iffy on an ad industry before going on but I think it kind of proved that\nYou have a platform to make a change in advertising and I think that's really important to me so I'm looking forward to explain a career\nIf there wasn't that social change component would you find it much more of a turnoff absolutely that's interesting Daniel\nI'm for me I'm a technical person but I thought a lot of a sort of their problems are really interesting and I would definitely work in marketing but more like the technical side like analyzing the data creating graph but I thought it was really interesting I Would definitely work in the field\nYeah Barry as we get ready to close here I'm In advertising not dead yet they'll know certainly had to adapt\nI think what it's going through now with a huge sort of you know change and it's gonna be interesting 'cause I again sixty to twenty four gyms ears\nThey're going to they're going to shake it up they're going to get out in the world and they're going to sort of create a you know they're going to influence the advertising and created create an industry that's going to be interesting and truthful and stand for things and and maybe even make the world a better place you know you know whatever happens in terms of what they stand for and\nWhat they go well I'd like to ask them since you're going to be in the industry one request is because the hour please stop with the force audio video at\n[laughter] really loud and it drives me crazy a thank you and advance for doing that and

your career like down the road for Eighteen years or something like that yeah I'm ... now different than it would have been back in the day when he started out\nWhen you really get it really down pat you know um [noise] it's it's nice though after doing it for a while to you really get to know city's pretty well and you know where to go and I called the culture walk I get some younger guys with my band and what you do to culture walk today and you know it's like\nYou I've I've made the mistake of touring for a while and you just stay up to eight and have too much fun and then you get up which is great and stuff when you're younger but you sort of dual tour and you're like I didn't see any of the country I was just in those years or so there you know the bar the hotel room\nBut now I'm really pushing the guys to go and go and see ... you know just walk around the block even or just go and go and now I've done enough where no other good coffee shops and the good record stores are and\nYou know it's sort of ... that's where it becomes comfortable in the road like I'm going to go there and you feel comfortable there it's not like it's your first time you kind of have your routine in every city and\nGet up early and and go to a museum and learn something and you know like a it's a good way to you know ... then it's you know just in a band you become a tourist sites here and like you know you pretty much in an RV doing what most retired couples do you know\nSo it's kind of like I Try to do both now and then being a British show you know\nYeah yeah well you at we take

in a studio for us just now with like with no audience in the room is that I got the feeling watching that I did watching at the horse you a couple of years ago at like three in the morning or it hurts your in Toronto wherever sweaty and it's just descended into\nIraq mania so we're way to bring that to us today and good at\nGood I'm Glad we did that and that's where we set up to do so it makes me happy\nYou've done it so you said in that song on the lyric powder ship you think about powder shed um tell me where that can grab 'em\nWell in Nineteen Seventeen in Halifax there was a ... a mission ship a coming into the harbor and it collided with another ship in the harbor and they exploited exploded collusion made a huge explosion is actually the second largest explosion of all time second to Hiroshima\nAnd um it's completely flattened Halifax\nAnd um but they'll find focal Boston, Massachusetts I'm a came and helped us out I was playing last night there and I think the audience for it and uh they sent a bunch of people up to come help rebuild the city and so every year Halifax picks its biggest most beautiful tree Christmas tree looking\nA evergreen intended to Boston we put it in there\nYou know city squares with the traditions from a Halifax to Boston is I think here [laughter] yeah so the sun busted open like a partnership go why it's so weird yeah but only how's it
