I. T. H. in Ithaca\nAnd we are wrapping up our full fund drive today come tomorrow come next week it's going to be business as usual just a lot of great radio available for you twenty four seven\nAnd if you enjoy listening to public radio you've never given before take advantage of the fact that our volunteers who come in to spend a few hours answering the telephones and make a pledge of support why well because this is a service that you use your listening right now you probably lifted earlier this week you're probably going to listen next week as well\nAnd unlike other radio stations that turn to commercials sponsors to pay the bills we turn to our listeners and not necessarily all of our listeners most people would listen to public radio never become a member\nIt's really only a small subset to become listener members and yet they end up paying for about forty percent of the total budget a public broadcasting nationwide it's pretty amazing it's been going on like this for decades works really well\nIt only works really well when people voluntarily make that decision to call to pledge to support their public radio station\nThe bell that's entirely up to you what's it worth to you have you purchased a CD because you heard it on World Cafe and thought I'd like to have a copy of that\nWell that was probably Fifteen dollars well spent maybe you could give us Fifteen dollars a month as a ... member just as a way of saying thanks and recognition of a lot of great music that you've heard here on World Cafe\nAgain that amount is entirely up to you how\nYou give is entirely up to you maybe you don't want to do sustaining but you just want to give a one time gift\nAll of it is valuable all of it adds up all of that makes a big difference on your public radio station eight hundred to nine five di di di for to talk to one of our volunteers or get on line to W.
