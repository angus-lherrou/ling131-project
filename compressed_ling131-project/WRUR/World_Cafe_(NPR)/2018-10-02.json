with the opposition organization with our opposition\nUh you know I I Would say the folks that you know now we're starting to see some issues come up with kiosks and things like that where you're you're actually losing jobs because of this issue a so that was something we opposed the obviously in a carve out for upstate New York which was\nA at least a slightly easier pill for us to swallow but it was something we pose a so we'd have to figure minimum wage reduced to that\nI I I Do if you can snap your fingers I I I Would say that you know we we certainly don't want to see minimum wage move up to Fifteen dollars an hour which is slated to I Believe in twenty twenty there should be a minimum wage at all\nOr the you know there is a federal minimum wage I think obviously that's a not something that I think we've waited into but ah I just think what we're seeing right now with his increase is jobs being driven out of the state and fewer people able to seek employment okay Keith

Rochester chamber the Binghamton regional chamber in the north country chambers was associated builders and contractors\nBut I've often said that I think we are a ... pro taxpayer advocate for upstate New York so if you're a business owner New York state I like to think we're fighting on your behalf\nUm and then the last question on single payer again I I misspoke earlier when I said it was two billion dollars in taxes to two hundred billion dollars in taxes so\nI was off my just a few digits there uh I I just think that this is going to be a huge tax increase of New Yorkers and and the ability to properly fund this is something I just don't think we're capable of and I certainly something that I think our employers would not support\nOr done to our last minute or so we're we're not unfortunately going to be able to get through all the calls that came in for the new executive director bunch crackle upstate Michael Crocker but I I said earlier I Would ask you this so give me number one on your legislative priority was to you think you could get it done this year and you can get one thing done in Albany what's it\nGoing to be what is that one thing I think part of that as being a broader discussion with the business community the pro employer community there are a number of coalitions that were part of it and if I ... I mentioned the business council and sushi builders and contractors and I think we're trying to come together to decide what that is\nWe mentioned scaffold law I think there's a tremendous opportunity for us to address that minority women on business enterprise reformers a big issue\nAnd then preventing things like expansion of our prevailing wage law\nA these are things that I think we're gonna make they're going to be top of our priority list at the start of every year we release our legislative agenda so in the next coming weeks I'm going to be putting together a twenty Nineteen agenda and we'll be announcing that at the appropriate time\nBut this is you know going to be important here a lot of this is going to be driven as to what happens in November and who are using the ... you know controlling the levers of power in Albany\nBut uh no doubt as an pro employee organization we've got her work cut out for us as we do every year but I'm committed to working with my partner is trying to get some successes in one more time on line where Michael ... upstate dot com\nProtecting the tank and I appreciate it Michael Crocker is the new executive director for just about three weeks or so taking the time to come in from his native buffalo does native western New York or any of the\nNew executive director of an check all upset and I know we will see him again on this program thanks for all the calls and feedback from our listeners are thanks engineer rub breathing and producer mega ...\nI'd rather just have a nice afternoon will join us tomorrow on member supported public radio [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W at six right public radio the views expressed do not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use to our audience any rebroadcast were used in another medium without express written consent W where the guy you're strictly prohibited\nDirections with ... is available as a project just click on the connections link that double the ... news dot org\nSupport for different radio comes from our members\n... college art center presenting velvet caravan with Jessica and bass playing tunes around the world blending gypsy jazz a low country swing October Thirteen in the new Glazer music performance center art center dot ... dot edu [noise]\n[noise] drinking water around the country is polluted with potentially harmful group of chemical linked to a wide range of illnesses\nCancer low birth weight thyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects on the immune system\nI'm Ari Shapiro will be chemicals come from and how they might be regulated afternoon on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n\n\nThis afternoon at four on do we are you are ...

[laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's shrimp always a bridesmaid never an astronaut that's the best laugh lines thanks for that kind of um gosh I don't know if I remember the exact moment that fat\nLine hit me but I liked the idea of of being jokey even about big important life concepts you know I think sometimes like\nHumor is a really great way to reach an otherwise challenging topic I wouldn't say that all of my sons or maybe even any of them have like specific agendas but yeah I'm sure that at the last three weddings I went to you know if part of me\nLike heard that little proverb running through my head it a bigger part of it was like probably you know that's a lame like there\nThere are more ambitious Iraq started things to want to be that a bride\nSo as somebody who studied philosophy and who is clearly a very deep thinker um what are some of the ethical and philosophical thoughts that go into you being a rapper\nOh gosh I I don't know if this [noise]\nOh so many [noise] um okay so the first and most obvious one is a you know I'm sitting in the studio as a as a bottle blonde was the first skinned woman [noise] um my mother is Puerto Rican but I don't look at so I think one of the first questions it was like okay [noise] what is\nWhat are the rules are responsible participation in rap I Know that I think about that sometimes I Wish I could say that I had a list of like a really great answers but I think about that a lot more than I used to what I was starting yeah is there one is there one of them that is to you like a real big rules will rapper\nI'd I'd be honest I didn't ... it still um but I Would say that Jim mindful of the fact that I earned through hard work and their talent and through other variables that are actually an earned my position in the world [noise]\nAnd so then just say okay I you know every once in a while if I'm asked to do a job where I think someone could do it as well or better than me I'll say hey you appreciate it if you ask them do this job and if they're busy and they say no\nAnd all those who yeah\nI don't do and I'm I'm not saying that that's a constant practice because it's not but in an effort to figure out how to distribute opportunity a fairly I Know that that's one tactic\nUm I read the part of getting into rap for you had to do with the word count and that you had a license to to say a lot\nUm and I love it that's inherent in your artistry and I think he sort of have that in common with another person with Puerto Rican back on than men while Miranda who wrote Hamilton on who you worked with I think you guys have a lot in common actually I'm flattered and honored yeah but I mean the the the way that you use words and downs to tell stories\nUm I read that if you are if you stretch out all the words in Hamilton it would be like a twelve hour long play or something like that and that he managed to economically tell this entire story through rap in this in this relatively tiny tiny amount of space in real estate\nUm so you worked with him you did at you disarm and Hamilton Mixtape rights which is wonderful um and then also he asked you to sing on almost like praying which is the benefits on 'em for Puerto Rico along with\nJ. lo and Mark Anthony and the ... can you tell me um about getting that call from Lehman well and and how you reacted you know as I had the opportunity\nTo get connected initially with Lynn ... online and I saw Hamilton and was braced for some amazing performances by like multi talented people I mean these Broadway ... people have like\nReally crazy good pitch if you compare them to a lot of pop back and they can dance where I was expecting to be like impressed technically I left like crying into my like the sleeve of my sweater and trying to hide that for my baby cousin who did my first one\nSo the emotional power that thing really struck me and I left um like a small gifts by the stage door of a book that I'd written and I'm a like a little chat\nBook ... uh-huh and that was how I'm\nHelen and I first started a little bit of an exchange and so then when I got the call to be a contributor to the Hamilton Mixtape I did what I think any self respecting an independent rep or do I screamed in my apartment and did a little dance and\nCalled laser beacon anti Thompson my collaborators in Minneapolis to see if they'd be game to help orchestrate and produce this the song and we came up with something that I think all three of us really proud of it's\nAmazing you stretch your voice so far and that song it was so you\nA I mean it was like it's a kind of song of major Broadway voice and so in this I thought man I don't know if we can do this but one of the moon was really exciting about it is I'm recording and ...\nThompson's basement in Minneapolis I I'd headphones on and I could hear his voice to headphones you and I can see him you know some just kind of staring down to the barrel of a microphone\nAnd I tried for those really high notes and I just missed them wildly and he was like okay you know give it a given that we don't get on top of him and he was so I'm just worked for like about it where I think I Would have been inclined to be so embarrassed that oh I don't have the voice for this\nHe was like well you you never tried to like just sit for a minute you know until you get ten or Fifteen times and get on top and I did and then I remember leaving his house feeling like\nWell what somebody not try it if I tried fifth ten or Fifteen\nTimes I might be able to nail which isn't a sentence about me or you know I'm In a virtual aspect voice it's not my strong suit but it was a sense about\nReevaluating what I thought adults could learn um so yeah the expansion of what I had received inappropriately as a fix skill was exciting yeah okay well let's see what you did okay [noise] I\nI'm\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThat's congratulations I Hamilton Mixtape\nPerformance there by my guest death that I'm working with women will Miranda\nI'm you are very very busy human being a very busy or as you all have a book coming out a nonfiction book of essays coming out in September\nAnd ah from what I can lean on line one of one of the essays is called the fool that bets against me and I was wondering if you could tell us I don't want to write I don't want you to give away your book for free church that maybe you could tell us a little bit of that story because I think it said a lot about the way that you approach\nLove and I want to talk about it so a lot of the songs that I've written in recorded on my SOLAR Records have been torch songs and that's a\nThat's like a brand of song that's love sick and kind of pining in our relationship but isn't working out that was been good for my career and kind of lousy for you know my head space for a lot of years\nAnd as much as you can write a sad lumps on my list so many ways to do it you know I remember I had a stomach ache I was reading my mail and I was lying on the ground because we're stomach hurt and I got the guy go\nQuarterly and the guy Kohl quarterly is like a glossy magazine mailer and it's like um surprisingly well done\nFor an insurance company and it\nAnd this particular issue they like ran down some unusual insurance policies so you know sometimes you hear about this and on TV or in a magazine that like some celebrity and shorter smile or legs or her you know her chest or whatever\nAnd\nI was reading about some unusual policies like really unusual ones are big companies will ensure against um abduction for their big CEOs or somebody to kind of an insurance policy against the existence of the Loch ness monster\nAnd then [laughter] and like I was going down the rabbit really what does this and then I read about\nThe insurance policy which was taken out by the silent film star called Ben Turpin\nAnd he had crossed dies and she insured has crossed dies because those are his professional aspect you know he built his whole thing around them so he had like a car made that had crossed dies and Everytime he hit his head really hard he'd rushed to the mirror to make sure that I hadn't gone straight\nAnd she insure them I think I Want to say for like twenty five K. and it was reading his policy that I thought okay well what would my thing be and in some ways I was disappointed to discover the like wow a lot of my [noise]\nMy songs run on heartache like that's my cross dies you know the thing that isn't good for the man but was good for the film star and so from there I decided I Would uh see if I could take out an official insurance policy that essay the flu that bets against me\nBecause I think that as we all sorted out it wouldn't be the case that simply taking\nOwnership of broken models would be an empowering maneuver for women\nSo if we were to say women are sexually exploited but I'm going to fix up and making sure that the beneficiaries of that sexual exploitation\nAre women that's not that's stuck yeah so what's the next ...\nYou got to be able to make your way in the living\nWithout sexual exploitation sex with one was one power mechanism and I think it has its place there's a place for highly sexual eyes are but there has to be a place for art that's not highly sexual lies to that can't be the only door\nYeah we do fire drill for us or well yeah and uh the big banks and members of my band today psalm Matthew Jonathan and Carl yeah\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] I mean I'm a\nLady that is really bad\n\nYou can [noise] and [noise] I don't know why everybody on [noise]
