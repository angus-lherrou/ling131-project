Would I Would I hit the ball and\nRun and it was just fun\nJust being with them and uh they had that song we if you live on a change in my head that together\nAnd I went to see them when they came to Birmingham uh-huh and I was in the dressing room with them and they said we can get you a deal I was Eighteen you get you deal with um with Capitol Records right\nNow if you want to do it and I said

got a\nChance and mom let me [laughter] oh my goodness [laughter] I ended up getting married in the Cold War really\nYeah so that's that and you got married at Nineteen because ... ... well why why how did how do you go from wanting to have this record deal um to to getting married [noise]\nWell I you know after you've seen the world okay I didn't have we'll didn't have a card and have nothing

let's go get some more hamburgers and French fries and [laughter] you know shakes\nOkay and I'm there I was so\nOne thing led to another one and I got pregnant and um my mother ended up uh persuade me to marry him and all that was one of the great at worst mistakes that could have may not really not really I guess it was in the purpose of my life I got four beautiful children\nBehind it [noise] why do you say it was the worst mistake of your life\nWell ... yeah yeah for me personally but not\nFor the gifts I got from it of course you know I'm an I'm understanding that but what but so um what was it about the merits that made it so personally he was very abusive language very abusive to me he was very jealous insanely job was um [noise] I felt like I was in prison I\nCouldn't do anything can go anywhere couldn't look at anybody\nI was like just trapped and um he just um he beat me so badly one night until\nI had to run away from the house that I was in that we shared and next door and my mother and my step father came and picked me up and that was the end the marriage I filed for divorce shortly after I'm so sorry and so then\nSo then at that point you have for your for kids you're on your own [noise] um yeah you've given up the ambitions that you had to get a record deal because your mom encouraged you to to to not do that at the time I'm right so then how how did you figure out how to make it make a living was it music right away\n[noise] no I um moved Cleveland after that with my brother uh I stayed with him for a while and I became a nurse's assistant a in a in a regular hospital\nAnd um I did I refused I don't know what it was go out I just refuse to kind of welfare much just to try to get make it on welfare than normal make ...

career and art and be willing to go on and a bit about your gospel upbringing\nBut there have been there have been times in your career when you've gone back and forth between singing secular music and then really diving deep\nInto into gospel tell me a little bit about about making that ship like I'm thinking about the the first time like in in sixty eight when you said that that you went from from gospel music to singing secular music ... did that feel like a real line in the sand like you were like you were doing something that you could go back from\n... not to me but from the judgment and I got from say the church people ... um the the world loved it you know they love they loved it but the church people were like ... stuck in that old mold\nOr you can't do that kind of music and go to heaven you know and um I was just into the religious\nKind of a mindset and I felt guilty [noise]\nBut it was it was it was a challenge and I had to just think about what what's wrong with it what's wrong with me doing gospel and soul\nMusic it's all about life\nWe live that every day all of us do we go through changes every day we get divorced we get married we we break up we make up we do all these things and just because you Christian it doesn't matter you still go through life that passion that I hear\nIn your voice right there reminds me of watching you preach on the TV show it

Mickey bloom has such a sweet American\nMichelle and what doesn't kill you makes your story longer amen fears to rise to you guys all\n... and\nIs to re purpose and existing facility that town Henrietta has a very in depth comprehensive plan who's goal is to re purpose existing facilities\nUm rather than develop Greenfield so our sites are developed a the utilities stormwater everything's there why not use what's there rather than a pave over a farm fields\nEmma writes on Twitter and says I've changed my shopping habits as more stores in the mall have added social responsibility to their models for instance athletics athletics or as leader\nAh I think it could be and why is it\nOh thank you and they finally settled that have led a or for example\nRecently became a beat Corp made well recycles their genes et cetera so there you go so there's a vote for more social responsibility Rachel says that chicken cooking classes at William Sonoma and yoga classes at a letter and I've enjoyed both why not move these opportunities out into the mall rather than in stores are more people can benefit and enjoy that's not your call is it about why\nThat is we encourage the retailers to do and actually there was a ... I'm a ... class at the center court obese few yesterday at twelve o'clock so uh we encourage our tenants take advantage of of the common areas and the advantages they may offer not only from marketing but for a climate as well\nOK Nancy says on malls explain why Greece won't allow teens without a parrot\nWell that's you know we've ... we had issues a few years ago or where you know and it's always there's a few rotten rotten eggs it's spoil everything for everybody else and we had some issues and that policy was passed and we've received\nA more favorable than not response from the community for that policy um sometimes you just have to implement things to make it a nicer and safer environment for the majority of the population get\nSo right now that policy states yes okay um so I think Emily your tweet was you know um you had a frustrating experience but that's part of a social media is and I think it's generated a really valuable discussion ... ... what do you ... what have you gained from this conversation with Dennis and what do you think about the future of this kind of a shopping experience\nI think it's really interesting to have conversations like this and to know that that people are running malls are open to feedback from the community which is great and it's nice to hear that they're very receptive to having local businesses in the mall you know the late Steve are open to their recently which is great and we talked about village bakery\nUm so I think there is potential for miles to be kind of revived and seeing a new lights the dean hauling concepts we talked about and all of that\nI worked as a CEO target for six years so I'm not by any means saying kill all retail ... so okay good to talk to everyone okay Lindsay\nAnd I still stand by that uh\nStores definitely need to increase their experiences\nUm they need to work alongside of their ... ... e commerce decisions on and create a better experience for the customer overall so even if you are ordering on line when you go into the store you feel it feels cohesive and it's um it's all the same brand and you get the same experience\nAnd Dennis it would be a total trap if I asked you to predict what your property or north like in ten years because that would be me asking you to give away possible changes coming but just speaking broadly ten years from now you think the for that you have Pittsburgh plaza and the three local malls are still here in in many ways and they look largely different largely the same with different function\nThey're definitely all here uh I think they definitely do look different in some respects I the most obvious as the to Sears stores both at Greece and east view I think the tenant mix will evolve to less retail more non retail again like whether that's office hospitality or a residential\nUm but I they are vital they continue to be vibrant enterprises and uh we hope that the direction we're going is the right one\nI don't think I've ever had a mole show or a consumer local show where no one asked if ikea is coming so\nOn behalf of all the ikea fans are we ever well you know and we were we were this close to ... where are you really are they did um it was in the news it was a little premature remember it was just a few years ago are no last fall or no I'm not in the spring I think uh we had the group here\nUh we were on the shortlist and then uh about a month\nLater the the parent Corp in Sweden pulled the plug on all a brick and mortar expansion in the U.
