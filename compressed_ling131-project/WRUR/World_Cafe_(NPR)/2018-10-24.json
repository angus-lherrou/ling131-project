I think at least at the decision to make the album came in large part from time spent on tour with the imposter is when you were playing lots of songs from your album imperial bedroom from Nineteen eighty to\nA drive that right\n[noise] I I Would say that but that was really what to me over I'd been thinking about whether that was a moment we could go back to the studio and I really felt that there wasn't one record that showed the range of things that the the group could do\nBut I could point to particular shows replay where we go to incorporate all the different elements of the band\nBut we often just called on to be kind of a rock and roll by which we do pretty well but obviously I've got lots of different songs particularly the ones written over the last Fifteen to Twenty years and this spam complete the mole\nAnd you know when you think about it I've I've driven them down different roads and say okay we're off to Mississippi to make this record what we went to New Orleans with all due so these are experiences you wouldn't trade ... but we had never sat down with the intention of making a record where we had all the scope we could wishful\nAnd we have to prepare Robert differently than we did with him imperil bedroom but we weren't trying to do a recreational my do you need you to record we we just we were treating it like a stock of songs that some of which we performed since the beginning of this bound in two thousand and two\nUm would you pick a song from imperial bedroom from from Nineteen eighty two that I felt really good to to play on tour that we could just get in our heads as as part of the springboard of inspiration for\nThe new member I Wish I had I mean the the the one that would really come to mind was just before bedtime yeah\nBut because the but the recording of it doesn't do doesn't tell you anything about the story that was in the song really it's a much it's the the feeling of the some of the lyric is much closer to some of the some of the songs like stripping parade rich much bleaker song than than they'd rather joining the way we arranged it but\nIf it really pick one that I think is is closer in in in ... chipping away would be kid about it\nOh is that when you write about the idea that John Lennon got shot yeah well I wrote it that day or you don't really strictly speaking about that but I think it I think this also contain this melancholy because it was just happened to be written that you'd have to be written up thing and we're doing that\nI had to be a very big day for you um what do you remember where you where\nI was a ... you know it was a ... and uh\nI guess the news came in overnight it woke up to remember calling Pete up and said let's just go through you know we read a ... on the river and just talk about you know everything that uh this this might have meant you couldn't find them but you know that those sort of things didn't happen to people in popular entertainment you know they\nThey happened to politicians sometimes ... it didn't happen to people who didn't seem to prefer be provoking anybody to be you know so yeah ... my ... was it was a horrible thing but most most especially for his family you know\nLet's let's listen to some kid about it from imperial that you\nA\nZ in the\nShe's\nA little bit of a\n\n[noise]\n[noise] but then when I was just a little bit on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAnd she still\nLives with other\nThat kid about it often Nineteen eighty two year old bedroom by Elvis Costello that fuels the captain on all this background vocals\nRight here I I hear that it's been pretty eccentric now but when we do you know because I Would have to have this idea that I should somehow disguise my own voice rather than just get other people to sing the other pop\nSongs singing with all sorts of different vocal inflection you know kind of I don't know why it was doing that but it was that's the way I heard them\nSo when we came to perform the same song often the way the launch handed over to another sound in the middle of the phrase\nThat was actually done with the other thing is I kind of made more logical sense I mean there's some there's some definitely willful idea going on with this recording and I love it but when you sing you didn't live performance in that way in a more\nStrictly speaking conventional Coleman response way it's it's a different kind of power and and that's what I think we hear a lot in in the way we had back and forth between the lead voice in the background group in in a lot of the arrangements some look now\nYeah a Elvis Costello is my guest here in world caffeine in the record is called book now a there are few songs on the record at least that we're co written with Bert backtrack a beloved bird yeah but I had a pretty good thing to say I like the way that sound [laughter]\nSee I don't do I like the way that the song sound so so first of all before we hear what you and Bert worked on together can you pick a song of his that that you really love and maybe tell me why\nOh my goodness yeah\n\nI Would you know I'm going to pick one and it's called walk little doggy and it says it is only in real life go to go house to cry talks about a girl going back in her room and imagining for childhood\nUm but this is like the old being sort of shots or by you know adult concerns\nAnd it's just an amazing piece of music I mean some of those songs that they're just they just have so much turmoil in the ... I don't think people really appreciate what what it is he did so\nThere's millions of great songs but not millions but hundreds of songs about road but I'm from ... combined to what will always love to our feet that you could quote but this one's not known so much\nWell let's hear a Dionne Warwick on getting a version of at that time I Walk a little Dolly [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nJust look at me when\nI\n\nMe that\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat [noise] you know one of\n'em [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDi\nDi\nDi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n... ...
