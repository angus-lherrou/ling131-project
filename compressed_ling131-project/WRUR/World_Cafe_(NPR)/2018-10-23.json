stronger we need to have an independent ethics board that has the power to investigate and the power to discipline I'm a poor behavior by elected officials and those who are in the power structure\nThere are other states that are not as corrupt as we are they're not magic it's not that they have angels living there is that they had built in checks and balances in their system we need to have checks and balances about ethics in our system not overseen by the governor not overseen by the governor or the attorney general any elected official and she'll be modeled on what the judiciary has in New York state\nOkay and then when it comes to economic development you said you would disband economic development what Im umbrella groups ups the Empire State development there's like that absolutely on get right on\nBecause they just exist for a to have press conferences and Faye groundbreaking and ribbon cutting for politicians you don't think they've done anything no I don't I think that\nThe um other than the jobs that elected officials correct I think the much better way to do it is to take that money invested in infrastructure and then you can say to small businesses here and expanding business come to Rochester you'll have high speed affordable broadband euros will work your water will be predictable the snow will be picked up now\nIf I'm a company I said great a governor minor I'll do that but I'm going to need a pilot agreement I'm going to need ... ... attacks agreement and as the journalist David Cay Johnston says just about every state is feeling the pressure of saying if I'm the first one who doesn't do these agreements anymore then I'm going to lose you're going to have the wherewithal to say to those companies nope come here anyway but we're not going to be a tax correct\nBecause at that point we will have lowered the tax burden property taxes will be lower because we've taken over uh the local sheriff Medicaid and we'll say we're going to give you\nA performing infrastructure so you need water water is going to be the twenty first century version of oil and they don't have it out west and they're getting less and less in the southwest we have lots of it here so let's make sure that we bring it up to a state of good repair\nMary Lou emails to ... to say she wants to know what are your specific ideas for addressing climate change\nWell I think we have to look I as a matter of Syracuse I open the first officers sustainability excuse me I was difficult for me to say\nUm we have to look at their whole things on the gamut that we can do so\nWhen we again as a matter of talk about let's look at our zoning 'cause we don't have to poor asphalt over every single a face a in every single Laker\nWe can and then let's look at our building codes and making so that we and sent people to renovate or old housing stock rather than engaging sprawl let's look at our car and our fleet and see what our usage for fossil fuel is there and then can we\nUh ... can we minimize that if not a unlimited let's work with are different uh neighbors and see if we can have wind farms and solar farms and at the same time let's take our children\nAnd have them educated in trained in the kind of support that they need in order to build and keep those wind farms a solar panels\nA new power grids are in the state of good repair\nYou're gonna see a lot more wind farms under a minor ...\nI I think it's a combination I'm open to it it's a combination of wind farms solar panels and looking at all of these different things but again doing it in a way\nThat you are both getting the small uh you know the small wins which are is easiest saying you know let's make sure that our building code incense people to renovate housing stock not build sprawl\nLet's not poor asphalt over everything\nOut and as well as the bigger um savings which could be wind farms are could be you know power grids could be um solar panels as well\nRight in our last thirty seconds lender writes to us and says I live near Syracuse I've listened and paid attention to Stephanie minor for many years I admire and respect her\nBut I don't understand what the goal of strategy analysis behind running for governor in this way because you explain what she's hoping to accomplish on the results of the election and what impact for beyond election day which she re engage with the Democratic party [noise]\nSo I look I appreciate that that question\nOh my ... the reason Iran and the nontraditional dishes way as I was approached by members of virtually every single party saying they wanted me to carry their banner and what I realized is that they liked uh my track record of speaking truth to power and talking about how public policy actually impacts people [noise]\nUm but that if I didn't challenge it from the outside that I was just going to be complicit in the system that has broken I ... I plan to continue to challenge it as long as people want to hear my voice in here my stories and be an advocate\nStephanie minor is running for governor minor for and why dot com is the website we invite all the candidates for governor to join us\nWe're an hour long conversation on connections before the election and we appreciate you being they appreciate the opportunity thanks for everybody calling in and sending emails you got it minor Fred Y. dot com we hope get Marshall\nLaw when Arlen Andrew Cuomo before the election we continue to work on that are thanks very near to near record producer never Dusten have a nice afternoon we're back with you tomorrow never supported public radio\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of electric side public radio abuse express your not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcasters met for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent WXXI you're strictly prohibiting\nConnections with Evan Dawson is available at the clock yet just click on the connections that that will be a huge dot org\nVoting rights advocates states are using tactics to minorities from voting at the\nEnd if all goes to the answer to discriminate against racial minorities that I'm Audie Cornish\nConcerts over voter suppression can deter this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\nThis afternoon it for him but we are you are ...
