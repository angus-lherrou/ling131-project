Rochester\n\nHere listening to an aunt or it isn't a World Cafe until years later today are remarkable Nico case\nLaura Dunn\nNico his latest album ally is fascinating hunting for a while she was a recording some of the music in Sweden Nico found out her house in Vermont on fire in day she recorded vocals for songs she had already written called of all things bad luck\nMe go analyze the cake was when the permission engineers I'm like I remember the vocal sound very good piece of real maybe that's what a person sounds like in their house burned down Nico told me about her represent for nature and her childhood in Washington state because parents struggled with drugs and alcohol\nAnd let me go to wander around a kid I basically where the disgusting bathing suit for like an entire summer without taking it off and there was mustard all over the front of the sneaker case it encore edition of World Cafe\nYou might recognize me goes tremendous waste from her work with pornographers we're going to listen to a song by then at the end of the hour or for her so the work and wait till you hear the band Nico brought in to perform with her on the show today we're warming up to that question but the case with one by ... feet into you\n... you know like you know how in a lot of old fairy tales there's evil woods dark woods never felt that way about a piece of nature I felt that there are parts that are dying and there are parts that are very sad but I've I've never felt any sort of\nFeeling of fear like that from nature\nDid you need people around at that time when you were a little kid or do you feel just like the rocks and trees more pals too well I was desperately lonely so I knew I really needed people but um I didn't really have a choice ...\nSo that's what I got into the I mean I had a dog what was your dog's name\nSasha I mean there were several dogs in my life but Sasha was the one\nThat I had when I Lived there oh wow how did you who did somebody give you the dog or with your parents dog\nAnd I I think my mom got\nSomewhere but she was a great she was like a whip it something ... really smart really great dog took good care of me I'm picturing you like running around\nSmall with this dog and I basically where this disgusting bathing suit for like an entire summer without taking it off and there was mustard all over the front of it and like green tennis shoes and it was it probably oh wow\nSo when you come home from a day of adventure with like green tennis shoes in a bathing suit on and and such with the dog would somebody be at home to say like go take a shower no oh wow wow they didn't get home 'til much later in the evening so [noise] uh\nI mean what else was I going to do I listen to a lot of records I hung around outside I looked at bugs I went down to the river [noise]\nUm I looked at plants well a lot of plants were much taller than I was when did music started\nThat part I guess when did you pick up an instrument\nI mean I've always loved music and and I tried a couple of minutes is a little kid like fruit I played violin for a second and flute for like half a second and I don't really remember much about it\nUm I just was obsessed with it and then eventually it just kind of happened\nTo me give you an instrument or like no I just I just ended up meeting like minded people who played in bands or had instruments around [noise]\nUm and I really wanted to play drums and so I ended up making friends who let me play their drums ... sort of sounds like the beginning of\nCourse of the five court or mhm so tell me about the the ice I've pored over\nWashington state uh was very different then nobody knew about it and Seattle was not an exciting place to move to Portland much less so we were kind of it it was kind of how people think of Anchorage, Alaska you know we're very remote and um we didn't have\nInternet and stuff like that to just bring us you know just pulled the world right over to you you know what I mean and a\nBig companies hadn't taken off there yet it was it was pretty it was kind of end of the line as far as you know the United states goes obviously Vancouver was nearby and so\n[noise] we get bands from they're coming to but it it was pretty it was pretty different and it was very dark it's a pretty open my memory it's a very dark place ...\nUm they're nice moments but it it was a strange very strange place to grow up\nYeah um I Want to play a little bit of of the song or if that's OK author records [noise]\nWay write this\nSensation is fading\nSweet the first drink and then I ... you\nKnow imagine going to get away with it and\nYou are good men were full you know and I'm not saying enough to say that I'm In good so you\nIn the current of your life\nI was on a rush and a shipping right\nNow I'm scared about mystery here as many extinction\nAnd hold it is no again age coming on\nUm is this man of mystery really the league ... not knowing how this sounds home a\nHome\nSay\nEvery man I Want to do the town and then\n[noise]\n\nSource of the five poured or off Nico cases new album is called hell on um if you're not talking about the\nIdea of leaving home I guess in faking an ID um why did you need to leave\n[noise] um my ... my parents weren't my dad was somewhere in rural Alaska and my mom\nJust didn't notice [laughter] I don't know my my parents were a big drinkers and hum drug users and stuff so uh I just really needed to get out of there\nWere you share of where you are going at that time no I had no idea where I was going so what did you like do you have money with you what did you oh I didn't have any money I moved into a friend's parents' basement and I tried to get a job for a while but since I was under sixteen [noise]\nThat was virtually impossible and I tried to go back to school but I was really hungry all the time and I just wasn't learning and I remember feeling really bad about myself because I'm just like well I can I Do good in that class why can't I wake up like Kennedy\nAnd really I was just really hungry and the kid when is ugly hungry you mean yes it has very hungry and God\nYou know it it's not it's not cool to try to learn if you're hungry your brain just says no and it's really that simple like you need food\nFor your brain to learn and retain the stuff so\nAnd especially if you've maybe not had a lot of support at home for what school is you might think that you don't have access to learning and the same way that other people do because there is something else about you but really it's just that like your physical needs aren't taking care of like I'm just thinking with such them with such empathy about what that\nWould that would be like to be trying to figure out figure out your way\nWell when you don't have anybody to tell you what's happening you just think that you suck and you you think you're stupid and the but then again I I guess I really you know kids also really need they have a real strong impulse to survive and so you you do what you can\nYeah and uh\nYou know just one thing led to another and eventually you know I I kinda moved home for a little bit and it there's just too much violence and and uh I couldn't stay against you or against each other um everyone okay everywhere in every direction\nLooks like I think that's how most people grow up honestly I don't do you I don't really feel um\nMhm a unique in that regard wow\nI I think that's most people's reality yeah I mean based on the people I Know not everyone grow up that way I mean I Hope it's way less than I think but\nYeah [noise] um\nI guess a privilege to think that it's not you know what I mean it is yeah and and a man I Hope I Hope I'm so wrong about it\nYeah me too me too uh Nikkei has my guest here on the world cafe or a new record is called ... [noise] um it sounds like you did a\nA bit of historical digging up in the time before making this album about what it is to be a woman and what women's place in history a is can you tell me a little bit about what you were looking for I guess on what you found\n[noise] well I had a lot of\nBad experience with stalkers and a bad experience with the United states government in that regard and bad experience with the law we try to preemptively say things like yeah the country doesn't care about women we treat women terribly and then\nTo go to court and have them treat you really badly and it kind of be in writing is a is a very\nSlapping you awake with the same information you already know and it's ugly it's really ugly and\nThe worst part was watching what it did to the people around me who care about me\nPut it in as they were worried about you and then they watch do you not protected by the ... yeah and and they were destroying themselves trying to protect me I just was so angry and so horrible to be around and just hyper vigilant\nAnd there's all sorts of sort of wreckage I guess in disaster on the inside um and I know that there was a a big house fire that happened to you to your home while you were making the album and I was wondering if some of the images that I see inside of here are actually yours like from your your house\nAll the ones on the inside or blue you know some of the stuff was so beautiful and and weird and ah um it's it's just interesting to see what happens when nature gets a hold of [noise] I don't know your\nDuff I read that you had said that when this all happened you were relieved um to find that you really did believe that stuff was just stuff yeah it's it's one thing to think\nYou believe something and and you know kind of intellectual lives it in your mind like well of course I Would think that if it happened but then when it really happens and\nYou actually don't care you're like OK shoo I'm Glad because I don't want to waste my time or energy worried\nAbout a couch there are other couches in the world I mean I miss\nMy like all my family photos burned up so I don't really have any of that stuff left but it's okay my dogs and cats and everybody made it so and Jeff most important to me [laughter]\nSo you know and and I was in Sweden I wasn't there for it and that that was terrifying in itself just because I couldn't help and I'm a helper and it was like you've got the call when it was all done and it was happening with Halloween happening and your across the ocean ...\nYeah I mean the through the ... of of what you were making at the time that this was hot that this was happening and the idea that the morning but you get this call you're supposed to sing a song bad luck where you sing about it's not as bad as\nI thought it would be yeah but it's still pretty bad I mean that it already been written which is pretty I mean at that point you know I went in to the studio and I'm like hey guys my house is still burning burning down\nThink everyone's okay you know I didn't know where the cats were yet at that point but they were all fun and\nUh you know I think the Swedes there so pragmatic they're like All right we're here to support you you know and and I'm like well I Know how to go to work so\nLet's work on this so it really was you know I had to laugh about it like there was nothing else to do and\nThe guys were so great to me and you know ...\nYour barn or sorry\nBecause it was really helpful because if you don't release that pressure in some way you're just going to get a little cancer diamond growing out of some charcoal near Oregon's so\nIt was it was a good thing they were given me a hard time and making jokes I needed it bad and so the I guess the the vocal performance but you deliver on this song on the album is imbued with whatever you were thinking about at the time like what do you think when you listen\nBack to the way that it was recorded on on the album on that on that day well to me it kind of sounds like I'm coming off the affects of like a ... or something like I was\nA grizzly bear at the dump and somebody darted me from the forest service and I'm just kind of waking up like what what\nAnd I I remember speaking to last a Milton who's one of the mix engineers and [laughter] you know he was one of the people who was really great to me that I Do too and uh I'm like I don't I don't know the local sounds very good and\nHe said well maybe that's what a person's sounds like when their house burned down gears a little break men and so\nI thought about it and it was like okay and and then I thought well I think the thing to do here is to make the backing vocals louder than the lead vocal I think that would be the support the lead book leads and so in the end that worked out really well um well let's look here we did look listen to the the studio version of a bad luck\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI don't want me to\nTo me but\nI'm dreaming\nThat ah [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh jogging and\nJust called to\nTry and train them\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat's bad luck off ... case she is my guest here on the rock cafe that the the studio version recorded a in Sweden\nAnother thing happened that I wanted to ask you about at that time that this fire was going on which was that was being reported I'm In Vermont where you live ... and they were using your name I guess and you found it that they were using your name in reporting on this fire and you said you said today is

listen I'm not asking for you to take the story out just please take my name off\nI have a seriously life threatening situation and I I really need you to take my name off there and he was very condescending and you know most of my house burned down and you know and I was like no you don't understand this is\nThis is a big deal like I've spent my life savings trying to remedy this um you know my house I sold it because I couldn't you know\nPlease just please take my name off and we sold it because you didn't want to have your ... name yeah on but you still live there but yeah ... yeah that's how bad it was it was really really bad and\nAnd and uh I I\nWas like I have a daughter you know like come on what what do you I can I can hear the gears just I have the tiniest modicum of

street bridge in New Orleans about Memphis the whole ... maybe the grand old Opry worthy of home\n... inviting you along to all of these places and many more as we explore the experience of drain American music above board for mystery train\nTomorrow night it's six different radio\nHey we'll come back to World Cafe until the ...\nOne of the things that's been so fascinating is so important about the me too movement is that having these public conversations I think it's me a lot of people feel really differently about their own personal experiences uh and when ... came in\nTo talk about her latest record the future in the past she talked about the song Vinnie here it's called last\nAnd she said when she wrote it it was this really personal song that she thought she was writing\nAbout past relationship but thinking about it through the lens of this big public conversation we had about me to meet her here to San differently made her think about her personal experiences differently slip pebbles into this one real close\nIt's not only perhaps a future in the past ... ...\n\n\nTwenty years later with this kind of political climate how are we able to forge a consensus on an issue like this about giving nuclear weapons it's not about even banning testing at an international level we're talking about giving you and that's where I think my sense of optimism decrees\nSure in this country there is going to inevitably be some sort of political debate that says well your week if you give up those weapons or that you're jeopardizing this country's safety my own very amateur observation of President Obama was that he might very well have been someone who was much more interested in an\nAggressive course of a stockpile reduction in all kinds of sort of\nA sort of nebulous seem more peaceful ideas but he also had to play the political game of not looking weak not looking weak is the first president of color you know there's all kinds of things I think he had to consider that complicated but that ... that that the amateur observation I have I I Wonder now\nI think you put it right and I think you've got the word the the objective was the address of the the adverb let's say aggressive sorry\nUm and I think an Obama pursuit some of these and he he he laid out his vision it was an ambitious and aggressive fish and that he laid out and is Prague speech and I think that's where it became politicized and I think and then ... being the recipient of the Nobel Prize so you would you would you put symbolism before substance and\nAnd we we needed to do a lot of work on the substance we needed to restore our faith in these multilateral institutions that could take the lead to get to where we need to get to um yes we we have to take the leadership role but simultaneously ... needed to work with those international institutions\nTo compliment or efforts in some of these to advance in some of these critical areas\nAnd then you know work to our own political process\nI got a few minutes left her so I'll ask you what what worries you most of what is keeping you up at night most are key sort of monopolizing most of your time at\nWork these days I think I think that's our first point which is the Afghanistan work and I think some um the other part that keeps me up at night and the other problem that we worry about is um which we did not touch at all in this interview with the whole in the Pacific which\nObama at you know I'm In a bureaucratic where the um the hyphenated into Pakistan issue in the sense we ought to special representative for Afghanistan in ... the ...\nAnd then you had a person and south and Central Asia dealing with the Indian issue and then you had an Asia Pacific policy\nWith this administration has done like you said that South Asia policy is largely and a half pack policy but the India policy at many levels is also seen as a part of the Indo Pacific ... that's where two thirds of the humanity lives today that's the center of global economy in some sense\nAnd we have the big actor that that I'm In the form of China that can from the United states and many of these in that part of the world and I think that's that's an area that we need to worry about and that's an area that has a potential for the risks and things going wrong and that's a strategic issue for the United states\nWell then leave us in our final minute with what really could go wrong give us some exciting things to think about that [laughter] and they noticed that um\nThe trade war going in I'm In a largely unfavorable direction some accidents happening in the south China Sea\nOr China's penchant for micro aggression and not knowing where to stop drawing the United states into a conflict that it does not really want to get engaged in and at the time where we are engaged in Syria ever engaged in Afghanistan really engaged in Russia\nAnd how many battles are we're not position to fight this fight\n[noise] do you see the trade a trade war as I guess so to speak already escalating as it is it in a bad place\nNo I don't think it's I don't think it's a bad place for the United states you're I Would you know actually backed President Trump in the sense our economy is booming rate and um you know China has in some sense taken advantage of the a trading system that the United states developed in Nineteen forty five in Nineteen Seventy eight\nWhen they opened up and have confronted us and have 'em you know and confront that the United states\nSo um so I think given 'em I'd on we have no incentive to negotiate so I think it's going to escalate are you there there's a\nOr for for a moment of optimism doctor for a bill ... is director of the south Asia center at the Atlantic council in Washington generous with
