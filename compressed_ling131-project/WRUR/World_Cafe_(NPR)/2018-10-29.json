music that you're hearing grant Cox and who scored a television series and it is also the name of his new soundtrack album which is available now\nYou know um we've interviewed a lot of guests on the world cafe in the last year and a half and so when I saw that your album was a a called the end of the uh leaping world I'm like oh God I another uh applied\nCurrent political state kind of thing but what I found so fascinating is his record really sort of is is intimate and yeah and it's sort of less concerned about the whole state of the world but the state of these two characters in in in their place in this world\nYeah yeah I mean really it it seems that I Do I don't know you know it's it's it's sort of eighty nation isolation I I can write I really ... song you know in these shows and being at the moment I'm as I'm starting one of the songs at the end of the you know my gosh another ... showing United\nAs you know this very romantic and I'm\nReal city acoustic guitars a good um weapons to some heavy playing and I'm a few ...\nNo I mean it's capable of slang fascist sit can do a lot of damage they can they can do a lot of different things ... grant Cox and our guest here on the world cafe can you set up to the next time you're gonna play angry me yeah we're angry\nMe this was kind of men to be you know the nineties kind of what did they call it ... if I wrote a book or the day that's my name for maybe it's just meant to be something that she drank James the boys kind of mixed into and he's had fans at the beginning and the kind of teens so I can I can do that some ...\nAbsolute again it's kind of a fun size song enjoy that maybe all good it's all good\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'm\nNot angry lately that I was wrong\n... lately I don't know what's wrong\nStaring at

toxins our guest on the world\nCafe [noise] some and I I Know you\nKeep up with the hip hop a beef you know maybe you don't okay um but it feels like the world to Britain pop beef yes has come to a close for the most part and you know looking back on it now with the prospect of do that you have do you think at any point that affected the music you made\nIn the sense that there's so much gossip and there's a competition and who's going to be the biggest band and does that do you think that ever affected the way you make music\nI'm not really affected my kind of um my life every\nDay in a negative way particularly I guess when I go out I'll be constantly reminded me of something I didn't particularly want to be reminded of that I was sort of ...\nIn competition with other bands virus um or that I was a south and middle class English past summer and all of those things weren't particularly true in the ... and\nSay yeah I mean I sort of in my general life these things um you being sort of talked with the same brush as as as lots of other people um but music scene not I didn't take much of anything ready coming out being listened and music anyway throughout the nineties\nSo it was almost like a solid it's almost like the solace the studios where you could like actually work and not feel like you're being judged on who you're ... who you are in your background and you know it's so interesting because that's part of the ... thing that most Americans don't know about it's not just the music that you're making but your social\nBackground and and whether you were working class or boozy and stuff like that so it seems like it's nice that you had a place that you could get away from that\nYeah we left the studio you know I mean we we weren't really taking notes if anybody and you know people are big fans of the British pop band and and all of that how how seeing may not appreciate that all of the bands that are considered pep talk\nBut probably not fans of each other they're friends of other people and doing that and they were doing the right thing and they were all come together and probably find it quite amusing that that there was a Brit pop thing into you know to me the British kind of derogatory or they think it's a very it's a NICE Road\nI'm so sorry it's a bit of an out a bit of an odd one because a lot of people what kind of trying to reenact and have their their sixties and a kind of another six days and um and and so I've um naively I suppose I was as well thinking everything in the sixties ready right\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]

the\nOrange jumpsuit and non Jews [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n...\n\nOf you know when\nAnimal shows\nInto a room new version of\nWhere\n\nIs a big is the\nThing is ...\nEmail us ...\nBit\nDidn't get the main thing\nMe in ... in New Orleans\n\n\nAnd they're Johnny\nI'm feeling a\nLittle fun\nI think again you know\nYou on the one [noise]\nBeen men are\nOh\nTrust\n\nYeah it's really the only\nAll right well you\nOh\nOh\nOh\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\nAnd what you have is families walking hundreds of miles through dangerous territory to escape that kind of violence or now you don't have to want open borders and recognize you need some ability to determine who comes into who doesn't\nBut the fact is there are centuries of international law and we abide by that international law about people who apply for asylum\nAnd what we have here is a group of people who want a better life who believe America could provide them with a better life\nWhat we've done in response before the care of and separating families taking away children deliberately uh establishing a policy so that those families would not be reunited in many cases putting them into conditions that were absolutely horrific\nIs I Would say the antithesis of what American values are supposed to be\nAnd the idea that this caravan is being used as a a ploy to suggest that these are a bunch of evil people coming to bring ... or a crime to America\nIs a beyond the pale and that people who are hearing about it starting with the president but moving on down through the kind of media sources that we're seeing including on Fox and friends just today\nAnd believing all of this it does play into a kind of seen a phobia that has a long history in America remember that Abraham Lincoln in part reacted against the no nothing party which was against bringing Catholics to America\nSo Catholics Jews who saw the St Louis uh bringing refugees from Germany turned away and most of them perished ... when they got sent back to Germany\nBut all Americans who came from immigrants ought to be more sensitive to this you gotta have a balanced policy and there isn't an easy way of dealing with it but to use it as a political tool to win an election I just find is reprehensible\nTook me about two minutes or less on what you want America to do now if you've seen all this divide\nSo you know one of the things about our book as we wrote it was deliberately trying to be a little bit optimistic a it's a hard thing to do these days but we have seen a lot of people in civil society\nJolted by what they've seen this is not politics as usual this is not a ... a society operating as usual these divisions can work even in America to drive us apart and into sectarian warfare almost\nAnd we have lots of people I think we're starting to emerge and fight back against that\nAnd the fact that just last night in Rochester there were thirty five hundred people who showed up at a vigil\nFrom I think across the spectrum that that's happened everywhere in the country\nThat we're seeing a violence occur if violence if you go back to the horrible killings at the church in Charleston\nTwo the two people killed or African Americans killed in Kentucky and more would have been killed if this horrible person had been able to get into the church while that service was going on to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think we have an opportunity here to begin to separate out that small corner of people who really are harboring evil values\nFrom the rest of the society to seeing that we can't go on in this direction\nAnd then thirty seconds from within the system to someone like Senator Ben Sasse get credit from you for wringing its hands about it or did they have to do more to get the credit\nSo I Know Ben Sasse a Jeff Flake has been a longtime friend of mine Bob Corker has as well and Susan Collins and my reaction is words are not enough\nYou are in a position especially if you're a senator and a fifty one forty nine Senate\nTo change things you could change the behavior of this administration you could say I'm not voting for any judge coming out unless you altered the child separation policy just to pick one example and you've got enough power to block all of that from happening to force action\nNot one action by any of them and that I find is just really really\nHorrible the book is called one nation after Trump thank you for spending an hour with us here today and it was a real pleasure and your busy schedule norm orange stink tonight Andrea\nTell us what's coming up tonight
