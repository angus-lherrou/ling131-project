know not not when I\nGet mine na na\nNa\nNa [noise]\nYeah some of the time most about that ... or ... year on the world cafe the new album is called a karma for cheap [laughter]\nWhich I you know the more you reflect on that then I I I enjoy that because the whole point of karma is you you get out what you put it in just something shift show ... were you know and what what are you hinting at with that message there [noise] um\nYou know at first it was just a lyric a ... it's a lyric from the first song on the record which is called if not now when I'm and uh at first it was just something that made us laugh um and uh I\nI really enjoy a music that has a sense of humor to it you know the Beatles and Harry Nelson and the kings and and and stuff like that I really love\nThe sense of humor and and all that kind of music I'm Tom Petty too you know he really is a great sense of humor but\nI'm so at first it was just something kind of funny I think I'm over time it's it's become for me at least in my mind a little bit of that thing of where I'm you know people always want\nA these things I'm\nFor nothing that you can't really have for free [laughter]\nEven even recorded music you know what I mean I mean it's like\nThat even even if you were getting it for free it wasn't free\nTo get it to you to get in the first place [laughter] so you know there's there's a lot of instances of that in our culture and society today where people seem to want a short cut some how to get to something that is\nUm maybe takes a little bit more and sought and time to really develop\nUm which is beautiful and the journey as part of what makes it special once you have it so why would you want to\nCut all of that part out and just go straight to the you know under your eyes at the end of the rainbow as it were\nAaron Lee ... is our guest here in the world cafe karma for cheap is the name of the new album next\nSong or you're going to play for us is called the truth is so hard to believe and I'm I'm guessing it's another tie a song that sort of touches upon smooth themes of the record what were you going for here\n[noise] um I think you know that was one of those songs that that title just kind of appeared or I thought all this kind of funny\n[laughter] I mean yeah I think it's a universally good title no matter when you came up with an obviously maybe it's a little bit more pressing now but yeah it certainly plays into a lot\nMore of of of sort of politics and all that kind of thing that I had ever intended ah originally um but I mean I make music so that people can connect to it and hopefully find themselves in there somewhere and if that's\nHow they connect to it and and uh relate to it then I'm happy for it to be whatever you know makes them happy for me I think it's it's about um the truth you you tell in and don't tell yourself and trying to\nRecognize a when that's happening um because you don't always you know um you might be [noise]\nYou just have a lot on your mind or maybe you're stuck under you know I don't know but but the point is you know ... you wanna you want to consider\nWhat you're telling yourself the same way that you would consider what you're telling another person and so I think that's maybe a little bit of what I was trying to get to and that's all\nI like it looks listen to it Aaron Lee testing here on the world
