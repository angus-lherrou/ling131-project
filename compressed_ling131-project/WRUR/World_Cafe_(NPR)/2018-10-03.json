fired by a unique experiment get that she recruited a team of scientists to try and locate the spot in the brain responsible for heartache through an MRI scan that he was trying to get over a loved that just wouldn't go away I think a lot of us have wondered like\nAm I choosing to love someone can you choose to stop that that is a truly gifted word Smith and what a fan and fellow rapper and Hamilton ... deaths that to perform\nOn his Hamilton Mixtape and she was pretty excited I did what I think any self respecting independent rapper do like new screened in my apartment and did a little dealt death to perform live music from her latest album\nChime on World Cafe\nOr you get off with a song I think you're going to recognize before we get to the music that I think we'll be moody but I guess that it's all black God put a smile on your face\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nWe're new ... new book\n\nGod is the only ...\n... ...\n\n...\n...\n\nDaughter to see a way\n[noise]\nGumbo the ...\n[noise] good [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat's shrimp always a bridesmaid never an astronaut that's the best laugh lines thanks where did that come from um gosh I don't know if I remember the exact moment that fat line hit me but I like\nThe idea of of being jokey even about big important life concepts you know I think sometimes like humor is a really great way to reach an otherwise challenging topic I wouldn't say that all of my songs or maybe even any of them have like specific agendas but yeah I'm sure that at the last three weddings I went to you know if part of me\nLike heard that little proverb running through my head it a bigger part of it was like probably you know that's a lame like there\nThere are more ambitious Iraq starts things to want to be that are bright\nSo as somebody who studied philosophy and who is clearly a very deep thinker um what are some of the ethical and philosophical thoughts that go into you being a rapper\nGosh I I don't know if the [noise] oh so many um okay so the first of all most obvious one is a you know I'm sitting in the studio or as a as a bottle blonde or is it fair skinned woman um my mother is Puerto Rican but I don't look at so I think one of the first questions was like okay\nWhat is\nWhat are the rules for responsible participation in rap I Know that I think about that sometimes I Wish I could say that I had a list of like a really great answers\nBut I think about that a lot more than I used to what I was starting yeah is there one is there one event that is to you like a real rural rapper I'd I'd be honest I I didn't ... it still um but I Would say that\nJim mindful of the fact that I earned through hard work and your talent and through other variables that are actually an earned my position in the world and so then just say okay\nYou know every once in a while if I'm asked to do a job where I think someone could do it as well or better than me I'll say hey you are to appreciate it if you would ask them do this job and if they're busy and they say no\nAnd others who yeah\nI don't do and I'm I'm not saying that that's a constant practice 'cause it's not but in an effort to figure out how to distribute opportunity a fairly I Know that that's one tactic\nUm I read the part of getting into rap for you had to do with the word count and that you had a license to to say a lot\nUm and I love it that's inherent in your artistry and I think he sort of have that in common with another person with Puerto Rican back on than men will Miranda who wrote Hamilton on who you worked with I think you guys have a lot in common actually I'm flattered and honored yeah but I mean the the the way that you use words in towns to tell stories\nUm I read that if you ah if you stretch out all the words and Hamilton it would be like a twelve hour long play or something like that and that he managed to economically tell this entire story through wrapping this in this relatively tiny tiny amount of space in real estate um so you worked with him you did at you disarm and Hamilton Mixtape rights which is wonderful\nUm and then also he asked you to sing on almost like praying which is the benefits on 'em for Puerto Rico along with J. lo and Mark Anthony and we Fonzie can you tell me um about getting that call from Lehman well and and how you reacted you\nKnow as I had the opportunity to get connected initially with Lynn ... online and I saw him Wilton and was braced for some amazing performances by like multi talented people I mean these Broadway ... people have like\nReally crazy good pitch if you compare them to a lot of pop back and they can dance where I was expecting to be like impressed technically I left like crying into my like the sleeve of my sweater and trying to hide that for my baby cousin who reports on\nSo the emotional power that thing really struck me and I left um like a small gift by the stage door of a book that I'd written and I'm a like a little chat\nBook of poetry uh-huh and that was how I'm\n... and I first started a little bit of an exchange and so then when I got the call to be a contributor to the Hilton mix tapes and I I did what I think any self respecting an independent rapper who do like screamed in my apartment and did a little dance and\nCalled laser beacon anti Thompson my collaborators in Minneapolis to see if they'd be game to help orchestrate and produce this the song and we keep up with something that I think all three of us really proud of amazing you stretch your voice so far and\nThat song it was so I mean it was like it's a kind of song of major Broadway voice and so initially I thought man I don't know if we can do this but one thing it was really exciting about it is I'm recording and Andy Thompson's basement in Minneapolis\nI I'd headphones on and I could hear his voice to headphones you and I can see him you know so I'm just kind of staring down the the barrel of a microphone\nAnd I tried for those really high notes and I just miss them wildly and it was like okay you know give it a given to go get on top of him and he was so I'm just working for like about it where I think I Would have been inclined to be so embarrassed like oh I don't have the voice for this\nMusical you you'd never tried to like just sit for a minute you know until you get ten or Fifteen times and get on top\nAnd I did and then I remember leaving his house feeling like well what somebody not try to try to fix dinner Fifteen times I might be able to nail which isn't a sentence about me or you know I'm In a virtual aspect voice it's not my strong suit but it was a sense about\nReevaluating what I thought adults could learn um so yeah the expansion of what I had perceived inappropriately as a strict skill as exciting yeah okay well let's see what it did okay [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThat's congratulations I Hamilton Mixtape\nPerformance there by my guess death that I'm working with women will Miranda\nI'm you are very very busy human being a very busy artist you also have a book coming out a nonfiction book of essays coming out in September\nAnd ah from what I can lean on line one of one of the essays is called the fool that bets against me and I was wondering if you could tell us I don't I don't want you to give away your book for free church that maybe you could tell us a little bit of that story because I think it says a lot about the way that you approach love and I want to talk about it\nSo a lot of the songs that I've written in recorded on my SOLAR Records have been torch songs and that's a that's like a brand of song that's love sick and kind of pining in our relationship but isn't working out that was been good for my career and got a lousy for you know my head space for a lot of years\nAnd as much as you can write a sad love song like somebody who has to do it you know I remember I had a stomach ache I was reading my mail and I was lying on the ground 'cause we're stomach hurt\nAnd I got the Geico quarterly and the guy Kohl quarterly is I guess ... magazine mailer and it's like um surprisingly well done for an insurance company\nAnd it and this particular issue they like rent\nAnd down some unusual insurance policies so you know sometimes you hear about this and on TV or in a magazine that like some celebrity insured her smile or legs or her you know or her chest or whatever\nAnd I was reading about some unusual policies like really unusual ones are big companies will ensure against um abduction for their big CEOs or somebody to kind of an insurance policy against the existence of the Loch ness monster and then\nI like I was going down the rabbit really what does this and then I read about the insurance policy which was taken out by the silent film star called Ben Turpin\nAnd he had crossed eyes and she insured has crossed eyes because those were his professional aspect you know he built his whole thing around them so he had like a car made that had cross size and every time he hit his head really hard he'd rushed to the mirror to make sure that I hadn't gone straight\nAnd she insure them I think I Want to say for like twenty five K. and it was reading his policy that I thought okay well what would my thing will be and in some ways I was disappointed to discover the like wow a lot of my [noise]\nMy songs run on heartache like that's my cross size you know the thing that isn't good for the man that was good for the film star and so from there I decided I Would uh see if I could take out an official insurance policy that essay the food that bets against me\nTells the story of trying to ensure the heartache that was feeling a lot of these songs wow you also did another really interesting with heartache um did another really interesting thing was heartache which was try to locate it force in your brain yeah um\nOwnership of broken models would be an empowering maneuver for women so if we were to say\nWomen are sexually exploited but I'm going to fix up and making sure that the beneficiaries of that sexual exploitation are women\nThat's not a fix that stock yeah so what's the next ...\nYou got to be able to make your way in living without sexual exploitation sexes one was one power mechanism and I think it has its place\nThere's a place for highly sexual eyes are but there has to be a place for art that's not highly sexual ... to that can't be the only door it yeah we do fire drill for us oh well yeah and a a big thanks to the members of my band today ...

D. my name is L. J. I. R. I. [laughter] I'm like this\nBut I'm really just be open to it um you never know what you find\nOkay uh definitely what do you want to leave the listeners but there's we I'm ... I'm sure you still have you think the march of progress for people with disabilities is on a roughly steady if slow moving straight line up words or you know I I also wonder if if you think we step back in any way\nI think as an activist um and what I like to remind myself and all of my staff is that you have to stop and look at the progress otherwise you'll start to feel like nothing's moving forward and so on it's actually when I was in training for Senator Harkin and when we were taking a picture together he like let me see just came up that curb that without the ADA that group that wouldn't have been there\nYou know sometimes I just have to look at the curb cuts\nUm to remind myself that we are making progress but there is a lot of progress to make on the planet is important but someone stuck in a nursing facility can't get employed because you can't get out of there to get to your job so we've got to work on that as well but also for disability rights is here to help\nLocal and players if you don't know what your responsibilities are as an employer we want to help you if you don't have the right to their disabled employees are then let's help you if you don't know what a regional combination as call me because all the way it is for our community be more inclusive more welcoming of disabled people\nSo that we can all grow better together we are a city that is in poverty all of us are so let's get out of it together and let's not leave anybody behind especially disabled people\nAnd our last thirty seconds let me read an email from tests who says I Want to echo senator harkens assessment that those with disabilities regularly rise to the best of employees as a customer I've had good reliable customer service at the pen feel target where I regularly check out with cashiers were visible disability such as deafness these are connected\nMy aunt went to the Iowa school for the deaf at a time where\nHer hands were slapped for using sign language when you worked for senator Senator Harkin you signed to her our family always\nRecognize how important she was you were the first politician to do so blessed you some tests [noise] awesome stuff isn't it that's where my brother went through um awesome stuff while listening senator thank you for being here thank you very appreciate the work that you have done on this continue to do and great to have you in Rochester thank you very much and good luck with a six year old you're picking a [laughter]\nI'm going to pick up a six year old\nBut for all of wherever you are this this\nYou think about what you heard from Stephanie Woodward it from the center for disability rights and Jay before as who is working with the rock employee ability conference tomorrow Susan Hetherington from Rochester strung Center for developmental disabilities thank you all of you and good luck tomorrow and another upstanding an important event for our community thank\nYou ain't NATO's makes it raw Brandon engineer mega ... producer I met the dos and have a wonderful afternoon to talk to you tomorrow [noise]\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views express your not necessarily represent those are the station\n... step management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast were used in another medium without expressed written consent of W ... you're strictly prohibited\nDirections with Evan Dawson is available as abroad yes just click on the connections link that double the what the news dot org\nSupport for different radio comes from are members\nFrom ... theater presenting hair the love rock musical that celebrates the sixties songs like Aquarius and let the sunshine in onstage through October seventh tickets and information online at ... theater dot org ...\n\nOn Sunday Brazilians vote for their next president and also just many women are not happy with the choices\nWe've had enough and not only women but yeah I'll give you the community and all minorities in the world who feel like they are not represented in politics\nI'm Ari Shapiro women are protesting Brazil leading candidate with the hash tag ... not a story this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News\n\nThe afternoon at four on do we are you are ... Rochester\nHey you're listening to World Cafe on ... today and it's done by Dolly Parton\nLike a musical theater meat pop anthem meets Dolly Parton and it's amazing it's an amazing dawn recognize that voice not all the guys that is my guest ...\nWho co hosts radio lab and treated the spinoff series more pressing the show's third season just launched in ... bills around a brand new album called twenty seven perfect album jab in his team's got a bunch of art is to write songs inspired by wait for it meant for the U.S constitution\nAll these songs he fired by the nineties amendment which gives women the right to vote [noise]\nSome of this on their history lessons like Dolly summer tiki are taped whether you're defend your band arch interpretation every twenty Fifth Amendment you know the one about the presidential succession plan job I'm rod is here to share music from the most perfect album\nCafe\nStarting it up with a song not inspired by an amendment to the U.S constitution this is one by you or at least I don't think so I don't think this is you do with stay far away [laughter] [noise]\nDan [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAs a music married that kills me [noise]\nIt's just like this underwater be\nNice\n\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n... all day stunning pretty [laughter] so that's the first artist they heard back from it yeah and the first time that you would have heard the first song I think or at least one of the first songs that you're going to play in season\nThree of more perfect has to do with the first amendment yeah to some missions for the first yeah which is also really quite interesting yeah um I Want to talk about Julie styles submission before we hear it\nUh you you let artistic which and then they want it to to sing about re enter Joey as a first nations may T Canadian active as taking on the first amendment\nYeah I mean the first amendment is is is obviously it's like freedom of speech right freedom of religion freedom of assembly freedom to petition the government a it's maybe the most uniquely American thing in the constitution um\nA lot of the artists that contributed to this album\nOr sort of honor the amendments but also sort of gave voice to the places where the amendment didn't protect people didn't help people are where we have a protection but it doesn't somehow get realized enjoy styles is one of the artist who sort of highlighted where the amendments have failed us a he's a first nations native Canadian\nAnd talked about how a under the first amendment up and threw the sixties Native American ceremonies were not protected and they were outlawed and in many cases there was a lot of violence connected with that and that's what he sings about here is what he did [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] was was out on my own\nSense of just by Georgetown interpretation of the first amendment ties twenty seventh emotion perfect album I'm here with ... and he\nIs the creator and host of more perfect and their third season is sort of anchored I guess that is albums that fair to say yeah so how First Amendment\nE did you get with making making the album linked to the artist have total free free rein did you did you get any submission fact that you were like you know what I'm not sure if you can say that\nNo we didn't get anything where people went sort of outside the bounds or like where we have to fact check people out of the project yeah but uh no we we sort of let people decide whether to directly address the ... amendment like I'm just a jump or for a second Dolly Parton a nineties amendment\nShe talked explicitly about the history explicitly about what it is and so that felt very much like a history lesson in inside of a song but in many cases people take it and they make it about relationships they making about\nPersonal experience they make it about something that's very very small and human scaled and not giant an ethic and I love that too cause that to me is as much the point is teaching it's about showing that these things matter that these things are alive and uh and with us\nYou know you mentioned Dolly Parton I had such an emotional\nReaction to Dolly Parton a contribution to for first of all I mean\nThat's a huge seemed to have associated with the project what was your reaction when you heard back from Dolly but she was interested in contributing a song\nI was like I have to make a concession or I might ... the only reason the deli part of this is because she's a good friends with my dad\nI can explain that to you have no idea how that happened did you know that your whole life or did you discover that like it's just going back about two years I discovered that he had sort of intersected with her uh and they got to be friends and\nWhen we decided to do this project I was like oh my God I got to ask Dolly through my dad so you know\nYou use what you can in this business and uh but yeah so at the end of the day Dolly Parton degree to do a song and\nIt's amazing it's an amazing song like that just a production values it's like it's like a it's like a musical theater meat pop anthem meets Dolly Parton or ... it all together it's it's amazing
