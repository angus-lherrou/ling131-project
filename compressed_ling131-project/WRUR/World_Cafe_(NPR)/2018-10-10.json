writing\nI usually right you know in my journal and I put it in my desk and I locked my desk because I don't want anybody to see the things in progress because it's embarrassing and terrible\nAnd um it takes me a long time to get the word to where I feel like they're pretty good you know and I'm In the closet I had limited amount of space you know trying to dig out all the journals and sort through stuff was taking up a lot of\nYou know real estate in the four of my closet so I started taping everything to the walls in there and it started exiting my closet and things are getting taped to the bathroom walls and then it would go further into my bedroom and be taped on the wall everything in it I'm\nSort of infant stages and um that was something I got used to try and do accept the process and the way that I Do things because having them out\nUm visible to my husband observation why it was terrifying and told him not to make any comments on my songs until I was done with him and wanted to comment and he went by the rules so that's how it happened\nUm I read that you were also talking to John Prine while you're writing your new record to the sunset I'm about songwriting I guess and I'm Wondering what sort of it he's one of the greatest what advice did he give you about songwriting\nOh I mean let me think where it started I don't even know what we were first started we were overseas last year and um\nHe was also writing and um we're on a plane and I was telling them about you because he asked if I had a broader rhyming dictionary and I said I Do it to my suitcase underneath the plane in them wherever the hold\nAnd uh but I Do have this app on my phone that is really helpful for rhyming and um then he got to ask [laughter]\nAnd then we talked about rhyming and then we were show in each other our rhymes and he was he was he's really good\nAt it um advise on how to make sure you put you know details and the songs and\nIn some things that that are universal to everyone like you do the things you see on the daily like a coffee cup or you know yeah I wasn't surprised to um\nWell you're you're a tremendous writer to to begin with but it really shows that influence really shows that for me on the song break out the champagne were after having listened to it once there are pictures that are left in my mind of\nOf things that you describe like there's there's that there's that magical thing where there's a bigger idea I guess like reminding making a choice in the face of of doom and gloom and then I'll ... he's really particular tiny pictures that you paint that I think are particular maybe\nDo you and your experience so before we play it can you can you tell me about were a couple of days and yet in this song come from somewhere [noise]\nOne of the lyrics somewhere above the new Finland see the pilots said we left an engine innocent lives second they made an executive decision said break up of champagne to that happen\nYeah that happened oh well except for the part about where I said break out the champagne what happened is I was on a flight that was headed from Dulles to London and um the plane you know one of the engines failed in um\nThe pilots said we lost at engine you know and and um all the power went out and all this stuff and the a flight attendant took away my drink I Am in preparation for our landing which I didn't see as something that was necessary to do in this situation\nUm 'cause I was really just like no please don't do that that's the worst thing you can do but I let 'em have it because what if I Would have got arrested on my what could have been my last five minutes on earth I don't know I wasn't thinking clearly\nSo in my mind I rewrote it um if it would have happened again I Would have just gotten up and ... because it was so quiet when all this was happening or turning around and landing in I'm In my mind I thought it would have been a much more fun experience I had somebody just broke out the champagne and started passing it around and then\nYou know living in the moment instead of waiting for your\nUh you know possible impending doom oh yeah so ... possible impending\nWe're ready to go there but you know what I meant yeah in a sense of sense of impending disaster I guess yeah there you go yeah well let's let's hear from the San ...\nBreak out the champagne [laughter]\n[noise]

to load in\nAny ... any set up the player show you pack all your stuff back into them and then you drive you know you might get home it to your hotel at two AM and unload the stuff and then you go to your hotel room sleep there for hours it's the same thing every day it's so monotonous and\nAn exhausting and you get really tired and then you're still driving while you're tired and your friends are helping you drive and then the day you're trying to take take shift sleeping to having the bus is like you get in the bus\nYou write down the road during the night you wake up in a town you get to walk around and experience to place\nLoad in sound check do your show afterwards you put your stuff on the bus you can go you know have some dinner with your friends get back on the bus go to sleep

way that you parent how that affects\nThis innocent person that that life is shaped on which you know it is it nature versus nurture question but part of it is what you do affect the outcome of this

S. Finger Lakes public radio all across the region there's a number of other sites and let's just at the last two on the list before we go because it's already one fifty three\nAll right so also on the list of five to revive let's go out to Seneca county the town of Seneca Falls the former nationally east company an era ... motor car factory Caitlin my this tell us about that one\nYes so it's it's a three story brick industrial building with great character big airy windows that would make perfect space for you know mixed use artist studios residential office\nYou name it um and it's\nRight on the five and twenty court or just outside of downtown Seneca Falls so it's an important historic court or in the community the current proposal is that the owner would like to to demolish it so that I'm In other gas station slash convenience store can be constructed in its\nPlace another one of those yeah okay and how far along are we in ... in terms of that kind of development\nSo I the the owner has been working with the town of Seneca Falls to get permission to demolish the property I'm so at this point and the owners and working through the towns um preservation board\nSo that process how ... they they the board denied demolition I Believe but you know the owners still trying to appeal that process we're working to try and see if we can get a developer hooked up to present an alternative yeah I mean I can\nUnderstand putting gas stations were in places where there are none like Henrietta but for a place like Seneca Falls I mean it's a historic site there um I guess we'll see so that's one to follow um are you optimistic on that when Kim\nThat's now that's one that can really go either way\nOkay yeah I'm fifty fifty on that one last one unless there's a village of highly down or out in Orleans county ... fellows hall what is odd fellows hall\nSo this is just a this is right in the center of downtown highly which we've worked on within the past but the highly high school it's now in a better track and this is really the the largest kind of anchor corner building and the downtown commercial core that was originally than Ansel is how it's been vacant for a number of years\nThe village um wants there a local development corporation to be able to take ownership of it is currently owned by an out of state owner who bought it for like five hundred dollars on an online auction\nSo those often aren't the best property owners so I'm the village is working to get control of the property it's a you know got some bricks that are falling off of that but I'm I'm optimistic on that one if we can help the village out because on a better path\nAnd Evan this is a great example where we're proud that the five to revive is that catalytic influence so highly high school which is located not far from the site is currently in in construction and our five to revive committee specifically solve this resource as an opportunity to build upon the success of\n... I think it's so interesting about looking at the list that you guys put together for years it's not just in what you would call sorting historic Rochester city neighborhoods you gone to suburbs you go into villages you go all across the region and um that's something that they've been doing every year\nPenn Yan cat or August county ... go far and wide and you can see what they are have put together for this year's list at landmark society dot org and in past years list so Rochester's aqueduct is on the list the Colgate Rochester ... divinity school campus\nThe former national east company in ... motor car factory\nOdd fellows hall in Holly and parrot hall\nIn the city of Geneva and this will be very interesting a year from now\nTo see the state of the year ...

Rochester\nBichon ... edition of the world cafe today Talia talks to Frank Turner so\nAlbum is called the more kind there's not going to save the well the idea would be more inclined to some kind of ... it's not bad for us to bring Turner's punk roots an energetic anthems also show up on the album be more kind so do some of his thoughts about the state of the world\n[noise] lying in the past\nRight has gotten flak from both the left and the right side of the political spectrum and at one point he received hate mail and even death threats\nI'd love to down here and be kind of a tough guy a punk until you I didn't care about the backlash that was generated by then but I did it was horrible Frank Turner coming up on the world cafe\nThis is such a cool conversation and Frank Turner is just one of my favorite a punk rock folk rocker is you know in the spirit of Billy bragging Talia really gets to the heart of that you'll hear that conversation in just a mother but let's get started\nChicken chicken shakes plenty rates on the cafe\n\nAgain show up in ... I\n\nDue to the\n[noise]\nIn trying to be more kind of I Love it I Love it no one had had it how how does that eh thing that you get to do or say well your audience I mean I I have spent\nA lot of my life wrestling my professional life I should say wrestling with this idea about whether or not I have any responsibilities as a role model or or whatever because first of all ... you know I grew up with a punk rock scene and and the things that attracted me most was the iconic caused them and the idea that it wasn't about\nKind of individuals on pedestals it was about a conversation between equals in ... punk rock music is supposed to be um I Know so you know my my ... my politics lean towards the ... or the libertarian I'm not really particularly keen on ... structures and I don't want to\nBut we'll do the center of my politics is not is wanting to not tell other people what to do\nHaving subtle that if I Am going to have people paying attention to what I say that I as I got older I suppose I've started thinking about that a little more and and um [noise] you know people have said that they work in this album is kind of domestic which is interesting because in ... in terms of its genesis is actually probably the most pessimistic records I've written\nBut I Will own up to the fact that I Would encourage all up to ... and I think the reason for that is that I just don't see the point if you're going to make a a normative statement than you might as well do try and do something constructive with it you know so\nRight so you do dabble in on in the popular a popular eat those I guess of political statements\nOn I guess yeah I mean is it reluctantly but yes I remember like it like if you got a song called make America great again yeah ... they're not as what's going on in businesses a faculty get hit by the way the east\nYou start that song you say well I Know I'm just in ... ignorant Englishman uh but I like to make America great again yeah why did you want to start a song with that ...\nI'm because that was the ... ripostes that people were going to have those like well you know from here sorry about my American I've seen several um you know I'm with the Muslim actually grow out of 'em and in fact called the ... I was on tour\nIn the states with our friends and plug in money in the summer twenty six team which is when everything's going really high wire in the election campaign and um and I sort of had this little ... I was saying about um\n'cause I I don't I don't care for the Clintons generally as a thing um but I ... in the same time during the campaign for the ... to the extent anyone's interest in my opinion about this and it just\nThe America that I Love I Love America passionately just struck me as ... in a kind of felt real estate agent who now plays of successful one on TV with the um feasible heck of\nA ... you know and I and I and it struck me as it is a\nRepresentation of of of America's sort of worst instincts and I would say this on stage in the immediate thing that would come back it'd be like well what what would you know your English um and on some of those I can see that point in their you know myself I get I get ... slightly innovated when people people can have ill informed opinions about for example the breaks a debate\nBut at the same time festival I spend the vast majority of my professional touring left in America and have done for a decade I'm I'm a complete politics not I I I've been to forty eight states now so you know I played in so I've got some kind of holistic view of the country\nI don't want people can hear and what you said in in picking out from characteristic them at the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and the cramping yeah I'll check I Want people to hear that as as at home and I can because I think what your take on the next song is if the principles and the idea that you see ten right\nI mean the thing that ... that was the discussion that the background for there's some there's some himself him really particularly about any individual and in fact\nTo go deep into the ... the first five seconds I I think that the sort of the um ... tendency is the American executives over the last sort of Fifteen twenty is is a collective problem on both sides of the ... I think that it would be wonderful if it meant to cost a lot less to the American president was\nBecause the system the the three bumps to the legislature and executive\nDid you just read what better balanced you know I think that would be a good thing um and and I think that that's a criticism\nThe ... as much as anyone is going to listen to what I have to say that applies across the boss he launched um you know I like to I just think it's a bit of a shame that we are in this kind of when it's cool situation where it's like\nMy God the president's so we're going to completely destroy our opponents for four years and then you go I guess I Would go and he's going to do the same thing\nAnd it's just like cool could we not just devolve power a little bit away from the center right so what did you want to see what the song\nWell the central thing about the song is that I feel that the people who have the expression\nMake America great game written on the ... have in my humble ignorant English opinion missed identified what is great about America unlike it brought you a long list of what's great about America if we have to ... towards the song is what that moment when your friends kind of\nLike Hammond in a bar and start shouting at the security guard and you go over and you just genuinely kind of have a whisker in there and be like\nMay chill out at school you know let's just go back to the table and just how to drive a glass of water\nUm some finishes with the lines you know it says um let's be a friend to our oldest friend and cooled them out when they're older and I'm not to me as part of loving America I'm wanting to be a friend to America is just putting your hand up when you think it's going the wrong way\nRight okay let's let's hear hatred that in some ... well\nI Know I'm being [noise] but I like to me\nAgain you'll\nGive my accent and\nYou know\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThat make America great again Frank Turner off his new album called beat more kind that is a rousing chorus yes and I would think that if people weren't listening really carefully to the words that you're saying and the rest of the core is um\nThey could miss and there's never yeah did you hear it like when I first heard the song I was like we were we were we were what's going on here yeah\nIt's kind of fun when I Am streets with lots of people who haven't heard it before because like I deliberately don't quite tell people what started the corn I'm coming down on\nAnd you can see some people's hospitals go way way up in the crowd but I'd I'd like to think that the law and about racism is reasonably prominent hopefully permanent enough to stable for Springsteen spell incident that I think that um remotely sort of on anyone's right over ... anyway\nBut um I I Know I Know what you're talking about I mean the born in the U.S I with the Reagan campaign or yeah or ... or ... I I seriously doubt that that's in my future\nYeah what I think is interesting is that you\nAh\nYou've gotten flak from from both sides of the ... I've gotten to the left and from the ... the right on\nThat made me feel like I was doing something right by the way when when when when uh 'cause I missed the ... people in the left on my flight from ... from the ... election out in the middle of ... maybe I'm doing something right well it's\nInteresting though because you haven't claim to speak to people from from any particular side I think the thing that you've been clear about is is the libertarian beliefs\nBut I mean I'm not even particularly comfortable about what actually as I get older because it seems what you were still ... to me\nI'm so in ... what we're ... in in twenty twelve a writer from the guardian collected among the political thing you you had said she was on and put them together in this article and and and you got death threats from your people on the left\nTell me how that works its way into the little things that\nUm well I guess I mean there's some changes um which is sort of that that's kind of the essential idea is it's like\nRather than um if you're talking about substance abuse for example rather than just kind of trying to do that thing of kind of going like ... or you know a an and then you be yourself and then if you if you trends grass then you you relapsed times ten because you hate yourself and you're just trying to prove that you're a\nLoser and all that sort of usual stuff that comes with addiction therapies instead of that it's just it's kind of like it's more forgiving but it's also just about the small things is just about kind of like deleting phone numbers from your phone or just like\nIf you get a certain kind of twitch in the ad and sort of taking yourself to a different borrow taking yourself harm or whatever you know it's an and I think that that's the thing is like if you might small changes that up to big changes if you set yourself season Samantha ... tusks\nThen you defeat yourself right from the white guy you know and I and actually that an as some hopefully demonstrates that applies to weigh more than just my own sort of personal foibles and it applies to I'm a to politics as well I think that if we change the way to go to suck all black and my God look at\nIt um it just took about two hours talking beginning if you know um if you say ask yourself the question how do we save all politics than most people are going to end up scratching their heads and having no I did\nBut you know how do we have a conversation with somebody who disagree with how do you um try and find\nSomething in common with somebody who vote for the other guy or whatever you know what I mean I'm the these are small things that you can do that might add up old wouldn't want my favorite ones and I try and do this and I'm so bad at it but I Try and do the whenever I'm having a dog um and I always try and consider the possibility that I'm the idiot\nLike first well begin with that well just to just try it you know and and and hopefully if you have any kind of like sort of coherence ... view you will reject that idea but it's worth just giving it a go Jenna mean before you start pounding the table just kind of got him either one he's kind of\nCompletely in a way out of my mind to 'em and and you know uh the the ability to say I've changed my mind from time to time or indeed to admit you don't quite know and you could do with reading more than the topic or whatever these are the little changes that we can try and try and make and I think they would add up to a more intelligent an adult discourse\nWhere we're going to go out on
