father emigrating from Mexico to the U.S into tales Ramallah Hondros punk rock that like your time is banned open for the Sex Pistols\nWhen the nuns were on stage you know people were throwing all kinds of money cameras all kinds of things it was a strange show it was the end the broad review of the first wave of one of\nThe sea tuned to find out if we throw anything if the banter that fact has our Hondros performs with San Antonio fly\nComing up on the world cafe\nWarming it up that's what tele aside and I'm stealing it right now which is why I Love it that's right\n[noise]\nYou're not going to [noise] man I\nThink you do you\nLook so nice and you'll have\n\nA\n\nThat's right that's right\n\nMy girls\nMommy down\nUnion now as we were driving\nYeah I mean the one\nAlways been\nThe uh the\nBe a threat to not\nYeah yesterday I told a friend that we'd be put together by a manager lack of boy band oh that's really low score logistical reasons are they under wasn't during in Europe where the food banks do you ... years and that just that my lifting shoulder record and then on the outdoor her direct ... there were some kind of a\nConnection between our we worked reaping\nThe kind of music to look into music from South let's see ... and that was something to put up together for a tour to blow supposed to be a one off\nAnd it became a friendship and a brother who'd they'll let the record\nAnd so you guys decide you want to do a record and to prepare for this record un Tony or spent time traveling around the deep south of America so this is what's happening to me\nYou're going to write a concept record about to immigrants in America interview a lifelong living in American American takes an Italian on a tour of the deep south\nAnd Tony what's surprised you about that trip\nOr you know first of all the way they were the other hand or give everything will be from feeling because I saw him being your emotional through my emotional lives you know they do the same when you bring people do we go there and watch the ... the places that are familiar to you through the rise and you're going to school for them the gym\nAnd you know the thing about ... on your came over it you know he\nLanded in Dallas texas you know which is pretty hard core America you know and uh we spent\nI don't know maybe a few weeks but the together and we would go driving around the country roads you know and there was also a lot of people in dollars that we spoke to who were dreamer in you know and so we spoke to them and got some of their stories and\nYou know a lot of their stories kind of made an impression on the song\nSo even though you know this area well going out with Antonio and showing him parts of America that the you know it seems like you took something away from the the experience as well we do\nIt you know when it's money well we're drug around in my pickup truck coming from Austin we took the back roads or we go through all the little known you know out in the country\nAnd I remember were drawn along and we both be talk in your jotting things down and maybe I was driving not come up with some imagery or lyric and I'm Renee would write it down and then\nHe would draw the dog and maybe not yeah we started running down like a you know have no idea that we eventually became the phone\nAll the hundreds debate over here along with done until they have a new record out it is it called the crossing 'em we would love to hear something will look for the first year in the world cafe or a\n[noise]\n\n\nThe law\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWe're on the world ... stay here with ... ... and Don I'm Tony up the new album is called the crossing it is a concept record involving two young men shall the NBA go and it is available now just get the ... back to a joined us here\nSo that they're showing something but what is it about writing sad songs were you talk\nAbout writing sat on the civil liberating\nI don't know you know that song really is about I think the just the feeling of\nDistance you know and now that can be done a devastating the Times' room\nAnd you're seeing all the things around the corner Bangor here many wonders will you know when I got myself into into running a melody running the song runny nose singing just someone far away\nI think we all do that from time to time you know walk around singing songs that reminders of certain times in our lives that were better maybe\nA hundred arrested they do or get here there was another\nOne on the album or that says I lost my innocence too I yeah I Know you were born in in San Antonio Texas but you ... your parents were immigrants yeah what what what was it like for then how did they see the experiences coming\nMy father was born in Nineteen oh seven you cross when he was twelve years old\nSo his his um\nAdversary was not ... but the Texas Rangers you know\nWho are very brutal and so he had just gave that kind of thing and make his way to San Antonio where we had relatives and then he was reunited with his parents and looming Texas but he was a twelve year old boy when he made the journey from self deal to San Antonio wow\nWow and I think we wanted to speak the language of\nHumans because sometimes when you talk about immigrants you know politicians speak the language of politics which is respectable buddies shoot I'll be from grammar any to propaganda you speak the language of ... which again can be respectable buddies from other language\nWhen you talk you know a man in the mail from another man you can only do the language or ... and that's why we try we try to do there are problems obviously there are issues that can be addressed that can be so many different ways\nBut when we're talking about your most rehab to speak the language of the ... and that's why we try to do\nI think that's why it's important to remember the songs on big or young\nInnocent dreamers right\nAnd so their journey is not to change the world necessarily but doing become part of something right and what they find is a sense of loss because the laws are homeland land that they love they love turns behind relatives beyond lovers beyond\nAnd what they find as a hostile country\nYeah in search of a better life when maybe that better like doesn't necessarily ... at the front door or we're here with all the hundred data and a dining tonia talking about the new album

Rochester\nYou're listening to the world cafe is ... and Richard Swift was able loved it\nSongwriter and producer in the NBC who work with machines and black tea\nYou and Damien Gerardo box which in the band your regular news just more the names go on and on he was truly a lot but this is from his costume his record the it's broken finger blues on World Cafe\nI\nYou're done and [noise]\nI\nLa\nA\n\n\n\nAnd when is it finished a you know how far do you want to go how much do you want to understand how much new ones do you want to have\nAnd uh you engage in that and that experience um somebody can sit and ah you know contemplate a\nYou know a sunset for over an hour or so or they can just see it for a second so really it has to do a do with that and um\nBut basically it is an experience and through that experience certain things evolve and they they they come into focus and you you engage realities you normally normally would not\nAnd um and that's kind of the uh the excitement of all of that uh I have no idea of where the ... what I'm capable of doing until I engage in that engagement um has its own evolutionary aspect about\nMine is Jessie says if he does if he's done six hundred bikes he he's done maybe one thing that he's sending off to a customer saying this feels John just feels like I've done everything that I wanted to do you generally more often than not say look constraint said this has to be done or more often than not are you saying this feels done I feel good about it I'm walking away it's finished\nA mile\nNo I I really don't I really don't see things that way it's um it's hard to explain\nYou don't think about things in the in the context of done\nIf you think about something done you oh you you have a a thought I'm ahead of time of what you want to accomplish\nIf you know what you want to accomplish ahead of time why even spend that time doing it because you're always know what the outcome is ah for me the the outcome is finding things that you don't know\nI have a good skill level will have a great experience but that does that that was really value is to me it's what I don't know and the process of working engages those realities and uh you explore things that you never never we come upon normally ...\nOr so in our last couple of minutes or Albert I was told by the some of the producers of W ... um you you felt pretty strongly that this should not only be a collaboration with with Jesse James but it also ought to be documented in a way that it was you could have done this without cameras why did you want a document\nWell I think this is very very important ah what Jesse experienced in his studio what I experienced in my studio it's a very a personal interaction we have a certain skill level we have machinery we have people that we deal with\nAh when people see a finished work\nThey can respond to it if they liked it or they don't like it or whatever but they don't understand the process\nWith pure documentation I think that this is a window into that reality than other people can see is a very very rare\nThat commitment that W ... had to bring this to fruition to be able to show that is a very very unique thing and um because because of this uniqueness that would have been lost otherwise and so therefore it is the documentation I think is extremely important\nAlright about a minute left Jesse what are you looking for when you watch this document I mean you've gone through the process you're you're in it but what what do you what are you most eager to see in the ...\nI think you I think for me it was like taking a risk you know stepping out of my comfort zone where I Know I could build a bike or a car or a gun or something that's gonna\nYou know people are going to appreciate I think taking a risk we're like okay now I'm doing art which I you know ... we took him to fat check some of the comments and those people like what the hell's that\nThing to do [laughter] that land there you know like so it's like kind of you know\nYeah but that's just that's just the point that got them thinking about things I never thought about before so that's the validity\nOf I I think I Would I'm looking for is\nTo be appreciated in a similar venue that Albert and you know that's what I'm looking for\nWell Jesse thanks for taking the time for the program today and we will see you in Rochester eight days from now on a friday the twenty sixth thank you so much\nYet see you guys\nTook their and Jesse James is going to be here with Albert Paley\nThe documentary WRX excise original
