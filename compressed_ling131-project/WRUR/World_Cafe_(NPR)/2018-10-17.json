certificates in some cases and that's that's a strong combination\nI think ultimately be good to move more away from the blood quantum and and because that pushes us down that DNA path and I don't like the DNA path\nFor the K Ron girl well I also don't like the um DNA path and I also don't agree with the uh I was being\nRegistered by the tribe in that sort of thing because there was a time in this world where a women had to go off into the forest and have children by themselves and they were not documented\nOf these children because the United states government would come and take these children away and put them in residential boarding schools and parents wouldn't see them\nSo these children were never put on the rules and they have um Native American lineage and but they just can't prove it so where are we to tell these people whose um grandparents were in great grandparents were brave enough to go off and\nHave these children without um any assistance off in the forest and you know tell them that they're not native because they are ... professor Robert\n... native nations are allowed to determine their own membership some used blood quantum some down there's problems with blood quantum is a ... of using a fraction it it's it it it can never increase it will always decrease over time as as as as\nPeople meet other people and so on tribes do have to have barriers and in many tribes have membership offices because they are flooded by people who want to claim native identity and an end amongst those who claim that identity are\nPeople legitimately reconnecting to to their heritage but also Charlotte and posters and wannabes who who for various reasons want to get in on a ... into a tribe because they feel they're certain benefits that may accrue to them for that reason [noise]\nUm so the the answer to the caller is is no no you you don't get the ... we we can't claim anything we want native nations are are are have very good sense of who belongs and who doesn't and they have means on their own for deciding who belongs in and who\nDoesn't have an outside of native contacts so by the cultural context and racial context yeah I mean look ... [laughter]\nYeah I mean my my kids they're going to make a choice at some point right now and ah that that's going to be up to them to the side it'll be up to the broader society in some sense to see how how it's how it's construed and how how convincing it is down the road\nUm look\n[laughter] what what I think we see is is in in questions like the the the color the email is that notion that that white people are are claiming other things Rachel ... also\nLike a crazy example I'm ... and I I don't know that all that much about her story\nUm [laughter] it's I think it's ... it's just so\nProblematic um these these these identity issues when it comes to\nWhite people deciding who who gets to be what [noise]\nUm and so the last word of the hour goes to Jordan to be on the line go ahead Jordan\nYeah I a political them scares me um because it's something that you know I'm In close to being thirty and I'm starting to think about what's my future going to look like if I have children and I'm\nLittle scared like if I have kids do I get to tell them that they're ... or do I have to say like I Am but you're not do they have to tell their kids that it's a really it\nMakes sense on a very large political social scale when you're looking at it from distance but when you get down to the individual there is at one point going to be that line that says I'm Sorry you can't be native ... and even though your\nFather or your mother and I don't know if I have a good solution for that because\nIn the ... by racial so often because it more accurately described who I Am I'm but also when we had these really hard line to basically say you can't be this or that are based on something like blood bought them it\nRaises a lot of question um which is why oftentimes I tell people that are being Native American is more about your cultural involvement and your ability to like\nConnected be involved with the culture and the experience that you had when you were growing up um there is a political aspect to it which involves being on the rolls and you know having that tribal members ship\n'em but otherwise [noise]\nAnd like that's a very different thing but otherwise yeah\n[laughter] well Roger in Jordan to be we appreciate your perspective father and son one studio one in the west coast thanks for taking the time to vote for you\nJordan you've already welcome yeah no thank you Roger and our thanks to run Darrow\nMicrosoft's new mohawk ... and the cultural ... surge rock\nYeah go on why thank you run appreciate that and Romney pollock member Mississauga is at the new credit first nation eagle planned executive director of the Native American cultural center and host of canoes running pilot always nice to have you back next weekend and wake up our thanks to professor Michael Bloomberg\nWho had to split our thanks to the engineer Jon Andrus producer mega Mac I met a dusting lovely afternoon to\nTalk to you tomorrow a new member supportive public radio [noise]\n\n\n\nThis program as a production of W ... public radio the views expressed you're not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters\nThe broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without expressed written consent of W ... by your strictly prohibited connections with ...

Rochester\n[noise] hey you're listening to the world cafe I'm Calais open for ... today we talk to my old friend ... ... you're the story of the crossing his new concept album with the Taliban composer Don Antonio and he's been\nThe cautious tells the story of two immigrant boys one from Mexico and the other from Italy traveling around the United states ... will tell the story of his father emigrating from Mexico to the U.S into tales from Allah Hondros punk rock day like your time is banned open for the Sex Pistols\nWhen the nuns were on stage you know people were throwing all kinds of money cameras on [noise] it was a strange show it was the end of punk rockers we knew it was the first wave of both\nWorlds really shakes you to find out if we throw anything into band today vaccinating\nHas ... performs with San Antonio fly coming up on World Cafe\nWarming it up that's what tele aside and I'm stealing it right now which is why I Love it that's right [noise]\n\n\nYou're on a on a man if I\nYou will you'll\nLose so many ways you\n\n\nI'm a\nWell mush\nBill mind ...\nMommy down and\nJam or do you mean dragging\nShe asked me in the same\nHe'll always looming\nThe uh the\nEnough\nYeah yesterday I told a friend that we've been put together by a manager like a boy band out actually it was more logistical reasons are they on that it wasn't during in Europe where the food ... to ... years and I just add my let's say solar record and then on the ... heard the record NFL there were some kind of a\nConnection between our we worked reaping\nThe kind of music to look into music from South let's say ... and that was something that put us together for a Tour de Paul supposed to be a one off\nAnd it became a friendship and a brother who would that lead to the record\nAnd so you guys decide you want to do a record and to prepare for this record you and Antonio spent time traveling around the deep south of America so this is what's fascinating to me\nYou're going to write a concept record about to immigrants in America and so you a life long living in American American takes an Italian on a tour of the deep south\nAntonio what surprised you about that trip\nOr you know first of all the way they were the other hand or give everything a different feeling because I saw him a being emotional through my emotional lives you know and these are saying when you bring people to eat the any watching the ... the places that are familiar to you through their eyes and you're going to discover them again\nAnd you know the thing about ... on your came over to the you know he\nLanded in Dallas texas you know which is pretty hard core America you know and uh we spent\nI don't know maybe a few weeks I think together and we would go driving around the country roads you know and there was also a lot of people in Dallas that we spoke to who were dreamers you know and so we spoke to them and got some of their stories and\nYou know and a lot of their stories kind of made an impression on the song\nSo even though you know this area well going out with Antonio and showing him parts of America that that you know it seems like you took something away from this this experience as well we\nDid you know and it's funny what we were drug around in my pickup truck coming from Austin we took the back roads or we go through all these little towns you know out in the country\nAnd I remember we drive along and we both be talking just Johnny things down and maybe I was driving not come up with some imagery or lyric and onto a new would write it down and then\nHe would drive and we talk and maybe you had an idea we started to write it down like a you know having the ideas that we eventually became these songs\nAll the hunter s debate over this year alone with San Antonio they have a new record out it is it called the crushing um we would love to hear something blue note for the first year this in the world cafe or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're on World Cafe here with ... and Don I'm Tony oh the new album is called the crossing it is a concept record involving two young men shell the NBA go and it is available now just joking ... back to a joined us here\nSo that that's wrong something but what is it about writing sad songs where you talk\nAbout writing sat on the civil liberating\nI don't know you know in that song really is about I think a just a feeling of\nDistance you know and now that can be done the devastating the Times' room\nAnd you're seeing all the things around them that are kind of Bangor here many wonders will you know whatever I got myself into into running a melody running the song running you know seeing just someone far away\nI think we all do that from time to time you know walk around singing songs to remind us of certain times in our lives that were better maybe\nA hundred arrests debate to adjust here there was another line on the album or that says I lost my innocence to ice yeah I Know you were born in in San Antonio Texas but your and your parents were immigrants yeah what what what was it like for then how did they see the experiences coming\nWhen my father was born in Nineteen Seventy cross when he was twelve years old so his his um\nAdversary would not ... but the Texas Rangers you know\nWho are very brutal and so he had just good luck on this thing and make his way to San Antonio where we are relatives and then he was reunited with his parents the looming Texas but he was a twelve year old boy when he made the journey from still deal to San Antonio wow well\nAnd I think we wanted to speak the language of\nHumans because sometimes when you talk about immigrants no politician speak the language of politics which is respectable buddies to be from grammar any to propaganda you speak the language of rubber ... which again can be respectable buddy so now there are language\nWhen your book you know a man in the mail from another man you can only do the language or ... and that's why we try we try to do there are problems obviously there are issues that can be addressed that can be so many different ways\nBut when we're talking about your most rip to speak the language of the ... and that's what we try to do\nI think that's why it's important to remember the songs on big or young innocent dreamer right\nAnd so their journey is not to change the world necessarily but doing become part of something right and what they find is the sense of loss because the laws are homeland land that they love they love turns behind relatives beyond lovers beyond\nAnd what they find as a hostile country\nYeah in search of a better life where maybe that that are like doesn't necessarily ... at the front door or we're here with all under the data and are done Antonio talking about the new album the crossing a but up next a we would love to hear one of the songs to one of the first single from the album or would you be so kind to place sonic could usa for us for your\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] I think the room just got about ten degrees Taj here on the ... cat back all of my job at\nGetting paid out here in Studio ... along with Don Tony or the new
