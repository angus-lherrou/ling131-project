opportunity to participate in our economy and get a job\nAnd as I mentioned it's been a real change in the way we do these job fairs only people only companies that actually have jobs available\nAnd we also we work with our department of Human Services as well or to help folks who are looking for a job a match in advance with companies that are coming to the job fairs in areas where people actually live so that folks can access employment um and can participate in our economy\nDone to our last two minutes Dave next on the phone got to keep a tight Dave go ahead Hi Dave\nBoth a that's a
