I think at least at the decision to make the album came in large part from time spent on tour with the imposter as when you're playing lots of songs from your album imperial bedroom from Nineteen eighty to\nA drive that right\n[noise] I I Would say that but that was really what kept me over I'd been thinking about whether that was a moment we could go back to the studio I really felt the wasn't ... showed the range of things with the group could do but\nI could point to particular shows we played where we go to incorporate all the different elements of the band\nBut we were often just called on to be kind of a rock and roll my which we do pretty well but er we got lots of different songs particularly the ones written over the last Fifteen to Twenty years\nAnd they spend complete the mole and you know when you think about it I've I've driven them down different roads and and say okay we're off to Mississippi to make this record what we went to New Orleans without to solve\nThese are experiences you wouldn't trade ... but we had never sat down with the intention of making a record where we had all the scope we could wishful\nAnd we have to prepare Robert differently than we did with him in payroll bedroom but we weren't trying to do a re creation of law do you need you to record we just we were treating it like a stock of songs that some of which we performed since the beginning of this mountain in two thousand and two\nUm would you pick his son from imperial bedroom from from Nineteen eighty two that I felt really good to to play on tour that we could just get in our heads\nAs part of the springboard of inspiration for then you remember\nI Wish I had a meeting the the the one that would really come to mind was just before bedtime yeah\nBut because the but the recording of it doesn't do doesn't tell you anything about the story that was in the song really it's a much it's the the feeling of the song of the lyric is much closer to some of the\nSome of the songs like stripping ... much bleaker song than than they'd rather joining the way we arranged it but it would really pick one that I think is is closer and in in ... tipping the way it would be kid about it oh is that when you\nWrite about the day that John Lennon got shot yeah\nWell I wrote it that day or you don't really strictly speaking about that but I think it I think the song also contain this melancholy because it was just happened to be written that day it happened to be written the pay and where and then she\nHad to be a very big day for you um what do you remember where you where\nI was a home you know it was a homing on the\nUh I guess the news came in overnight awoke up to a I remember calling Pete up and said let's just go for you know we read up at a pub on the river and\nJust talk about you know everything that a fish they smile and men you couldn't find a mate you know that those sort of things didn't happen to people in popular entertainment you know they\nThey happened to politicians sometimes that didn't happen to people who didn't seem to prefer be provoking anybody particularly you know so yeah of course is my primary but he was a horrible thing but most most especially for his family you know\nLet's let's listen to some of the kid about it from imperial that you\nA\nZ is a [noise]\nShe's\nA little bit of a\n[noise]\n[noise] but then when I was just a problem\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n...\nAnd then\nNext kid about it often Nineteen eighties I'm Sheryl edging Elvis Costello that fuels or data on all this back\nOn TALK All right yeah I I hear that it's been pretty eccentric now but when we do you know because I Would have to have this idea that I should somehow disguise my own voice rather than just get other people to sing the other ...\nSo I'm singing with all sorts of different vocal inflection you know kind of I don't know why it was doing that but it was that's the way I heard that and so when we came to perform the same song often the way the launch handed over to another sound in the middle of the phrase\nThat was actually done with the other thing is and I kind of made more logical sense I mean there's some there's some definitely willful idea going on with this recording and I love it\nBut when you sing it in a lot of performance and not weigh in a more\nA strictly speaking conventional Coleman response way it's it's a different kind of power and the and that's what I think we hear a law in in where we had back and forth between the lead voice in the background group in in a lot of the arrangement some on look now\nYeah a Elvis Costello is my guest here on World Cafe anything record is called look now are there a few songs on the record at least that we're co written with Bert backtrack a beloved\nBird yeah but I had a pretty good thing to say I like the way that child [laughter]\nYeah I suppose I like the way that the song sound so so first of all before we hear what you and Bert worked on together can you pick a song of his that that you really love and maybe tell me why\nOh my goodness yeah um I Would you know I'm going to pick one and it's called walk little doggy too\nAnd it says it is only in real life does go house to cry and it talks about a girl going back in her room and imagining a childhood\nUm but this is like the ... been sort of shots or by you know adult concerns\nAnd it's just an amazing piece of music I mean\nSome of those songs are they just they just have so much turmoil in the ... I don't think people really appreciate what what it is he did so\nThere's millions of great songs that not millions but hundreds of songs but road I'm from ... combined to what will always love to our feet that you could quote but this one's not known so much\nWell let's hear a Dionne Warwick on getting a version of at that time I Walk a little Dolly\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThat's\nThat we should go I'm not going to I I don't often get out and given the choice so I'm going to pick one from the new album because we play predominantly ballads pleased and this ... below the conversation which I Do thank you for the time we play one I think is a little bit of a cold\nA cold to the policy oh yeah which is which is a song about them you know it's still going a little little shadow and it it's about the nightmare having a dream nightmare dream of about a job was seen as cool Mr Mrs harsh we [noise]\nWe'll go out on that and Elvis they want to say thank you so much for talking today and that and congratulations on the new album thank you a great pleasure [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou\n\nWant to\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDon't\nBridge in\nNew York\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n...

Rochester\nHey we'll come back to World Cafe until years later when the band Sylvan as so really there some radio a lot of people ask\nThink there needs to be some sort of cultural component of getting people used to taking public transit in Rochester\nThat's another part of the organic conversation just into the expectation that cars cars everywhere you know ... yeah\nWell you have to be also very clever on how you design your spaces in places in the city um for instance the riverside hotel right now has its main driveway entrance right along the river and hopefully when they read do that and come up with a you know the plan is that that particular\nPart of the court or will be allocated towards the pedestrian and the automobile will be let's say come in from St Paul or maybe even further down main street but it has to focus on the pedestrian and so\nI was I was just I mean this is I'm sort of a historical note\nHere but I think it was about Nineteen fifty five give or take a few years\nRG and he actually created a promotional video for the city of Rochester which is something that I show my students and it's called Rochester city of quality um and it's about a twenty eight minute promotional video for the city showing midtown I'm showing showing you know it kind of typical suburban setting\nAnd they spent about these thirty minutes they spend about maybe seven talking about cars and parking um are going you know new parking lots downtown and ah how great they are and um you really when you see something like that you sent really\nHow deep that Carlos or nothing from the Nineteen fifties yes and and I want to be really clear about this we don't really need to do anything to give anybody better automobile access to Rochester New York writes let's be clear right because right now we have over fifty percent of the land in downtown Rochester is\nParking we don't have a parking problem so come on down\nAnd park your car and get out there and walk around the city in fact maybe you do like a tour of parking lots we could do it yeah we have all the doors and the oh my gosh you know every time you go downtown park in a different lot enough with the parking we don't get a parking problem\nEnough enough enough because too many cars are already All right let me push back a little than being our last couple of minutes and say Howard do you have\nAn apple parking but not parking well situated to where people go now you don't believe that absolutely it may not be in the right place it's also true that\nYou own the parking lot in my lane owns a parking lot and Peter on the parking lot and Roger owns a parking lot an hour and on the parking lot and are all these parking spaces coordinated with one another or they managed in a as a kind of collective parking assets\nNo so of course we don't know how to take advantage of what's here because we don't talk to one another about the parking assets that are in front of us I Believe I'm Sorry no no I just I was good I could go on for many many of these rust\nBelt cities and I'll throw out like Milwaukee and in Columbus and others are in in order to uh take the curse off of the car have instituted circulated are systems that go around the city and pick off\nAnd stop at a all sorts of destination places the hotels the the museums etcetera etcetera and that sort of takes the need if you will of having a cars in the center city\nAway people will ride to circulate as opposed to you know the auto\nAre down in the last minute to Peter Christians and you're given a lot to think about you're the one who's going to be moderating the panel discussion tonight a roundtable on rust belt urbanism starting at five PM at the University of Rochester and they'd love to see you there for that\nI actually emerged from this kind of optimistic I I have to be honest with you because there's a lot of challenges that so called rust belt cities have but it does sound like I think the problems have been probably pretty well diagnosed and defined\nAnd there are a lot of challenges but are you an optimist when you look around at different cities and the challenges they have\nI certainly am an optimist because I think rust belt cities present 'em\n... tremendous difficulties but also tremendous opportunities um I think the one\nThing that I um maybe less optimistic about or are nervous about are skeptical about is um when successes overstated um and I think that in a in a city like a buffalo I often feel the successes\nOver something about uh about revitalization revitalization okay okay so keep our realistic has just you know keep keep some critical distance from from the uh [noise] a narrative have a great discussion tonight I Am thanks for taking time to
