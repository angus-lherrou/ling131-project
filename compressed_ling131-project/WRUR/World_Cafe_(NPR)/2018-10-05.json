letters\nTo be my space um\nIt's very unconventional you can you describe it well it's I'm I'm about to twelve years ago maybe I bought an old place in the Berkshires um it was a summer house or the first US ambassador to Russia [noise]\nUm this is just sort of a sprawling older state in it'd been neglected at an empty since Nineteen sixty [noise]\nUm [noise] and ah you know just crumbling plaster crumbling fireplaces and it was beautiful some amazing um [noise]\nBut um [noise] uh you know over the years it's been completely very carefully historically restored\nAnd there's a massive great room in in the house it's just it's it's like a barn but it's all it's the size of a barn but it's you know you just walk through this little door and all of a sudden you're in this massive room fourteen foot windows all down the south side looking cross the field in the mountains [noise]\nUm it's all part of the house but it's ... it disappears really quickly I didn't want to look at work you know I just wanted the studio to be invisible so you wouldn't really know what's there until stuff is all set up everything she didn't and tucked away but it's so beautiful and it's really beautiful soulful like all the time\nIt sounds amazing and I should say well we're talking we're talking on backstage before a show that you have to make those people are hearing little soundtrack during their that's what's going on and tell me about um I guess the process\nOf editing and knowing it sounds like if you if you if you go into the studio with this vision and knowing having things pretty much complete before you start the recording process that maybe decision making along the way it wouldn't be a difficult but I imagine that with any creative process that you're\nProducing there are those moments where you're like Wayne something done who's layer and it's very it's intense though how I mean at the stressful it pleasant to live ...\nWho's just challenging and it's intense and yeah\nI'm I'm always\nThey took to allow imperfections in there if the overall um if emotionally it's working ... you know if the song feels like it's working emotionally\nAnd there are things in it that are in perfect\nI I Would rather take that than to try to you know make everything perfect but then it doesn't work emotionally yeah but it's always you know you always second guess yourself I mean everything I've ever done I always my second guess things here and there you know yeah but this but it's just\nIt's just like painting I just I just I painted and then I I look at it for a minute and if it feels like oh that's what I needed to express and then is the end of it for me\nIt's gone huh one of my mind I'm thinking about something else now you know I'm already thinking about different\nThings and um it's just a painting it doesn't doesn't mean anything I don't even the ... I don't even think music means anything to anybody anymore you don't I don't think so\nSome amount but I don't um I don't [noise]\nMusic for me is is uh is uh just the most beautiful form of just a just an art form I just love 'em but it feels like the appreciation for the subtle arts or um is waning [noise] sadly\nSo it's interesting to hear you say that could lead experience that I had\nWith your with your album is it like what you do is sort of feels like a protest almost against that because it does like to listen to part of a light [noise] um I Do we have to lean in and sit and pay attention and lesson from beginning to end and and rewarded for that\nSo it's really interesting like what um [noise] if if the way that you feel like people the fears of music is changing does that change the way that you approach making it like are you laughing\nWhen I don't make music for anybody else but myself ... it's like painting it's just that's how I express myself as well I'm just doing it for for me I mean the fact that I have a career as of this just [noise] I don't know\nI'm I'm happy that that music the music that I've made as made its way into people's lives\nI'm very thankful that I can assure you know you make a living and I'm not I'm knocking that believe me but I've also busted my ass uh you know I've been busted my eye since I was Fifteen Years old\nYou know the school bus would drop me off at the grocery store at a at a job at the grocery store Fifteen ... you know if this is just in my whole life has been like that and I'm like I don't I don't make I don't make music because I Want somebody just to tell me that they like my music\nRight I'm just thinking about like the act of what we're sitting and doing right now like if if you make and create and write for a place of expressing for yourself I wrestle with this all the time is somebody who is it that ask people questions about the art for a living like is there [laughter]\nThis is where it feels like a really weird thing to say but is there a value to talking about it or is it best experience just as it is\nUm you mean art in general yeah um [noise] well of course you should talk about it I guess yeah yeah you should talk about it sure\nOkay [laughter] good [laughter] I'm listening to piece of music from from the record that you recorded last I left it to hear your performance as such a simple thing to ...\n... ...

be\nTo even\n\nI mean they they made in\nI have to hide it away I think that if you're like yeah exactly so that they're like I'm Out there to have some fun too so\nThat's where I kind of want to go and the director of ... as we get ready for the last few minutes of this hour is how that cultural shift happened to be certainly people like Dr with have greatly helped whether it's in conversation education et cetera but we still I mean I haven't been in high school in many years but\nI talked to a high school students I've got family members I have a friends with kids that age and we still have a culture where boys are kind of grown up talking to each other in the lunchroom the way I used to here which is you know get some it's something to go get and for girls being told don't give it up you know withhold it's shameful\nI and I think that's a cultural shift is supposed to happen I absolutely\nWhen someone was talking earlier about educating um children about pleasure and an educated and gender equality and other countries I think that's where it starts if you're if we are equal in our abilities to pursue pleasure to pursue sex if we're we're encouraged to be equal as as young girls [noise]\nThen then it's not about a he makes the decision I give it up or I don't give up you know that he pursues\nWomen and I maybe I'm not in high school either anymore but maybe young women are are being more sexually uh aggressive or assertive of their own needs now and being able to say yes I have the desire and it's okay for me to pursue it\nAbsolutely I think that's so important I this is how adults play together\nIt should be something that we're there we're doing together not that ah somebody gets from somebody or a somebody has to give up um it's play it's a it should be it should be a team that were on together not a teams that are uh at opposing sides how do we get\nThere though I mean what are the steps that you still need to be taken to where the cultural change where at least that's more of the norm as opposed to this you know dynamic that we see\nDo we have another three hours or so uh well I I oh boy I think uh you know I think talking about it I I think not a taboo now making a taboo shame sexual shame is\nUm [noise] uh is is is a scored ... it's it's just a really dangerous for people to to feel a alone and ashamed about a themselves they're pleasure their attractions it's um\nAnd and I think if we can get rid of that shame I if we can help people understand that ah the sexual spectrum is its vast um that the spectrum of everything is vast and that diversity is to be valued and\nI'm embraced and a celebrated um that is a and shame can be banished ah that's our first step to getting back to a place where um we're just playing together\nIs there a connection with a culture that doesn't view things the way that you I just the idea was to sort of just in vision for us to have sort of a stunted idea of withhold et cetera is there a connection to kind of a broken culture on that and sexual violence\nUh yeah [laughter] yeah I think I I mean any where it's ah where it's\nA um [noise] uh where sex as a commodity um that needs to be stolen um where it can take in uh is is a part of the it's also that's a part of the power dynamic too I mean so much of sexual some of sexual violence is about sex\nBut most of sexual violence is about power and\nUm that swear stealing and uh um and and disrespect of uh the people involved a gets activated\nAnd we have we have you guys as as counsellors we have books we have all kinds of information that's out there but I think a lot of people get there early information from movies and television and I think we haven't seen a shift in recent years about where the power plays three men and women in\nThose types of programs will I think you're going to see a sounds like you're gonna see objects to the center stage the biography of the story of becoming Dr ruth of someone who's been central to the evolution of this conversation in the way we talked about sex or we talk about respect pleasure and love and I hope you enjoy\nBeing doctors you become a doctor at
