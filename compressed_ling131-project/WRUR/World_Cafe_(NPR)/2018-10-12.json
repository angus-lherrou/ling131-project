I'm going to give me I'm going to give you an example of Hillary Clinton said that to black lives matter organizers in Boston during the campaign she said we all want rights for everyone but what we what is your agenda what is the ... of course to state the obvious now there is a platform for black lives matter and it's at our but that's one person who was making that point right and I\nI think though that um that you know even Hillary\nClinton is coming from a paradigm of looking at this through a very specific lens and the process of movement organizing and and political organizing that I'm Still plays by the rules of of the old guard which is largely white ... which means non transgender straight men\nUm and the rules were created by them to uh to protect them and to keep sort of the status quo in place um and I don't know that I agree that uh we have to follow those rules in order to to get things done\nI Will carry last word goes do you hear what do you make of it when the president says it's a hard time for for for men in this country [laughter]\nWell I Can't comment on the president how fast the law in New York but I Do you think what I should do at that time on the air with a lot of New York is call in the legal profession and call in the medical profession because all those aggressions that you're talking about ... experience\nThose are things you can learn to stop dealing and start learning best practices and it's your responsibility to live down that yesterday you're going to make mistakes [noise]\nKeep keep at it showing up [noise] All right senator of an estimated feud dodge the question skillfully are put in your capacity as an attorney I understand kid is staff attorney is legal assistance of western New York thanks for being here appreciate your time and our thanks to my little ...\nYou teach you plug civil rights attorney and founder and CEO of justice roots consulting nice to have you back with extra beta thanks nice to meet guinea Palmer good luck to you thanks for sharing your story really appreciate your experience and comment you made your day they had like you were having\nOur thanks to Rob breathing the engineer Gary put up during the work behind the glass today thank Gary Megan back as producer connection I'm Evan doesn't have a lovely weekend hope you're surrounded by love or wherever you go and we'll talk to you Monday [noise]\n\n\n\nThis program is a production of W ... public radio the views expressed you're not necessarily represent those are the station\nStaff management were underwriters the broadcast is meant for the private use of our audience any rebroadcast or use in another medium without express written consent of W ... you're strictly prohibited\nConnections with ...
