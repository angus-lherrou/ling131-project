Pompeo has been in Asia for the last few days he spent several hours and young with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un they talked about denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and scheduling second meeting with President Trump\nCalled it a good trip when he was in Beijing Today and that visit was notably not as good Chinese foreign minister ... had some sharp words for ... about the state of U.S China relations\nNPR's Anthony Kuhn is in Beijing and he joins us now hands any hey they're also so what exactly what sat in front of reporters what were these remarks that were so critical to us from China\nWill ... really started out on a pretty harsh note saying that the U.S it constantly escalated trading tensions with China waited harm China's interest in regards to Taiwan\nAnd it it made a lot of baseless accusations against Chinas foreign and domestic policies wanting noted that Pompeo would come to brief him about his trip to North Korea and to seek China's cooperation and he said this is exactly why we should be cooperating and not confronting each other\nDid pay a respond to any of these criticisms in front of reporters\nWell he said the U.S in China where in fundamental disagreement on ... points and I think what came out through this was that China feels that the U.S is just launching an all out sort of Cold War on every front\nAnd I think this has something to do with this speech that vice president Mike Pence gave last week\nWhere he accused China of malign efforts to undermine President Trump in the upcoming elections\nYeah that was just one of the things I mean really it was across the board from stealing American intellectual property to human rights as a treatment of the week or a minority in she's young it was really confrontational and very little talk of cooperation\nWhy with Chinese officials take such a fence at Mike Pence's speech if the vast majority of what he was saying substantively it steps the U.S has long been saying about China was it the particular tone Pence took or\nIs it the timing that right now you know ... trying to keep good relations with China when it comes to North Korea and this was just an inconvenience speech to be giving welcome it was making this trip\n[noise] you know this has been building up earlier this year we had a national security strategy an official document which basically means China as one of the main threats\nFacing the U.S so that's part of the attitude\nYou know I I think it's really just China feels that this marks a shift away from cooperation and towards confrontation this this depiction of China is really a rogue regime and one of the top threats to us security that it has to be dealt with harshly\nI really think that's the tone that China's reacting to and I think it will be reacting to it I think that's going to be sinking in for quite a while\nNow under previous administrations officials had been reluctant to push Beijing too hard on on trade or or other issues the U.S has been critical of when it comes to China\nOr because of this idea that it needs China's help when it comes to North Korea so could President Trump's top stance with China hurt the U.S his ability to reach a deal with North Korea\nAre well certainly that's the implication of what happened today of course we're seeing a confluence of factors is not just the north Korea issue\nThat the U.S needs China's help on it's it's just so many issues of global importance but the U.S seems to want to put a competition with China in front of cooperation on these global issues\nAll right That's NPR's

Chang mid term elections have often been seen as a referendum on the president and his party\nMany presidents try to shy away from that idea but not Donald Trump he has a lot on the line next month and news as NPR's Mara Liasson reports\nWhat does Donald Trump think is at stake on election day well just about everything\nDemocrats [noise]\nThey're going to raise your taxes you get a prime all over the place you're going to people across the border you lose your rights to those guns you're going to ruin your Medicare watch\nAnd that's not even the worst of it\nThey want to jump in June Venezuela\nThey really do even for Trump that's pretty alarmist but according to Newt Gingrich the president is right to be doing everything he can to scare his supporters into voting getting rich who became house speaker when a Democratic president last midterm election knows that midterms can have serious consequences for a White House\nLosing the house is is a problem losing the sun has catastrophe\nAnother way to put it no Senate no judges no house no legislation\nIf you suddenly had McConnell in the minority and Schumer controlling the calendar you would get virtually no judge approved in the house the big the big problem will be the job of endless investigations of everybody\nEndless investigations including possibly impeachment of everybody meaning not just people in the west wing but every Trump cabinet official an agency had done high is the former communications director for the Republican National committee\nDemocrats are going to investigate this president in an intense way that we've never seen before and Republicans were pretty intense on rock Obama this will take it to a to point out pretty quickly\nYou mean like the been God's the investigation on steroids\nThis has been ... in every committee affecting every department an agency and also means that Trump's I is necessarily going to be taken off the ball of job creation and doing those things that he should be able to tell voters\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says on the other hand if the Republicans hang on than Trump style of leadership is validated and he has a free hand to do pretty much what he wants\nIf the Republicans are re elected to the majority of the nation of the president's policies and that means his opportunity to continue to get his America First agenda accomplish\nOther presidents who've lost control of Congress managed to find some areas of common ground with the opposition think Bill Clinton Trump could try to do that says former George W. Bush advisor Karl Rove but it will be harder now\nIt is possible to triangulate which is another way of saying working across party lines and finding allies\nOn particular issues but we're talking about a climate today that is much different than the climate that we had Twenty years ago and so if the Democrats were taking hold it would be you know an ugly was not fun our\nSome supporters of the president paint a different picture if the Republicans lose the house they say Trump could use the Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi or her successor as a foil and cruise to re election way Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did the Corey Lewandowski isn't buying it\nI've heard people say that and whoever says that should be summarily fired because clearly they had no understanding of how politics works I think this president and his agenda and what you've been able to accomplish he's only been able to do because the Republicans had been in office\nOne thing both Democrats and Republicans agree on is that this White House is just not prepared for the consequences of losing former Bill Clinton advisor Paul the Gallup says no White House really is\nThey have no idea what it feels like I Do real is fifty six Estes go I feel that people would have felt like when there was sixty three it's a gut punch there's a very real psychological and political price\nPart of that price the rock solid hold President Trump has on the Republican Party in Congress could be shaken\nTrump rules his party by fear they're going to see him a lot less if they get their butts kicked he loses so much\nSo for Donald Trump whose entire persona is about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nMay not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house he also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beats he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily yard of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how on earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes them\nThe ... [noise] honestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore [laughter] really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last few years there has kind of been\nSteady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that they're really lengthy almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people got really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course there's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said\nAnything so they kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well you tell\nUs with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free heard to take more left leaning political positions now\n[noise] I think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drive so much of the country music industry now Herzog with her being played on pop radio and she'd have a broader audience\nI feel like it may have been trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still want to appeal to them but I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what would be why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd it was just what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and [laughter] I always had that I had her mind for me I'd read Beckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nIt was a struggle um I did I Lived in a mostly black poor neighborhood in Jackson, Mississippi and I went to a mostly white upper class private school just ten minutes away from my home but\nIn ten minutes it was like going into an entirely different world so I over compensated by doing what's called ... yeah um I Would make myself more presentable I thought um\nI was careful of ally spoke I was careful of how much emotion I showed\n'em and it was a struggle because so often I was silent on things that matter to me um and I would experience a micro aggressions from my classmates and I was silent about him I never called up the racism like what well one time one of my professors had a party at his house for Christmas\nAnd he had a huge Christmas tree with a big pile of gifts underneath and we could all pick a gift and it was like gag gift like we'll be cushions and all of this other stuff you just trying to get rid of\nAnd when it was my turn I picked the gifts\nAnd there was a prescription drug book inside and a toy water good and one of my classmates goes oh my God the black girl from the ghetto got the drug book and the gun how funny wow and because some of my classmates were laughing and I just made myself laugh because I thought I had to\nUm and that was one of those moments where I was so angry at myself for not speaking up and honestly that was a defining moment for me because I had to realize that I was speaking up for if nothing else and that they needed to know that even a joke like that is not okay so for me that was the moment I said you know what I Am not going to be silent again\nYeah one thing that was so fascinated with this movie doesn't only look at the disconnect between black and white it also touches upon where the black community can disagree like when stars uncle Carlos who's a cop straight up tell star how he would react to a black suspect\nA lot goes through a cops mind when they pull ... out of hiding something costs though but you still don't know if they did anything wrong [laughter] that's why we searched but if they open the door\nOr reached through an open window they're probably going for Web so far I think I see a gun I don't hesitate shoot\nIt was so interesting to hear a black man own that in this movie because it shows that you know this isn't just white against black racism it's much more complicated right you're you're saying George that it's not just white people that are to blame for the racial bias we've seen policing\nYes definitely use 'em that scene was a very important moment in the book\nAnd I really wanted to show off the side you know to is this the idea of how the system you know uh for police officers and how that goes all the way back to the idea of a slave patrols with free slaves and that's a system\nThat is taught in some time that system can be taught African Americans as well so you have that version and then also you have another layer on top of it is that sometimes as African Americans we have racism and buys them inside ourselves and how we see other African Americans as well\nAnd she you told this story through the eyes of a sixteen year old do you think audiences\nAre more capable of empathy when they're watching it kid rather than an adult for Apple with this kind of trauma receiving is kind of trauma unfortunately yeah yeah\nYeah when I first decided to write it I'm I'm a huge young adult fiction saying anyway and I always knew I wanted to write young adult fiction um but it was a definitely a decision early on to write this from the perspective of a sixteen year old girl\nFor several reasons I'm the first reason for me was because so often victims in these cases are teenagers or young people on Trayvon Martin was Seventeen Tamir Rice was twelve\nAnd I think about those kids who look at them and see themselves and I wanted to talk to them first and foremost\nUm but I also knew that when adults pick this book up they would be more likely to empathize with a sixteen year old girl them a thirty year old woman\nUm for some audiences there's something about getting it from the perspective of someone who has so much innocence who has so little experience you literally witness this girl become a woman you see her forced into adulthood because of her trauma and I think there's something about that at least for adults\nThere's something about seeing a child go do this\nAnd my hope was that people will look at real life sixteen year old in these cases and actually see them as children and not as adults\nRider Angie Thomas and director of Georgetown and Jews and their new movie is called the hate you give thank you both very much it was a real pleasure to talk to

been a vocal critic of the Saudi Government and he's been living in Turkey in self imposed exile\nEarlier today we spoke to Dominic Evans he's the Reuters bureau chief in Istanbul and he says ... went into the Saudi conflict last week to get some documents for his upcoming marriage\nAnd he never came out\nAnd then by Saturday four days after he went and uh we had from Tucker sources that their initial assessment was that he had been killed inside confident in what they said was premeditated murder\nIf that is true that the Saudi Government has indeed killed ... can you can you give us a sense of what he has written about that has so tremendously offended the Saudi Government\nShow I mean it's important to remember that he's not always been seen as an opposition journalists for for many years he was he was a a newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia he also worked for an advisor to all of a a prominent Saudi prince bought um about a year ago he left Saudi Arabia saying he\nWas worried about a possible retribution for what he was writing he has been critical of\nSaudi Arabia's foreign policy including the war in Yemen and he has also criticized\nThe Saudi leadership for its crackdown on dissent within the kingdom\nI understand that Saudi diplomats gave you a tour of their conflict is simple to try to prove to you and and other reporters that Reuters that ... was not there\nCurious how convincing was that tour tell me about it\n[noise] well it was certainly a a very unusual event as you say we went to the consulate we interviewed the consul general repeated what Saudi Arabia has set\nA ... shirt you went in on Tuesday I left shortly afterwards he then showed us around the country so that he said this was an extremely unusual things they've never done this before but they were trying to show\nThat show with not being held in the ... so they took us from the talked to the awesome and even the ... conditioning vents they open the cupboards yes to show that there was nothing suspicious that exactly\nBut to show you that he's not there doesn't exactly disapprove he hasn't been abducted and detained or killed somewhere else\nYou know I'm not a trained investigator that we were carrying out such but it was their attempt to show transparency to shove openness to show cooperation\nAnd Turkey's president has spoken out about this thing that they will investigate what is at stake for turkey\nWell turkey and Saudi Arabia has had pretty ... relations years at the same time it's been interesting that although we've heard from unnamed sources and an advisor to the president\nAbout this allegation the president has not publicly come out and launched a full scale um criticism of of Saudi Arabia that reflection of you know they you know what may be

Chang\nWe're going to take you back now to the late Eighteen hundreds when eating food in the U.S ... taking a calculated risk\nThe country was growing people were moving into cities and industrialized nation Gaye food producers new sometimes dangerous ways to stretch their products they were very inventive\nWith fake ... back then because there were no rules against it right it's completely legal to do whatever that's author Deborah Blum\nHer new book explores that era before the U.S enacted food safety rules my co host Ari Shapiro talk with her about it\nThe book is called the poisons squad one chemists single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century I started by asking ... someone living around Nineteen hundred might find in everyday foods like coffee candy or milk\nMilk was a a great example of just how bad things could get for a number of reasons one dairy men seeking to sort of stretch their profits would Senate with water it wasn't always clean water at one point there was actually a case in Indiana which it was pond water pond water\nPond water and and and it was a notice when the family found worms wiggling and the bombs\nAnd pond water was actually some of the safer stuff the milk was contaminated with\nThat's exactly right because once you would then the milk you add to reconstituted in all kinds of weird ways what chalk Dustin a papal plaster Dustin and\nThey look we're a cold ... and sometimes toxic dies like yellow lab to kind of make it more golden again instead of kind of grayish are bluish and then because it was prone to rot this is before ... and before refrigeration\nThey would dump preservatives in it and the most popular one was formaldehyde which is an embalming compound\nWhich is not good for humans to ingest\nNo and so you actually go out and can see newspaper headlines around the country during this period was embalmed milk scandals\nSo along comes the protagonist of your story Dr Harvey Washington widely and his title is chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture why did he cares so much about this issue [noise]\nAlways thought of them is kind of a how holy roller cameras right you of\nHarvey Washington while he was the son of my tenor a preacher and farmer in Indiana he was\nFather was a conductor on the underground railroad he was really raise I mean there's a real mid nineteenth century kind of child and he was really raised to think of what he did needing to be a higher calling and he would describe chemistry that way chemistry in the service of good\nAnd so when he became the chief chemist at the U.S department of agriculture\nI mean this is at a period where there is no FDA there is no consumer protection agency this tiny group of chemists that he commanded at the department of agriculture was it an foods\nSafety he took up that cause\nAnd your book is titled the poison squad comes from project which he undertook that really just shows his commitment to this ah describe it the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruit other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days a week super fancy meals are cooked by a professional chef of all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply the the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments and nine to you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and as they catch the national attention which they did they were a front page news there were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad ... stuffing their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there was this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association\nAnd and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this first food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when outsell a silk acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compounds\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story or something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who stands up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Rochester", "day": "08"}
