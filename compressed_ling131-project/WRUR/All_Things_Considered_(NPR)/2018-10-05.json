also felt total abandonment those stores ahead after\nThe news headlines live from NPR News in Washington I'm Luis given a Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has broken this is that she says she will be a yes on the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nMy fervent how is that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work to less than that ... in the Supreme Court so that we had far

the nomination in a closed procedural vote this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nI made me\nVery very difficult to get I mean that I can tell you\nMean they just may be that in mind\nHe's not the right man for the court and\nMeanwhile the American bar association has announced it is revisiting it's a valuation of Kavanaugh after last week's Judiciary Committee hearing a final Senate vote expected tomorrow evening\nThe jury has reached a verdict in a murder trial of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke guilty second degree murder he was accused of shooting Seventeen year old and the clown McDonalds who was holding a knife sixteen times in October of two thousand fortune\nThe release of police dash cam video of the shooting sparked massive protests three years ago that guy was also found guilty of sixteen counts of aggravated battery with a weapon not guilty of official misconduct\nThere soaking grains of Hurricane Florence appear to have gambling job growth last month but as NPR's Scott Horsley reports on unemployment continues to fall to its lowest level in nearly fifty years\nUh lately I think the idea that someone who was accused of this could reach a level of such power despite women coming forward and telling their stories about that it's really alarming to them a ... it's not about I mean a lot of these women were talking about how the anger of women these women were angry they were more gutted\nOr that this could happen that these stories of women even if folks say like center called and said that she believes that Dr Ford suffered some thing but that there is no proof that it was him well the idea usually when it's an acquaintance situation that\nA memory works that way I mean Dr Cavanaugh is a scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough\nTo stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about uh for the count against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more broadly\nSo I I I think that it's an important ... to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to a great deal in her and her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any corroboration and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm In the case of ray Moore when he came up\nAnd accusers came forward to the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and expressed sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get or don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years you don't want\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and\nAnd sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been a very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we ... we saw Brett Stevens and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone um let on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that I'm Susie ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was if the Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play\nI I don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now on the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war uh it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president or with the comments that you played\nA I think that really spurs the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like having a will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly it\nCould I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be the function so it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\nYeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think have announced one of them I I I'm not sure how much of this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I think that this probably did may be pushing more right were then he would have otherwise been had to spend as smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of Rick a sham columnist for the forward

I think that response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because you mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after our break he apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and sorting gang rape\nTo handle a lot and you're laughing now but at the time like ... were you a quiet kid ... like how did you take this and what they were very funny people\nTo see my grandfather would say you know when they when they barely put me closer to the street so I could sneak out at night and then my grandmother basket [laughter]\nThat is an all you know we're on the radio so you can't see me but I my Ming taking a cigarette in and out because that's how they that's how they spoke [laughter] my grandmother reminded me\nOften that I was very lucky not to be addicted to heroin when I was born uh she was the you know anytime there might be a news report you know in the in the early mid eighties about kids who are addicted to drugs when they were born she would just pull out her cigarettes like you know you you're lucky you were born like that right you know that right\nOkay yeah you know whatever\nSo you begin to draw right but when you're very young and what kind of outlet does that come for you\nI becomes an escape it becomes the one world that I can control right so um it by the time ... it's therapeutic it gets my mind off things my mind as they are on the page uh part of my research into this book because I said every sketchbook\nI had throat my my teen years really and looking through them\nAll I can think about that kid was angry\nYou know what I my grandparents never once considered you know putting me into therapy ... part of that was their generation you know they they came of age and the great depression you just you just didn't talk about things\nUm and so I I you know I had friends that I could speak too I I certainly had some adults in my life I could speak to family members and and teachers at school who always very patiently offered ... listening ear to me\nBut the sketchbooks to be able to work through some of this sort of darkness I had in my head um they gave me an outlet\nYou right in your dedication you write ... addition to your grandparents and mom you say that the book is called for every reader who recognizes this experience ICU\nThere there is a rise and the number of uh grandparents raising their kids right out of the ... crisis and when you read these stories [laughter]\nDo you think oh God there's a lot of kids who who are gonna go through what I'm going through or what I what I went through\nThere are a lot of kids going through that now and of course when I was a kid I thought it was the only one in America being raised by my grandparents you know and I didn't take any other my peers and my elementary school and grade school had these sorts ... problems\nAnd come to find out later I mean they certainly did so I I Hope that dedication to young readers who are experiencing a similar attracting life might feel less alone by that to know that I'm acknowledging that this might be an experience that they are also having\nIn the book you do kind of reconcile with your birth father you find him and you develop a kind of relationship um with your birth mother do you feel like you ended up having a good relationship do you feel like you kind of gave her for how you grow up\nWe had a great relationship for a number of years so she's she's skipped my high school graduation which is weird this book ends ... ... spoiler alert ... graduated high school and ... and um\nSo I went off to college without having had any contact with her uh but my my grandparents made sure that we're all together for Thanksgiving and so over the years we did develop a great\nRelationship um we danced at my wedding you know she got to meet\nMy first two kids um but it was it was it was when my second child was born that she started getting into trouble again started getting arrested again and I'm ... law she wasn't safe ... say as much it was it was pretty clear that she started using again and she certainly was\nA surrounding herself by some nefarious individuals\nBut I did ... my last discussion that last time I saw her was about a year before she died and we we left it was she said to me I Love you and I always will and without missing ... beat and I said I I Love you and I always well um she she never really took ownership though of of any of the stuff that happens um\nShe would often say when are you just going to get over it which is a tough thing to say to a kid or ... you sort of learn to move pass things but it's it's certainly nice when it's at least someone owns up to their poor behavior right which ... she was never able to do\nWell ... think he's so much for speaking with nothing for sharing your family's story\nWell thank you so much for having ... pleasure and are truly honor to be here ... new

final outcome but with Republican swing vote Susan Collins and Jeff Flake announcing their support for Kavanaugh he appeared to have the backing you needs for confirmation at least that's the hope of White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders\nSaid Kavanaugh has demonstrated exactly what you would want out of a Supreme Court justice he said that over the last several months and I think that I'm moving

respected institutions in the country\nAnd a lot of people are asking would affect the partisan fight over Cavanaugh I might have on the high court\nA question no one is better poised to enter even NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg Hi Nina high so speaking of partisanship I'm going to get to the effect on the court in a second but start with the partisanship that a lot of people saw on display when Brett Kavanaugh testified last week he talked about the\n... that he was being targeted as revenge for the Clintons you've covered a lot of Supreme Court confirmation fights have had you ever seen anything like that\nLook in historical terms nothing like this has ever happened before\nA Supreme Court nominee using part isn't language to describe not just the senators but all of his opponents and couching the opposition\nPurely in terms of anger over the over the twenty sixteen presidential election Kavanaugh's performance in fact cause retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican to speak out against the nominee\nAnd he said that he'd like Kavanaugh as a judge even put his picture in one of his books because of a decision that Kevin wrote but Kavanaugh his demeanor and partisanship Stevenson Steven said demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court\nThat he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities and might have to recuse himself because of that a parent bias here's here's Stevens speaking to a group in Florida yesterday\nFor the record who it is not the ill to get a new justice that can only do part time job\nNow I don't really think the Kavanaugh as likely to recuse himself and indeed you saw him today in the wall Street Journal and an op ed piece trying to somehow walked back some of his comments without specify which ones it\nAppears are based on how things are shaking out in the Senate today that um plenty of senators enough senators are prepared to vote to confirm Kavanaugh despite all these questions being raised by Justice Stevens than others so what does that mean for the politics of the court or at least the appearance of the court that it should be above politics\nWell the justices will grit their teeth and and they'll put on a good show in public and private I suspect chief justice John Roberts knows and has stressed that the courts best currency is the notion that it's not a partisan institution that there may be ideological differences but not partisan once\nAnd all of this cannot be sitting well with him\nRepublican Susan Collins of Maine a made a dramatic speech today weighing in on some of these questions she was announcing her support for Kavanaugh here's a little bit of what she had to say\nMy fervent hall is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we had far fewer five four decisions\n[noise] how big a challenge is that going to be enough for for Brett Kavanaugh at this stage to lessen divisions\n[laughter] well you don't even have to go there just are you have to do is look at his record Collins framed it as a quite moderate record today but there's a reason that President Trump added cabinet to that list of potential candidates for the court\nAnd that is that on questions ranging from gun regulation to executive power to abortion to overall regulations he is firmly in the conservative some would even say ultraconservative vein of judicial ideology so I Would\nIndeed expect eventually anyway lots of five to four votes where the five justice conservative majority firmly entrenched a court that is far more conservative that ... than any we have seen in this country for\nI Would say probably three quarters of the sense of a century how fast that happens well that remains to be seen\nJust a couple of seconds left but if this vote goes as expected this weekend how quickly would you expect him to be seated I Would expect him to be seated probably
